introduction this management s discussion and analysis contains certain financial measures  in particular presentation of certain balances excluding the impact of acquisitions and other non recurring items that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we present these non gaap financial measures because they provide our management and readers of this report with additional insight into our operational performance compared to earlier periods and relative to our competitors performance 
we do not intend for these non gaap financial measures to substitute for any gaap financial information 
readers should use these non gaap financial measures only in conjunction with the comparable gaap financial measures 
we use earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to evaluate our operating performance and to compute certain management bonuses and compliance with covenants in our revolving credit facility 
we believe that ebitda is an important indicator of operating performance because ebitda excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest  depreciation and goodwil impairment costs 
investors should not use ebitda as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions  as it excludes a number of important items and has inherent limitations 
we compensate for these limitations by also using gaap financial measures to manage our business 
business overview corporate update separation 
on june   fac completed the separation by which it separated into two independent  publicly traded companies through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of fafc to the holders of fac common shares  par value per share as of may  after the distribution  fafc owned the businesses that comprised fac s financial services businesses and fac retained its information solutions businesses

the separation and distribution agreement also governs the relationship between the company and fafc subsequent to the completion of the separation and provides for the allocation between the company and fafc of fac s assets and liabilities 
in connection with the separation  the company and fafc also entered into a tax sharing agreement as described in note income taxes  a restrictive covenants agreement  and corelogic issued a promissory note to fafc relating to certain pension liabilities 
while we are a party to the separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements relating to the separation  we have determined that we have no material continuing involvement in fafc s operations 
as a result of the separation  we reflect the fafc businesses in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
the results of the fafc businesses in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the classification 
see note discontinued operations for additional disclosures 
as part of the separation  we are responsible for a portion of fafc s contingent and other corporate liabilities 
there were no amounts outstanding at december  as part of the distribution  on may  we issued to fafc approximately million of our issued and outstanding common shares  or  shares 
based on the closing price of our stock on june   the value of the equity issued to fafc was million 
as a result  we paid fafc million to arrive at the full value of million 
as a condition to the separation  fafc is expected to dispose of the shares by june  acquisition of experian s interest in corelogic real estate solutions  llc joint venture

the businesses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and the results of those businesses in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the classification 
see note discontinued operations for additional disclosures 
reportable segments in connection with the separation and the subsequent sale of the employer and litigation services businesses  we reorganized our reportable segments into two reportable segments business and information services our business and information services segment provides tax monitoring  flood zone certification and monitoring  mortgage default management services  mortgage loan administration and production services  mortgage related business process outsourcing and property valuation and management services 
we are also a provider of geospatial proprietary software and databases combining geographic mapping and data 
the segment s primary customers are large  national mortgage lenders and servicers  but we also serve regional mortgage lenders and brokers  credit unions  commercial banks  government agencies and property and casualty insurance companies 
our business and information services segment has two components mortgage origination services  which is focused on the mortgage origination and servicing industry  and default and technology services  which is primarily oriented toward services required by owners servicers of troubled mortgage assets and toward providing custom outsourcing solutions for a wide range of customers 
most of the businesses included in the mortgage origination services group have a relatively high proportion of fixed costs due to the ongoing servicing nature of the operations 
the group s appraisal businesses  in contrast  have a higher level of variable costs 
the businesses within the default and technology services group typically have a high level of variable costs 
revenues for the mortgage originations services group are primarily dependent on the level of mortgage origination and servicing activity while default and technology services group revenues are generally tied to the level of troubled loan activity in the united states 
data and analytics our data and analytics segment offers access to data assets including loan information  criminal and eviction records  employment verification  property characteristic information  images of publicly recorded documents relating to real property  and information on mortgage backed securities 
we license our data directly to our customers and provide our customers with analytical products and services for risk management  collateral assessment  and fraud prediction 
our primary customers are commercial banks  mortgage lenders and brokers  investment banks  fixed income investors  real estate agents  property and casualty insurance companies  title insurance companies and government sponsored enterprises 
our data and analytics segment has two components risk and fraud analytics  which is primarily oriented toward utilizing our property  mortgage and other data assets in custom and packaged risk management solutions  and specialty finance solutions  which provides our credit  broker and multiple listing services products 
most of the businesses included in the risk and fraud analytics group are database intensive and have a relatively high proportion of fixed costs 
as a result  profit margins generally decline as revenues decrease 
the specialty finance solutions group has a more variable cost structure and  therefore  has margins that typically perform more consistently 
revenues for the data and analytics segment are dependent on real estate activity in part  but are less cyclical because the data and analytics segment has a more diversified customer base and a greater percentage of subscription based revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the accounting policies described below to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingencies 
our assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  we cannot determine future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in
