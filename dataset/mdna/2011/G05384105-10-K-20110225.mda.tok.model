item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current market conditions  rate trends and developments in early any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly  and we expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
to the extent these trends emerge  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
if actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations  our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of our contracts in most of our lines of business are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write on a renewal basis because of pricing conditions  our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a larger number of reinsurance contacts are subject to renewal 
we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents  general agents and other producers exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
from time to time  we authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us 
we must rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us 
although we monitor our underwriting on an ongoing basis  our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
to the extent that our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the aggregated risks associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
in our reinsurance treaty business  we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under most reinsurance treaties 
this is common among reinsurers 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk 
table of contents that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded to us may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume and the losses we may incur 
the failure of any risk management and loss limitation methods including risk transfer tools we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  such that we must pay losses that exceed a specified retention 
in addition  we limit program size for each client and from time to time purchase reinsurance for our own account 
reinsurance purchased may not always act in the way intended in the event of a claim due to ambiguities in the wordings leading to potential disputes 
in the case of proportional property reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event  though we may not be able to obtain such limits based on market conditions at such time 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
we also apply a similar approach to our political risk exposures 
various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner we intend 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective or that disputes relating to coverage will be resolved in our favor 
as a result of the risks we insure and reinsure  unforeseen events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the reinsurance that we purchase may not be available on favorable terms or we may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amount of reinsurance or retrocession protection on terms that are acceptable to us from entities with a satisfactory credit rating 
we also may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years due to pricing  terms and conditions or strategic emphasis 
we have sought previously alternative ways of reducing our risk such as catastrophe bonds  and we may seek other ways such as contingent capital  sidecars or other capital market solutions  which solutions may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional retrocession 
our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection for our own account could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be significantly adversely affected 
our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
to the extent actual claims exceed our expectations  we will be required immediately to recognize the less favorable experience 
this could cause a material increase in our provisions for liabilities and a reduction in our profitability  including operating losses and reduction of capital 
if natural catastrophic events or other large losses occur  we may fail to adequately estimate our reserve requirements and our actual losses and loss expenses may deviate  perhaps substantially  from our reserve estimates 

table of contents there are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them 
in property reinsurance  there is still the potential for adverse development from litigation associated with hurricane katrina 
in casualty reinsurance  there are additional uncertainties associated with claims emanating from the global financial crisis 
there is also a potential for new areas of claims to emerge as underlying this segment are many long tail lines of business 
in the insurance segment  we wrote a book of financial institutions risks which have a number of notifications relating to the financial crisis in and and there is also a specific area of uncertainty relating to a book of new york contractor business 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish reserves for losses and loss expenses  which include case reserves and ibnr reserves  until an event which gives rise to a claim occurs 
as a result  only reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be set aside on our financial statements  with no allowance for the provision of loss reserves to account for possible other future losses 
see item above  business reserves and part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further description of our reserving process and methodology 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflated costs of settling claims 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write liability casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia and certain other territories  where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
see also part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
market and liquidity risks we may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and bond yields 
our financial condition and operating results are affected by the performance of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains fixed income securities which are valued in the balance sheet at market value 
the market value of fixed income securities generally moves in the contrary direction to the market yields of bonds 
thus their value declines when bond yields rise 
bond yields may rise or fall in response to market expectations of future interest rates and as a result of changes in the market valuation of the credit worthiness of the relevant issuers 
bond yields were volatile during  which impacted our financial results 
changes in bond yields also affect the rate at which funds are reinvested and this may have an adverse effect on investment income and consequently on the results of operations 
interest rates and bond yields are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our interest rate strategy includes maintaining a portfolio  diversified by obligor and emphasizing higher rated securities  with a short duration of years to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
in addition we are currently using interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk where we pay fixed and receive floating coupons 
despite our mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value and results of operations 

table of contents deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to investment losses  which could affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
our funds are invested by several professional investment management firms under the direction of our investment committee in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us 
see business investments under item  above 
although our investment policies stress diversification of risks  conservation of principal and liquidity through conservative investment guidelines  our investments are subject to general economic conditions  market risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including  among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies  defaults  and significant ratings downgrades of some credits  may put our investments at risk 
market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent 
depending on market conditions  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods 
separately  the occurrence of large claims may force us to liquidate securities at an inopportune time  which may cause us to realize capital losses 
large investment losses could decrease our asset base  thereby affecting our ability to underwrite new business 
additionally  such losses could have a material adverse impact on our equity  business and financial strength and debt ratings 
for the twelve months ended december   or million  of our income before tax was derived from our net invested assets 
unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with some of our investments could significantly and negatively affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
we hold  and may in the future purchase  certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as non agency residential mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities and our reinvestment of million in cartesian iris a lp cartesian iris offshore fund lp  which was formed to provide capital for a new bermudian reinsurer  focusing on insurance linked securities 
these investments represented approximately of our investment portfolio as of december  during the height of the financial crisis even some of our very high quality assets were more illiquid than normal 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments  our investments in the asset classes described above and  at times  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in unfavorable market conditions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our investment portfolio includes below investment grade or unrated securities that have a higher degree of credit or default risk which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  investment grade securities 
however  as a result of downgrades  a small portion of the portfolio is in below investment grade or unrated securities 
at december   below investment grade or unrated securities comprised approximately of our investment portfolio 
these securities also have a higher degree of credit or default risk and are much less liquid than the rest of our portfolio 
these securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions 
while we have put in place investment guidelines to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets  it is possible that  in periods of prolonged economic weakness  we may experience default losses in our portfolio 
this may result in a reduction of net income and capital  adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our segments are the us dollar  the british pound  the euro  the swiss franc  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the singaporean dollar 
during the course of  the us dollar british pound exchange rate  our most significant exchange rate exposure  fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
for the twelve months ended december   and   and  respectively  of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us non british currencies  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have used forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully structure those contracts so as to effectively manage these risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
credit risks our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
however  due to the unsettled and fact specific nature of the law  we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses related to such credit risks 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
see item above  business business distribution for our principal brokers by segment 
several of these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that compete with us  and these brokers may favor their own insurers or reinsurers over other companies 
in addition  as brokers merge with  or acquire  each other  there could be further strain on our ability to access business through a reduction in distribution channels 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our purchase of reinsurance subjects us to third party credit risk 
we purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of certain large and multiple losses upon our financial condition 
our reinsurers are dependent on their ratings in order to continue to write business  and some have suffered downgrades in ratings as a result of their exposures in the past 
our reinsurers may also be affected by recent adverse developments in the financial markets  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
a reinsurer s insolvency  its inability to continue to write business or its reluctance to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on us because we may remain liable to our insureds or cedants 

table of contents certain of our policyholders and intermediaries may not pay premiums owed to us due to bankruptcy or other reasons 
bankruptcy  liquidity problems  distressed financial condition or the general effects of economic recession may increase the risk that policyholders or intermediaries  such as insurance brokers  may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us  despite an obligation to do so 
the terms of our contracts may not permit us to cancel our insurance even though we have not received payment 
if non payment becomes widespread  whether as a result of bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure or otherwise  it could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the impairment of financial institutions increases our counterparty risk 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and other institutions 
we also hold as investments various fixed interest securities issued by financial institutions  which may be unsecured 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  with respect to secured transactions  our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it 
any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our ability to pay dividends or to meet ongoing cash requirements may be constrained by our holding company structure 
we are a holding company and  as such  have no substantial operations of our own 
we do not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of our insurance subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions and loans from our insurance subsidiaries are expected to be our sole source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including our debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  to our preference shareholders and ordinary shareholders  if any 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends and make loans to other group companies 
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see business regulatory matters bermuda regulation restrictions on dividends  business regulatory matters uk and uk regulation restrictions on dividend payments  and business regulatory matters us entities and regulation state dividend limitations in item  above 
certain regulatory and other constraints may limit our ability to pay dividends 
we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make other distributions 
under the bermuda companies act  we may declare or pay a dividend out of contributed surplus only if we have reasonable grounds to believe that we are  and would after the payment be  able to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
there are further restrictions to those outlined above and as such if you require dividend income you should carefully consider these risks before investing in us 
for more information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and our insurance subsidiaries  see business regulatory matters in item  above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity in part ii  item 
table of contents strategic risks we operate in a highly competitive environment  and substantial new capital inflows into the insurance and reinsurance industry may increase competition 
the insurance and reinsurance markets continue to be highly competitive 
we continue to compete with existing international and regional insurers and reinsurers some of which have greater financial  marketing  and management resources than we do 
we also compete with new companies entering the market and with alternative products such as insurance risk linked securities  catastrophe bonds and derivatives 
see business competition under item  above for a list of our competitors 
there has also been a move for insureds to retain a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously  and industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies  and other mechanisms for funding their risks  rather than risk transferring insurance 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
we have recently experienced increased competition in some lines of business which has caused a decline in rate increases or a reduction in rates 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent events may result in political  regulatory and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business 
governments may take unpredictable action to ensure continued supply of insurance particularly where a large event leads to withdrawal of capacity from the market 
as a result of the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  a number of government initiatives have been launched recently that are designed to stabilize market conditions 
the us federal government  federal reserve  us treasury and government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other extraordinary actions to address the global financial crisis 
there can be no assurance as to the effect that any such governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on our competitive position  business and financial condition in particular 
see regulatory risks below 
our insurance subsidiaries are rated  and our lloyd s business benefits from a rating by one or more of am best  s p and moody s  and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review by  and may be placed on credit watch  revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of  am best  s p and or moody s 
am best affirmed aspen bermuda s and aspen uk s financial strength rating to a excellent 
in addition  aspen specialty s and aaic s rating was affirmed as part of the aspen group rating 
our business written through syndicate also benefits from lloyd s rating which is currently a excellent by am best and a strong by s p 
if our or lloyd s ratings are reduced from their current levels by any of am best  moody s or s p  our competitive position in the insurance industry might suffer and it might be more difficult for us to market our products and to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements 
a downgrade also may require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their insurance and reinsurance contracts with us 
some contracts also provide for the return of premium to the ceding client in the event of a downgrade 
it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain such terms 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings and therefore may materially and adversely impact our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial flexibility 

table of contents a downgrade of the financial strength rating of aspen uk  aspen bermuda or aspen specialty by am best below b or by s p below a would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility with barclays bank plc and other lenders  which might adversely impact our liquidity and financial flexibility 
if we fail to develop the necessary infrastructure as we grow  our future financial results may be adversely affected 
our expansion will continue to place increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
in  we increased our business written in latin america  entered the us admitted insurance market  added a uk regional platform and established an office in cologne  germany and an insurance branch in zurich  switzerland 
in addition  the increased regulatory complexity of our business brought about by operating in multiple jurisdictions increases our regulatory risk profile 
to the extent we are unable to attract additional professionals  our financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives  potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and systems to effectively support such transition or expansion 
our inability to achieve such development or to manage effectively such growth may impair our future financial results 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our long term strategy  we may pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in businesses or new underwriting or marketing platforms 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business  new personnel  new underwriting or marketing platforms could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation  higher levels of claims than is reflected in reserves and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any future acquisitions may expose us to operational risks including integrating financial and operational reporting systems  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses  the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected  and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification  reinsurance and other obligations to us 
we have limited experience in identifying quality merger candidates  as well as successfully acquiring and integrating their operations 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions  strategic investments or new platforms will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may fail to execute our strategy in new lines of business and territories  which would impair our future financial results 
we continue to expand our operations and in  among other things  increased business written in latin america  established a uk regional platform and a swiss insurance branch 
our expansion into new lines of business such as professional liability insurance  global excess casualty and non marine transportation liability in  financial and political risk  financial institutions and management and 
table of contents technology liability insurance in  specie and credit and surety reinsurance business incepting in and non us agriculture reinsurance and professional liability  d o and excess casualty insurance in the us in  presents us with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
we are continuing to strengthen the operational processes to support these lines of business 
in general  our techniques for evaluating and modeling risk in these new lines of business are not as developed as the models for pre existing lines of business 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these new lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  to deploy capital into more profitable business lines  to identify acquisition opportunities  to manage investments and preserve capital in volatile markets  and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
to the extent that our funds are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and or cover claims losses  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
our additional needs for capital will depend on our actual claims experience  especially for any catastrophic events 
any equity  hybrid or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our debt  credit and international swap dealers association isda agreements may limit our financial and operational flexibility  which may affect our ability to conduct our business 
we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
additionally  we have entered into credit facilities and isda agreements with various institutions 
under these credit facilities  the institutions provide revolving lines of credit to us and our major operating subsidiaries and issue letters of credit to our clients in the ordinary course of business 
the agreements relating to our debt  credit facilities and isda agreements contain various covenants that may limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
some of these agreements also require us to maintain specified ratings and financial ratios  including a minimum net worth covenant 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet required financial ratios  the lenders or counterparties under these agreements could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them 
if we are in default under the terms of these agreements  then we would also be restricted in our ability to declare or pay any dividends  redeem  purchase or acquire any shares or make a liquidation payment 
we may be unable to enter into sufficient reinsurance security arrangements and the cost of these arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as non us reinsurers  aspen bermuda and aspen non us are required to post collateral security with respect to liabilities they assume from ceding insurers domiciled in the united states 
the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit in their us statutory financial statements with respect to liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trust assets are held by the ceding company 
aspen uk and aspen bermuda are required to post 
table of contents letters of credit or establish other security for their us cedants in an amount equal to of reinsurance recoverables under the agreements to which they are a party with the us cedants 
as a result of the dodd frank act  beginning on july   only a ceding insurer s state of domicile can dictate the credit for reinsurance requirements 
other states in which a ceding insurer is licensed will no longer be able to require additional collateral from non admitted reinsurers or otherwise impose their own credit for reinsurance laws on ceding insurers domiciled in other states 
we note that as a result  several states have begun efforts to change their credit for reinsurance laws and regulations as florida and new york already have  so that qualifying non admitted reinsurers meeting certain minimum rating and capital requirements would  upon application to the state insurance departments  be permitted to post less than the collateral currently required in most us states 
aspen us and aspen bermuda intend to seek approval to post reduced collateral in relevant states 
we have currently in place letters of credit facilities and trust funds  as further described in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  to satisfy these requirements 
if these facilities are not sufficient or if we are unable to renew these facilities at their expiration due to credit market constraints or unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of aspen bermuda and aspen uk to provide reinsurance to uk based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties and  consequently  reduce the liquidity of our assets 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda or uk law or under our investment guidelines 
these restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could adversely affect our profitability 
as at december   we had million in trust funds or pledged as collateral for secured letters of credit 
the development of our us based insurance operations is subject to increased risk from changing market conditions 
excess and surplus lines insurance is a substantial portion of the business written by our us based insurance operations 
excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting 
as a result  excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers 
our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market 
if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
further  the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general 
this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market 
during times of hard market conditions when market conditions are more favorable to insurers  as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive  business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market 
when soft market conditions are prevalent when market conditions are less favorable to insurers  standard insurance carriers tend to loosen underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines  exacerbating the effect of rate decreases 
if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 

table of contents regulatory risks the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations in territories where we currently engage in business or obtain them in new territories  or may be able to do so only at significant cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or to engage in certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business

we can give no assurance that the existence or effect of such connected party transactions and the fsa s assessment of the overall solvency of aspen holdings and its subsidiaries  even in circumstances where aspen uk has on its face sufficient assets of its own to cover its required margin of solvency  would not result in regulatory intervention by the fsa with regard to aspen uk aspen uk may be required to hold additional capital in order to meet the fsa s solvency requirements 
aspen uk is required to provide the fsa with information about aspen holdings notional solvency  which involves calculating the solvency position of aspen holdings in accordance with the fsa s rules 
in this regard  if aspen bermuda  aspen specialty or syndicate were to experience financial difficulties  it could affect the solvency position of aspen holdings and in turn trigger regulatory intervention by the fsa with respect to aspen uk the fsa requires insurers and reinsurers to calculate their ecr  an indicative measure of the capital resources a firm may need to hold  based on risk sensitive calculations applied to its business profile which includes capital charges based on assets  claims and premiums 
the fsa may give guidance regularly to insurers under individual capital 
table of contents guidance  which may result in guidance that a company should hold capital in excess of the ecr 
these changes may increase the required regulatory capital of aspen uk  impacting our profitability 
changes at the eu level may also affect aspen uk and amal 
in addition  given that the framework for supervision of insurance and reinsurance companies in the united kingdom must comply with eu directives which are implemented by member states through national legislation  changes at the eu level may affect the regulatory scheme under which aspen uk  amal and aul will operate 
we can give no assurance as to how eu and other relevant laws will be applied within the sectors in which aspen uk is currently active 
unexpected changes to market practices may be necessary or desirable as a result of any action taken by the eu commission  which may impact our results of operations 
the eu directive on solvency ii may affect the way in which aspen uk manages its business and may lead to aspen bermuda posting collateral in respect of its eea cedants 
an eu directive covering the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  known as solvency ii  was adopted by the european parliament in april and is expected to be implemented on december  solvency ii presents a number of risks to aspen uk and amal 
the fsa s existing regime is expected to meet many of the new measures but insurers are expecting to undertake a significant amount of work to ensure that they will meet the new requirements and this may divert finite resources from other business related tasks 
in addition  the measures implementing solvency ii are currently subject to a consultation process and are not expected to be finalized until late  consequently  aspen s implementation plans are based on its current understanding of the solvency ii requirements  which may change 
increases in capital requirements as a result of solvency ii may be required and may impact our results of operations 
further  under solvency ii  unless the european commission assesses the regulatory regime in bermuda as equivalent to solvency ii  then aspen bermuda may be required to post collateral in respect of any reinsurance of eea cedants  including aspen uk  which may have a negative impact on aspen bermuda s and aspen holdings results 
this is because under solvency ii  the prohibition on eea member states imposing collateral requirements on its cedants wishing to take credit for reinsurance only applies in cases of the reinsurers who are situated in a country whose solvency regime is deemed equivalent to solvency ii 
therefore  if bermuda s solvency regime is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii  then aspen bermuda s eea cedants may be required to seek collateral from aspen bermuda in order for the cedant to take credit for such reinsurance 
the european union s committee of european insurance and occupational pensions supervisors ceiops has recommended to the european commission that bermuda be among the first countries assessed for equivalence with solvency ii 
however  the final decision as to whether bermuda is deemed equivalent to solvency ii can only be made by the european commission  which has stated that it will publish its decisions on equivalence by july as of january   the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa replaces ceiops 
the activities of aspen uk may be subject to review by other insurance regulators 
aspen uk is authorized to do business in the united kingdom and has permission to conduct business in canada  switzerland  australia  singapore  france  ireland  germany  all other eea states and certain latin american countries 
in addition  aspen uk is eligible to write surplus lines business in us jurisdictions 
we can give no assurance  however  that insurance regulators in the united states  bermuda or elsewhere will not review the activities of aspen uk and assess that aspen uk is subject to such jurisdiction s licensing or other requirements 

table of contents the bermudian regulatory system and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aspen bermuda is a registered class bermuda insurance and reinsurance company 
among other matters  bermuda statutes  regulations and policies of the bma require aspen bermuda to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  to meet solvency standards  to obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares in certain circumstances and to submit to certain periodic examinations of its financial condition 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict aspen bermuda s ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
with effect from december   the bma introduced a risk based capital adequacy model called the bscr for class insurers like aspen bermuda to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization 
the bma has published a number of consultation and discussion papers covering the following proposed regulatory changes which may or may not become adopted in present or revised form in the future the introduction  for solvency purposes  of an economic balance sheet to ensure that all assets and liabilities are valued on a consistent economic basis  enhancements to the disclosure and transparency regime by introducing a number of additional qualitative and quantitative public and regulatory disclosure requirements  and the introduction of own risk and solvency assessment which will require insurers to demonstrate the link between capital adequacy  risk governance process and strategic decision making 
the insurance laws or regulations of other jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aspen bermuda does not maintain a principal office  and its personnel do not solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other activities that may constitute the transaction of the business of insurance or reinsurance  in any jurisdiction in which it is not licensed or otherwise not authorized to engage in such activities 
although aspen bermuda does not believe it is or will be in violation of insurance laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to aspen bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities may still be raised in the future 
the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the united states and various states within the united states 
compliance with any new laws  regulations or settlements impacting offshore insurers or reinsurers  such as aspen bermuda  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
amal and aul 
amal is the managing agency and aul is the sole corporate member for our lloyd s platform  syndicate both entities are incorporated in the uk both the fsa and lloyd s have regulatory authority over amal and lloyd s has regulatory authority over aul 
both regulators have substantial powers in relation to the companies they regulate  including the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity or to continue as a member of lloyd s 
the failure of aaic to amend all of its licenses to write admitted business in the united states 
aaic has licenses to transact insurance in states and the district of columbia but before it can write the specific admitted business it seeks to transact in the united states  it must amend these licenses in certain states and complete form  rules and rate filings 
as at december   us states have granted full licensing authority to aaic 
however  if for any unforeseen reasons aaic is unable to amend the remaining licenses as required  aaic will be unable to transact business in all states and the district of columbia as intended 

table of contents the council of lloyd s and the lloyd s franchise board have wide discretionary powers to supervise members of lloyd s 
the council of lloyd s may  for instance  vary the method by which the capital requirement is determined  or the investment criteria applicable to funds at lloyd s 
the former restriction might affect the maximum amount of the overall premium income that we are able to underwrite and both might affect our return on investments 
the lloyd s franchise board also has wide discretionary powers in relation to the business of lloyd s managing agents  such as amal  including the requirement for compliance with the franchise performance and underwriting guidelines 
the lloyd s franchise board imposes certain restrictions on underwriting or on reinsurance arrangements for any lloyd s syndicate and changes in these requirements imposed on us may have an adverse impact on our ability to underwrite which in turn will have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
changes in lloyd s regulation or the lloyd s market could make syndicate less attractive 
changes in lloyd s regulation or other developments in the lloyd s market could make operating syndicate less attractive 
for example  lloyd s imposes a number of charges on businesses operating in the lloyd s market  including  for example  annual subscriptions and central fund levies for members and policy signing charges 
despite the principle that each member of lloyd s is only responsible for a proportion of risk written on his or her behalf  a central fund acts as a policyholders protection fund to make payments where other members have failed to pay valid claims 
the council of lloyd s may resolve to make payments from the central fund for the advancement and protection of members  which could lead to additional or special levies being payable by syndicate the bases and amounts of these charges may be varied by lloyd s and could adversely affect our financial and operating results 
syndicate may also be affected by a number of other changes in lloyd s regulation  such as changes to the process for the release of profits and new member compliance requirements 
the ability of lloyd s syndicates to trade in certain classes of business at current levels may be dependent on the maintenance by lloyd s of a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency 
at present  the financial security of the lloyd s market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies  am best  s p and fitch ratings 
see our insurance subsidiaries are rated  and our lloyd s business benefits from a rating by one or more of am best  s p and moody s  and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease  above 
the syndicate capital setting process within amal is also under the fsa rules but is delegated to lloyd s to deal with the detailed procedures 
lloyd s could request an increase in capital under the fsa rules in similar circumstances as set out above in the section on aspen uk as an eu based insurer  syndicate is also subject to the provisions of solvency ii as noted above 
us entities aspen specialty  aspen american insurance company  and affiliated producer entities 
aspen specialty is organized in and has received a license to write certain lines of insurance business in the state of north dakota and  as a result  is subject to north dakota law and regulation under the supervision of the ndci 
aaic is organized in texas and has licenses to write property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis in all states and the district of columbia 
these states also have regulatory authority over a number of affiliate transactions between the insurance companies and other members of our holding company system 
the purpose of the state insurance regulatory statutes is to protect us policyholders  not our shareholders or noteholders 
among other matters  state insurance regulations will require aspen entities to maintain minimum levels of capital  surplus and liquidity  require insurers to comply with applicable risk based capital requirements and will impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of aspen entities in the us to write new business or distribute assets to aspen holdings 

table of contents new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
along with our peers in the industry  we will continue to monitor such changes in existing laws and regulations and the possibility of a dual regulatory framework in the us in recent years  the us insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
in addition  the us congress has enacted legislation providing a greater role for the federal government in the regulation of insurance 
moreover  the naic and state insurance regulators regularly examine existing laws and regulations 
changes in federal or state laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as an example of such federal regulation  in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the world trade center tragedy  tria was enacted in to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the united states 
this law has been extended twice  and is currently scheduled to expire on december  tria established a federal assistance program to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and regulates the terms of insurance relating to terrorism coverage 
thus  for their direct insurance business  aspen specialty  aaic and aspen uk are required to offer terrorism coverage including both domestic and foreign terrorism  and have adjusted the pricing of tria coverage as appropriate to reflect the broader scope of coverage being provided 
similar federally sponsored mandatory programs may come into play in the near future for funding of catastrophic risk or other risks of loss in the public eye  with unknown impact to aspen 
on july   the dodd frank act became law in the us in addition to introducing sweeping reform of the us financial services industry  the dodd frank act introduces certain changes to us insurance regulation in general  and to non admitted insurance and reinsurance in particular 
the dodd frank act incorporates the nrra which will become effective on july  the nrra would establish national standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurers and also sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance 
in particular  the nrra gives regulators in an insured s home state authority over most aspects of surplus lines insurance  including the right to collect and allocate premium tax with respect to policies with multi state perils  and regulators in a reinsurer s state of domicile are given the sole responsibility for regulating the reinsurer s financial solvency 
the nrra also prohibits a state from denying credit for reinsurance if the domiciliary state of the insurer purchasing reinsurance recognizes credit for reinsurance 
at the present time  it appears the changes specific to non admitted insurance and reinsurance will likely have a positive effect for companies such as aspen specialty and aspen uk  although there is still significant uncertainty as to how these and other provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented in practice 
the dodd frank act also creates the federal insurance office fio within the department of treasury  designed to promote national coordination within the insurance sector and would have the authority  in part  to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry  including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the united states financial system 
the act also provides the fio  jointly with the secretary of the treasury and us trade representative  with the power to enter into agreements with foreign governments relating to the recognition of prudential measures for the business of insurance or reinsurance 
in entering into such agreements  the fio will have the authority to preempt state law if it is determined that a state law is inconsistent with the international agreement and treats a non us insurer less favorably than a non us insurer 
these measures could ultimately lead to regulation which could have a material financial impact on us 

table of contents changes in us state insurance legislation and insurance department legislation may impact on liabilities assumed by our business 
aspen specialty  aaic  aspen uk and various affiliates are subject to periodic changes in us state insurance legislation and insurance department regulation which may materially affect the liabilities assumed by the companies in such states 
for example  as a result of natural disasters  emergency orders and related regulations may be periodically issued or enacted by individual states 
this may impact the cancellation or non renewal of property policies issued in those states for an extended period of time  increasing the potential liability to the company on such extended policies 
failure to adhere to these regulations could result in the imposition of fines  fees  penalties and loss of approval to write business in such states 
certain states with catastrophe exposures eg  california earthquakes  florida hurricanes have opted to establish state run  state owned reinsurers that compete with us and our peers 
these entities tend to reduce the amount of business available to us 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
from time to time  we may need to hire additional employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits are granted or renewed by the bermuda department of immigration upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in april  the bermuda government announced a policy whereby unless a work permit holder is otherwise exempt  he or she will be limited to a maximum term of six years 
renewal beyond the general maximum of six years is possible if the employer makes a compelling case to justify it because of genuine and real need to renew the permit 
generally  no extensions will be permitted beyond a further three years bringing the maximum to nine years in total 
non bermudian employees who have been granted key status to aspen bermuda by the bermuda department of immigration have been granted an exemption from those term limits 
as of december   we had employees in bermuda 
julian cusack  the current group chief risk officer and chairman and ceo of aspen bermuda and james few  president  aspen re and chief underwriting officer of aspen bermuda are non bermudian who are working under work permits that will expire in march messrs 
cusack and few have been granted key worker status by the bermuda department of immigration and therefore term limits do not apply  however  key worker work permits still require renewal to remain valid 
even with an exemption from term limits  renewals of work permits are subject to approval by the bermuda department of immigration 
in this case  their work permits would only not be renewed in the event that a bermudian and or spouse of a bermudian is qualified to perform their duties 
none of our current non bermudian employees for whom we have applied for a work permit has been denied 
we could lose the services of messrs 
cusack or few or another key employee who is non bermudian if we were unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
from time to time  government authorities seek to more closely monitor and regulate the insurance industry  which may adversely affect our business 
the attorneys general for multiple states and other insurance regulatory authorities have previously investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry  and in particular insurance brokerage compensation practices 
to the extent that state regulation of brokers and intermediaries becomes more onerous  costs of regulatory compliance for aspen management  asis  aspen re america and ara ca will increase 
finally  to the extent that any of the brokers with whom we do business suffer financial difficulties as a result of the investigations or proceedings  we could suffer increased credit risk 
see our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk and since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of 
table of contents our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us above 
these investigations of the insurance industry in general  whether involving the company specifically or not  together with any legal or regulatory proceedings  related settlements and industry reform or other changes arising therefrom  may materially adversely affect our business and future financial results or results of operations 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that are more difficult than those made in a more mature company because we have more limited historical information through december  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  impairments  income taxes  contingencies  derivatives and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like us  are more difficult to make than those made for a more mature company because we have more limited historical information through december  a significant part of our current loss reserves is in respect of ibnr 
this ibnr reserve is based almost entirely on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs 
in addition to limited historical information  we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish loss reserves 
accordingly  actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
other operational risks the loss of underwriters or underwriting teams could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend in substantial part  upon our ability to attract and retain our teams of underwriters in various business lines 
although we are not aware of any planned departures  the loss of one or more of our senior underwriters could adversely impact our business by  for example  making it more difficult to retain clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing personnel 
in addition  the loss of services of underwriters could strain our ability to execute our new business lines  as described elsewhere in this report 
in general  the loss of key services of any members of our current underwriting teams may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more principal employees or by an inability to attract and retain senior staff 
our success will depend in substantial part upon our ability to retain our principal employees and to attract additional employees 
we rely substantially upon the services of our senior management team 
although we have employment agreements with all of the members of our senior management team  if we were to unexpectedly lose the services of members of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 

table of contents changes in employment laws  taxation and acceptable remuneration practice may limit our ability to attract senior employees to our current operating platforms 
our insurance and reinsurance operations are  by their nature  international and we compete for senior employees on a global basis 
changes in employment legislation  taxation and the approach of regulatory bodies to remuneration practice within our operating jurisdictions may impact our ability to recruit or retain senior employees or the cost to us of doing so 
any failure to retain senior employees may adversely affect the strategic growth of our business and the results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by action taken against us by former employers of our staff who allege that their former employees may be in breach of legal obligations to them 
within our industry it is common for employers to seek to restrict an employee s ability either to work for a competitor or to engage in business activities with the customers or staff of a former employer after leaving employment 
in addition  our employees may owe statutory or fiduciary obligations to former employers 
the extent of any such post termination restrictions and the extent to which any alleged contractual restrictions are enforceable is highly fact specific and dependant upon the local laws in the applicable jurisdiction in any case 
action taken by former employers to enforce such restrictions  however  even if ultimately found not to be legally binding  may adversely affect our ability to pursue current business objectives 
we rely on third party service providers for some of our operations and systems 
we rely on third party service providers for a variety of services and systems  which include but are not limited to  claims handling activity  support on our underwriting and finance systems  investment management and catastrophe modeling 
if our third party service providers fail to perform as expected  it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
risks related to our ordinary shares future sales of ordinary shares may affect their market price and the future exercise of options may result in immediate and substantial dilution 
as of december   there were  ordinary shares outstanding 
of these shares  most are freely transferable  except for any shares sold to our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act 
moreover  as of december   an additional  ordinary shares were issuable upon the full exercise on a cash basis of outstanding options by appleby services bermuda ltd  formerly appleby bermuda trust limited the names trustee  as successor trustee of the names trust  which holds the options and shares for the benefit of the members of syndicate who were not corporate members of wellington underwriting agencies limited wual 
the names trustee may exercise its options on a cashless basis  which allows it to realize the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the options and the then prevailing market price without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares in cash 
thus  the option holder receives fewer shares upon exercise 
this cashless exercise feature may provide an incentive for the names trustee to exercise their options more quickly 
in the event that the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares are exercised  you will suffer immediate dilution of your investment 
in addition  we have filed registration statements on form s under the securities act to register ordinary shares issued or reserved for issuance under our share incentive plan  our non employee director plan  our employee share purchase plan and our sharesave scheme 
subject to the exercise of issued and outstanding options  shares registered under the registration statement on form s may be available for sale into the public markets 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future sales of our ordinary shares  or the availability of ordinary shares for future sale  will have on the market price of our ordinary shares 
sales of substantial 
table of contents amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares 
furthermore  on december   we issued  perpetual income equity replacement security the perpetual piers 
each perpetual piers will be convertible  at the option of the holder thereof  into one perpetual preference share and a number of our ordinary shares  if any  based on an initial conversion rate of ordinary shares per liquidation preference of perpetual piers  subject to specified adjustments 
in addition  at any time on or after january   under certain circumstances  we may  at our option  cause each perpetual piers to be automatically converted into in cash and ordinary shares  if any 
the conversion of some or all of our perpetual piers will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders 
any sales in the public market of our ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ordinary shares 
in addition  the existence of our perpetual piers may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our perpetual piers could depress the price of our ordinary shares 
there are provisions in our charter documents which may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
in general  and except as provided below  shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  if  and so long as  the ordinary shares of a shareholder are treated as controlled shares as determined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code of any us person as defined below and such controlled shares constitute or more of the votes conferred by our issued shares  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such us person a us shareholder shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than  under a formula specified in our bye laws 
the formula is applied repeatedly until the voting power of all us shareholders has been reduced to less than 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s voting rights including appointment rights  if any  granted to holders of our perpetual piers or to holders of our perpetual non cumulative preference shares liquidation preference per share the perpetual preference shares where it deems it appropriate to do so to i avoid the existence of any us shareholder  and ii avoid certain material adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or any holder of our shares or its affiliates 
controlled shares includes  among other things  all shares of the company that such us person is deemed to own directly  indirectly or constructively within the meaning of section of the code 
as of december   there were  ordinary shares outstanding of which  ordinary shares would constitute of the votes conferred by our issued and outstanding shares 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation  or entity treated as a corporation  created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  or iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes or z any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
see part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchaser of equity securities bye laws 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
our bye laws provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by them 

table of contents as a result of any reallocation of votes  voting rights of some of our shareholders might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in such shareholders becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of the votes of our shareholders could result in some of the shareholders becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act in the event that the company no longer qualifies as a foreign private issuer 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated under the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate such shareholder s voting rights 
there are provisions in our bye laws which may restrict the ability to transfer ordinary shares and which may require shareholders to sell their ordinary shares 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if it appears to the board of directors  in their sole and reasonable discretion  after taking into account the limitations on voting rights contained in our bye laws  that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders or their affiliates may occur as a result of such transfer 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in material adverse tax consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any shareholder or its affiliates  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair market value the minimum number of ordinary shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the material adverse tax consequences 
laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we conduct business could delay or deter a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be desirable and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and have the effect of entrenching management  and your ability to purchase more than of our voting shares will be restricted 
ordinary shares may be offered or sold in bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the investment business act of bermuda which regulates the sale of securities in bermuda 
in addition  the bma must approve all issuances and transfers of shares of a bermuda exempted company other than in cases where the bma has granted a general permission 
the bma in its policy dated june  provides that where any equity securities of a bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange  general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of the securities of the company from and or to a non resident of bermuda  for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed 
notwithstanding the above general permission  we have obtained from the bma their permission for the issue and free transferability of the ordinary shares in the company  as long as the shares are listed on the new york stock exchange the nyse which is an appointed stock exchange or other appointed stock exchange  to and among persons who are non residents of bermuda for exchange control purposes and of up to of the ordinary shares to and among persons who are residents in bermuda for exchange control purposes 
the bma and the registrar of companies accept no responsibility for the financial soundness of any proposal or for the correctness of any of the statements made or opinions expressed in this report 
under the insurance act  each shareholder or prospective shareholder will be responsible for notifying the bma in writing of his becoming a controller  directly or indirectly  of   or of aspen holdings and ultimately aspen bermuda within days of becoming such a controller

table of contents the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company or lloyd s managing agent which are authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares of a uk authorized insurance company or lloyd s managing agent  or their parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or lloyd s managing agent or their parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or lloyd s managing agent or their parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of aspen uk or amal 
under fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must notify the fsa of his intention to do so and obtain the fsa s prior approval 
the fsa would then have sixty working days to consider that person s application to acquire control 
in considering whether to approve such application  the fsa must be satisfied both that the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application would constitute a criminal offense 
a person who is already deemed to have control will require prior approval of the fsa if such person increases their level of control beyond certain percentages 
these percentages are  and 
additionally  as we are the holding company of amal and aul and since lloyd s supervises amal and aul  the prior consent of lloyd s is required for any acquisition of control  as defined above  of amal and aul 
under the north dakota insurance and texas holding company statutes  if a holder would acquire beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding voting securities without the prior approval of the north dakota and texas insurance departments  then our north dakota and texas insurance subsidiaries or the north dakota and texas insurance departments are entitled to injunctive relief  including enjoining any proposed acquisition  or seizing ordinary shares owned by any person who has acquired control without prior approval  and such ordinary shares would not be entitled to be voted 
there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned greater than of our ordinary shares did not  because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares  control the applicable insurance subsidiary 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 
if these restrictions delay  deter or prevent a change of control  such restrictions may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance

us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to us  differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the companies act which includes  where relevant  information on modifications thereto adopted under our bye laws  applicable to us  which differ in certain respects from provisions of delaware corporate law which is representative of the corporate law of the various states comprising the united states 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not discuss all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders 
interested directors 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  a transaction entered into by us  in which a director has an interest  will not be voidable by us  and such director will not be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction  provided the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors  or in writing  to the directors 
in addition  our bye laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which that director has an interest following a declaration of the interest under the companies act  unless the majority of the disinterested directors determine otherwise 
under delaware law  the transaction would not be voidable if the material facts as to the interested director s relationship or interests were disclosed or were known to the board of directors and the board of directors in good faith authorized the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  the material facts were disclosed or were known to the shareholders entitled to vote on such transaction and the transaction was specifically approved in good faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to vote thereon  or the transaction was fair as to the corporation at the time it was authorized  approved or ratified 
business combinations with large shareholders or affiliates 
as a bermuda company  we may enter into business combinations with our large shareholders or one or more wholly owned subsidiaries  including asset sales and other transactions in which a large shareholder or a wholly owned subsidiary receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders or other wholly owned subsidiaries  without obtaining prior approval from our shareholders and without special approval from our board of directors 
under bermuda law  amalgamations require the approval of the board of directors  and except in the case of amalgamations with and between wholly owned subsidiaries  shareholder approval 
however  when the affairs of a bermuda company are being conducted in a manner which is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders  one or more shareholders may apply to a bermuda court  which may make an order as it sees fit  including an order regulating the conduct of the company s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or the company 
if we were a delaware company  we would need prior approval from our board of directors or a supermajority of our shareholders to enter 
table of contents into a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder  unless we opted out of the relevant delaware statute 
bermuda law or our bye laws would require board of directors approval and  in some instances  shareholder approval of such transactions 
shareholders suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to commence a derivative action in our name to remedy a wrong done to us where an act is alleged to be beyond our corporate power  is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
our bye laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director s or officer s duties  except with respect to any fraud or dishonesty of the director or officer or to recover any gain  personal profit or advantage to which the director or officer is not legally entitled 
class actions and derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under delaware law for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in such actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
indemnification of directors and officers 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  we may indemnify our directors  officers  any other person appointed to a committee of the board of directors or resident representative and their respective heirs  executors or administrators to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense  incurred or suffered by such persons by reason of any act done  conceived in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of their duties  provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter which would render such indemnification void under the companies act 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against expenses including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in defense of an action  suit or proceeding by reason of such position if i such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and ii with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors  which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares 
our bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
for example  our bye laws contain the following provisions that could have such an effect election of directors is staggered  meaning that members of only one of three classes of directors are elected each year  directors serve for a term of three years unless years or older  
table of contents our directors may decline to approve or register any transfer of shares to the extent they determine  in their sole discretion  that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to aspen holdings  any of its subsidiaries  shareholders or affiliates would result from such transfer  if our directors determine that share ownership by any person may result in material adverse tax consequences to aspen holdings  any of its subsidiaries  shareholders or affiliates  we have the option  but not the obligation  to purchase or assign to a third party the right to purchase the minimum number of shares held by such person solely to the extent that it is necessary to eliminate such material risk  shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  and if the ordinary shares of any us person constitute or more of the votes conferred by the issued shares of aspen holdings  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such us person shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than we are a bermuda company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  certain of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as such  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we have been advised by bermuda counsel that there is no treaty in force between the us and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a us judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a us court that is final and for a sum certain based on us federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the us court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda not us law 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a us federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
it is the advice of our bermuda counsel that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 

table of contents risks related to taxation our non us companies other than aul may be subject to non us tax and that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment 
if aspen holdings or any of its non us subsidiaries other than aul were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business  in which case its results of operations could be materially adversely affected although its results of operations should not be materially adversely affected if aspen uk is considered to be engaged in a us trade or business solely as a result of the binding authorities granted to aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen management  aspen solutions and wellington underwriting inc wu inc 
aspen holdings  aspen bermuda  and acorn limited are bermuda companies  aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services are uk companies and apj jersey is a jersey company 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies other than aul will operate in such a manner that none of these companies should be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on certain us source investment income  and the likely imposition of us corporate income and additional branch profits tax on the profits attributable to the business of aspen uk produced pursuant to the binding authorities granted to aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen solutions and aspen management  as well as the binding authorities previously granted to wu inc because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states other than aspen uk with respect to the business produced pursuant to the aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen management and prior wu inc binding authorities agreements 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that some or all of aspen holdings or its non us subsidiaries other than aul is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states based on activities in addition to the binding authorities discussed above 
aul is a member of lloyd s and subject to a closing agreement between lloyd s and the irs the closing agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the closing agreement all members of lloyd s  including aul  are subject to us federal income taxation 
those members that are entitled to the benefits of a us income tax treaty are deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business through a us permanent establishment 
those members not entitled to the benefits of such a treaty are merely deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business 
the closing agreement provides rules for determining the income considered to be attributable to the permanent establishment or us trade or business 
we believe that aul may be entitled to the benefits of the us income tax treaty with the uk the uk treaty  although the position is not certain 
our non uk companies may be subject to non uk tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
none of us  except for aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  is incorporated in the united kingdom 
accordingly  none of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  should be treated as being resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes unless our central management and control is exercised in the united kingdom 
the concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company  which is wholly a question of fact 
each of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  currently intends to manage our affairs so that none of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  is resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes 

table of contents a company not resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes can nevertheless be subject to uk corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom but the charge to uk corporation tax is limited to profits including revenue profits and capital gains attributable directly or indirectly to such permanent establishment 
each of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  which should be treated as resident in the united kingdom by virtue of being incorporated and managed there  currently intends that we will operate in such a manner so that none of us other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statute definitively defines the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  her majesty s revenue and customs might contend successfully that any of us other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services are is trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment 
the united kingdom has no income tax treaty with bermuda 
there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the united kingdom nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a permanent establishment but each of us intends that we will operate in such a manner that none of us will fall within the charge to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding in this respect 
if any of us  other than aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services were treated as being resident in the united kingdom for uk corporation tax purposes  or if any of us were to be treated as carrying on a trade in the united kingdom  whether or not through a permanent establishment  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our uk operations may be affected by future changes in uk tax law 
aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj and apj services  should be treated as resident in the united kingdom by virtue of being incorporated and managed there and accordingly be subject to uk tax in respect of their worldwide income and gains 
any change in the basis or rate of uk corporation tax could materially adversely affect the operations of the uk companies 
the taxation international and other provisions act contains a restriction on the deductibility of interest costs in computing taxable profits of companies for uk tax purposes  known as the worldwide debt cap  which applies to accounting periods beginning on or after january  broadly  uk tax deductions for the net finance expense of the uk companies in a group are restricted by reference to if less the amount of the gross consolidated finance expense of the worldwide group 
however  there is an exemption from the worldwide debt cap  if all or substantially all of either the uk trading income or the worldwide trading income of the group is derived from the effecting or carrying out of insurance contracts  or investment business arising directly from such insurance activities 
on the basis of the current business activities of the aspen group  we consider that this exemption should apply 
however  any disallowance of interest costs in computing taxable profits for uk tax purposes could adversely affect the tax charge to which the aspen group is subject 
consultation is ongoing with regard to changes to the uk controlled foreign company rules 
in november  the uk government published the details of the new proposed regime and draft legislation  with a view to legislating in the finance bill in respect of the proposed interim improvements to the controlled foreign company rules and announced its intention to further legislate in 
table of contents the finance bill 
any changes to the uk controlled foreign company rules might affect the uk resident entities of the aspen group 
our uk operations may be adversely affected by a transfer pricing adjustment in computing uk taxable profits 
any arrangements between uk resident entities of the aspen group and other members of the aspen group are subject to the uk transfer pricing regime 
consequently  if any agreement including any reinsurance agreements between a uk resident entity of the aspen group and any other aspen group entity whether that entity is resident in or outside the uk is found not to be on arm s length terms and as a result a uk tax advantage is being obtained  an adjustment will be required to compute uk taxable profits as if such an agreement were on arm s length terms 
any transfer pricing adjustment could adversely impact the tax charge suffered by the relevant uk resident entities of the aspen group 
holders of or more of aspen holdings shares may be subject to us income taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
if you are a us shareholder defined as a us person as defined below who owns directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively as defined below at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a non us corporation  that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and you own shares in the non u 
s corporation directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the non us corporation s taxable year on which it is a cfc  you must include in your gross income for us federal income tax purposes your pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a non us insurance corporation typically includes non us personal holding company income such as interest  dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment income 
a non us corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through non us entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of that non us corporation  or the total value of all stock of that non us corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a non us insurance company earning insurance income in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts other than certain insurance or reinsurance related to some country risks written by certain insurance companies  not applicable here exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or organized under the laws of any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes and v any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
we believe that because of the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership  provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power these provisions are described under bye laws in part ii  item below and other factors  no us person who owns shares of aspen holdings directly or indirectly through one or more non us entities should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through non us entities  or constructively or more of the total voting power of all classes of shares of 
table of contents aspen holdings or any of its non us subsidiaries 
it is possible  however  that the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions 
us persons who hold our shares may be subject to us income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our related party insurance income rpii 
if the rpii determined on a gross basis of any of our non us insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed of that company s gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to those insureds own directly or indirectly through entities or more of the voting power or value of aspen holdings  then a us person who owns any shares of such non us insurance subsidiary directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the taxable year on which it is an rpii cfc would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes such person s pro rata share of such company s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to us persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
the amount of rpii earned by a non us insurance subsidiary generally  premium and related investment income from the indirect or direct insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect us holder of shares or any person related to such holder will depend on a number of factors  including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by the company 
we believe that the direct or indirect insureds of each of our non us insurance subsidiaries and related persons did not directly or indirectly own or more of either the voting power or value of our shares in prior years of operation and we do not expect this to be the case in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we do not expect gross rpii of each of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to equal or exceed of its gross insurance income in any taxable year for the foreseeable future  but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of rpii may be beyond our control 
us persons who dispose of our shares may be subject to us federal income taxation at the rates applicable to dividends on a portion of such disposition 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  in conjunction with the rpii rules provides that if a us person disposes of shares in a non us corporation that earns insurance income in which us persons own or more of the shares even if the amount of gross rpii is less than of the corporation s gross insurance income and the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the threshold  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a holder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the holder 
these rpii rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because aspen holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have never been interpreted by the courts or the treasury department in final regulations  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts  or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
the treasury department has authority to impose  among other things  additional reporting requirements with respect to rpii 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and the application thereof to us is uncertain 

table of contents us persons who hold our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
if we are considered a pfic for us federal income tax purposes  a us person who owns any of our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we were considered a pfic  upon the death of any us individual owning shares  such individual s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a step up in the basis of the shares that might otherwise be available under us federal income tax laws 
we believe that we are not  have not been  and currently do not expect to become  a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be deemed a pfic by the irs 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 
us tax exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income 
a us tax exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of the insurance income of any of our non us insurance subsidiaries is allocated to the organization  which generally would be the case if any of our non us insurance subsidiaries is a cfc and the tax exempt shareholder is a us shareholder or there is rpii  certain exceptions do not apply and the tax exempt organization owns any of our shares 
although we do not believe that any us persons should be allocated such insurance income  we cannot be certain that this will be the case 
us tax exempt investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors 
scope of application of recently enacted legislation is uncertain 
the us congress enacted legislation in that would require our non us companies to enter into agreements with the irs that would require our non us companies  if characterized as foreign financial institutions  to obtain information about our noteholders and shareholders and to disclose information about our us noteholders and shareholders to the irs and would appear to impose a withholding tax on certain payments of us source income to our us companies if they do not enter into the agreement  are unable to obtain information about our us noteholders and shareholders or otherwise fails to satisfy the obligations under the agreement 
additionally  if our non us companies are characterized as a foreign financial institution and do enter into such an agreement with the irs  a withholding tax could be imposed on noteholders and shareholders that do not provide the required information 
if our non us companies are characterized as a foreign financial institution and cannot satisfy these obligations  payments of us source income made after december  on obligations not outstanding on march  to our non us companies or  in the case of a company that enters into the appropriate agreement with the irs  payments by our non us companies related to such non us source income to noteholders or shareholders that do not provide the required information after this date will be subject to such withholding tax under the legislation 
as a result  noteholders and shareholders may be required to provide any information that our non us companies determines necessary to avoid the imposition of such withholding tax in order to allow our non us companies to satisfy such obligations 
further  if our non us companies are not characterized as foreign financial institutions  they would appear to be subject to such withholding tax on certain payments of us source income unless they either provide information to withholding agents with respect to our substantial us owners or make certain certifications 
companion provisions may require individual shareholders to annually report with their us federal income tax returns certain information with respect to our non us companies specified foreign financial assets 
the us treasury is expected to 
table of contents issue regulations clarifying the scope of this legislation 
for these purposes  a foreign financial institution is generally a non us entity that i accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business  ii holds financial assets for the accounts of others as a substantial portion of its business or iii is engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  or trading in securities  partnership interests  commodities  or any interest in such securities  partnership interests or commodities 
potential fbar reporting and reporting of specified foreign financial assets 
us persons holding our shares and us persons holding our shares that are in and doing business in the united states should consider their possible obligation to file a irs form td f foreign bank and financial accounts report with respect to their shares 
additionally  such us and us persons should consider their possible obligations to annually report certain information with respect to us with their us federal income tax returns 
shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirement which may apply with respect to their ownership of our shares 
changes in us federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our shares 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
for example  legislation has been introduced in congress to limit the deductibility of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to non us affiliates  which  if enacted  could adversely impact our results 
further  the us federal income tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a trade or business within the united states  or is a pfic  or whether us persons would be required to include in their gross income the subpart f income or the rpii of a cfc are subject to change  possibly on a retroactive basis 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic rules to insurance companies and the regulations regarding rpii are still in proposed form 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot be certain if  when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd  has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s progress report dated april   bermuda was designated as an oecd white list jurisdiction that has substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standards 
the standards for the oecd compliance are to have at least signed tax information exchange agreements tieas with other oecd members or non oecd members 
as of december   bermuda had signed tieas which exceed the requisite amount  demonstrating the bermuda government s commitment to preserve the standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes

item legal proceedings in common with the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry  we are also subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of our business 
our insurance subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the investigation  conduct and defense of disputes  or potential disputes  resulting from questions of insurance or reinsurance coverage or claims activities 
pursuant to our insurance and reinsurance arrangements  many of these disputes are resolved by arbitration or other forms of alternative dispute resolution 
in some jurisdictions  noticeably the us  a failure to deal with such disputes or potential disputes in an appropriate manner could result in an award of bad faith punitive damages against our insurance subsidiaries 
while any legal or arbitration proceedings contain an element of uncertainty  we do not believe that the eventual outcome of any specific litigation  arbitration or alternative dispute resolution proceedings to which we are currently a party will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of or business as a whole

bye laws our board of directors approved amendments to our bye laws on march   february   february  and february   which were subsequently approved by our shareholders at our annual general meetings on may   may   april  and april  respectively 
below is a description of our bye laws as amended 
our board of directors and corporate action 
our bye laws provide that the board of directors shall consist of not less than six and not more than directors 
subject to our bye laws and bermuda law  the directors shall be elected or appointed by holders of ordinary shares 
our board of directors is divided into three classes  designated class i  class ii and class iii and is elected by the shareholders as follows 
our class i directors are elected to serve until the annual general meeting  our class ii directors are elected to serve until the annual general meeting and our class iii directors are elected to serve until our annual general meeting 
notwithstanding the foregoing  directors who are 
table of contents years or older shall be elected every year and shall not be subject to a three year term 
in addition  notwithstanding the foregoing  each director shall hold office until such director s successor shall have been duly elected or until such director is removed from office or such office is otherwise vacated 
in the event of any change in the number of directors  the board of directors shall apportion any newly created directorships among  or reduce the number of directorships in  such class or classes as shall equalize  as nearly as possible  the number of directors in each class 
in no event will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director 
generally  the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be required to authorize corporate action 
corporate action may also be taken by a unanimous written resolution of the board of directors without a meeting and with no need to give notice  except in the case of removal of auditors or directors 
the quorum necessary for the transaction of business of the board of directors may be fixed by the board of directors and  unless so fixed at any other number  shall be a majority of directors in office from time to time and in no event less than two directors 
voting cutbacks 
in general  and except as provided below  shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  if  and so long as  the shares of a shareholder in the company are treated as controlled shares as determined pursuant to section of the code of any us person and such controlled shares constitute or more of the votes conferred by the issued shares of aspen holdings  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares owned by such us person shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than  under a formula specified in our bye laws 
the formula is applied repeatedly until the voting power of all us shareholders has been reduced to less than 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s voting rights when it deems it appropriate to do so to i avoid the existence of any us shareholder  and ii avoid certain material adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to the company or any of its subsidiaries or any shareholder or its affiliates 
controlled shares includes  among other things  all shares of the company that such us person is deemed to own directly  indirectly or constructively within the meaning of section of the code 
the amount of any reduction of votes that occurs by operation of the above limitations will generally be reallocated proportionately among all other shareholders of aspen holdings whose shares were not controlled shares of the us shareholder so long as such i reallocation does not cause any person to become a us shareholder and provided further that  ii no portion of such reallocation shall apply to the shares held by wellington or the names trustee  except where the failure to apply such increase would result in any person becoming a shareholder  and iii reallocation shall be limited in the case of existing shareholders i  phoenix and montpelier reinsurance limited so that none of their voting rights exceed no longer relevant as they are not shareholders of the company any longer 
the references in the previous sentence to wellington  i  phoenix and montpelier reinsurance limited are no longer relevant as they are no longer shareholders of the company 
these voting cut back provisions have been incorporated into the company s bye laws to seek to mitigate the risk of any us person that owns our ordinary shares directly or indirectly through non us entities being characterized as a us shareholders for purposes of the us controlled foreign corporation rules 
if such a direct or indirect us shareholder of the company were characterized as us shareholder of the company and the company or one of its subsidiaries were characterized as a cfc  such shareholder might have to include its pro rata share of the company income subject to certain exceptions in its us federal gross income  even if there have been no distributions to the us shareholders by the company 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
our bye 
table of contents laws provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by them 
we are authorized to require any shareholder to provide information as to that shareholder s beneficial share ownership  the names of persons having beneficial ownership of the shareholder s shares  relationships with other shareholders or any other facts the directors may deem relevant to a determination of the number of ordinary shares attributable to any person 
if any holder fails to respond to this request or submits incomplete or inaccurate information  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
all information provided by the shareholder shall be treated by the company as confidential information and shall be used by the company solely for the purpose of establishing whether any us shareholder exists except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation 
shareholder action

the following actions shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least sixty six percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders in each case  after taking into account voting power adjustments under the bye laws i a merger or amalgamation with  or a sale  lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to a third party  where any shareholder does not have the same right to receive the same consideration as all other shareholders in such transaction  or ii discontinuance of the company out of bermuda to another jurisdiction 
in addition  any amendment to bye law shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least sixty six percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders after taking into account voting power adjustments under the bye laws

amendment

subject to the provisions of the bye laws  any of our shares held as treasury shares shall be at the disposal of the board  which may hold all or any of the shares  dispose of or transfer all or any of the shares for cash or other consideration  or cancel all or any of the shares 
corporate purpose 
our certificate of incorporation  memorandum of association and our bye laws do not restrict our corporate purpose and objects 
investor options upon our formation in june  we issued to the names trustee  as trustee of the names trust for the benefit of the unaligned members of syndicate the unaligned members  options to purchase  non voting shares the names options 
all non voting shares issued or to be issued upon the exercise of the names options will automatically convert into ordinary shares at a one to one ratio upon issuance 
as of february   the names trustee held  names options 
the rights of the holders of the names options are governed by an option instrument dated june   which was amended and restated on december  and further amended and restated on september   to effect certain of the provisions described below the option instrument 
the term of the names options expires on june  the names options may be exercised in whole or in part 
the names options are exercisable without regard to a minimum number of options to be exercised  at a sale as defined in the option instrument and on a monthly basis beginning in october expiring june  unless earlier lapsed following notification by the unaligned members to the names trustee of their elections to exercise the names options 
the names options will lapse on the earlier occurrence of i the end of the term of the investor options  ii the liquidation of the company other than a liquidation in connection with a reconstruction or amalgamation or iii the completion of a sale if such options are not exercised in connection with such sale 
the exercise price payable for each option share is  together with interest accruing at per annum less any dividends or other distributions from the date of issue of the names options june  until the date of exercise of the names options 
the exercise price per option as at february   was approximately 
each optionholder may exercise its options on a cashless basis  subject to relevant requirements of the companies act 
a cashless exercise allows the optionholders to realize  through the receipt of ordinary shares  the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the names options and the then prevailing market prices without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares 
as a result  the optionholder receives fewer shares upon exercise 
for any exercise of the names options on a cashless basis  the number of ordinary shares to be issued would be based on the difference between the exercise price on the date of exercise and the then prevailing market price of the ordinary shares  calculated using the average closing price for five preceding trading days 
following the issuance of the names options  there are a range of anti dilution protections for the optionholders if any issuance or reclassification of our shares or similar matters are effected below fair market value  subject to certain exceptions 
under these circumstances  an adjustment to the subscription rights of the optionholders or the subscription price of the names options shall be made by our board
