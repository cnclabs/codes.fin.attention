management overview the company continued to face a challenging retail environment in fiscal  as the economic landscape remained unsettled and consumers remained cautious 
our business continued to be negatively affected  which resulted in decreased sales for the company in fiscal we were disappointed in our operating results  as the macroeconomic environment impacted our results for fiscal we added key executives to the organization  in late and early  within the design  merchandising and production areas 
with these strategic changes to our organization  we intend to improve both our merchandise and overall performance  while placing cache in a more competitive position with other specialty retailers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million against the remaining carrying value of goodwill for its avd reporting unit  coupled with an impairment charge of approximately  for underperforming stores

the goal was to create a modern  feminine and inviting place for our customers to shop  while showcasing our merchandise in an appealing manner 
our new cash wrap area combines both modern 
table of contents and traditional elements and our new fitting room design creates a more feminine and glamorous environment for our customers 
the new prototype includes fixtures that allow for flexibility in displaying merchandise  as well as ease of shopping

we will utilize this new prototype for future store openings  as well as for major remodeling to existing stores 
we currently do not anticipate opening any new cache stores in fiscal and plan to remodel approximately five stores

first quarter outlook 
we believe that our merchandising and design strategies  which were implemented during the past year  are beginning to positively impact our performance and will be reflected in the first quarter results 
we expect our first quarter fiscal comparable store sales to increase approximately  following a decline in the first quarter of fiscal at the same time  we are expecting an increase in gross profit primarily due to higher sales and a decrease in markdowns 
we expect to report a net loss in the range of to per diluted share compared to a net loss of per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance of our business  some of which are set forth in the following table weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended january  january  december  operating results total store count  at end of period net sales decrease comparable store sales decrease net sales per square foot total square footage in thousands net sales 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed 
comparable stores sales percentages shown in the chart above are calculated based upon the number of weeks in the respective fiscal year 
the company co branded customer credit card program  which was introduced during fiscal  entitles the company to receive from the issuing bank a non refundable credit card activation fee for each new account that is opened and activated 
these fees are initially deferred and recognized in consolidated net sales as revenue over the life of the contract

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies and estimates which are described below 
inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
inventories other than finished goods at retail stores  called production inventory  primarily consists of piece goods  trim and work in process 
it is the company policy to value the production inventory  which makes up approximately of company total inventory  at lower of cost or market value using first in first out valuation method 
the company reviews the inventory for factors such as age  obsolescence  potential use  or other factors that may indicate a decline in its value 
the company records a reserve against the cost of the production inventory to account for any decline in its value 

table of contents finite long lived assets 
the company judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds the fair market value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
the company evaluates finite lived assets in accordance with impairment or disposal of long lived assets under topic property  plant and equipment of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc 
finite lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with topic of the fasb asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset is recognized 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
the company evaluated its finite lived assets during fiscal  and and as a result  recorded an impairment charge of  for underperforming stores  million for underperforming stores and million for underperforming stores  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other  topic of the fasb asc 
this guidance requires ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill impairment 
the company performs impairment testing  which considers the company fair value to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets  associated with its avd reporting unit  is necessary 
this is reevaluated annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if necessary 
the company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the recorded goodwill will be recoverable 
factors used to make this determination primarily include declines in stock price and the market capitalization in relation to the book value of the company  discounted projected cash flows of the reporting unit and valuation of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
as a result of this testing  an impairment charge of million was recorded against the remaining carrying value of goodwill during fiscal comparatively  during fiscal  the company did not incur an impairment charge against the carrying value of goodwill 
an impairment charge of  was recorded against the carrying value of intangible assets associated with its wholesale division mary l  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  related to the discontinuance of mary l

losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance 
table of contents industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan 
gift cards  gift certificates and credits 
the company sells gift cards and gift certificates gift cards and issues credits to its customers when merchandise is returned merchandise credit  which do not expire 
the company recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer and income when the likelihood of the gift card and merchandise credit being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage  since the company has determined that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed value to the relevant jurisdiction as abandoned property 
the company determines gift card breakage income based upon historical redemption patterns and the remaining unredeemed percentage at the end of our historical data of years 
historical redemptions of merchandise credits ranged from in the first quarter to in the fourteenth quarter subsequent to the issue date  resulting in an average of approximately redeemed or unredeemed merchandise credits over the historical data of years 
we have determined that redemption would be remote based on the fact that  by the fourteenth quarter since issue date  the redemption rate approximated  indicating that the probability of such cards being redeemed is remote 
as such  we have recorded breakage income based upon this  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis for propriety 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards and merchandise credit  for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer  is remote 
at that time  the company will recognize breakage income for those gift cards and merchandise credit 
the company recorded breakage income of   and  during fiscal year ended  and  respectively

income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income taxes  topic of the fasb asc 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when tax contingencies become probable  a liability for the contingent amount is estimated based upon the company best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions  as well as various tax filing positions 
as of january   the company had recorded a  reserve  net of federal benefit for potential tax contingencies 
comparatively  the company had recorded reserves of  and  net of federal benefit for potential tax contingencies  for fiscal periods ended january  and december   respectively 
during fiscal  and  the company generated federal net operating losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at january   the company had a federal net operating loss nol carry forward of million available  for carry forward for the next years  through the losses generated in both fiscal and were carried back to offset taxable income generated in fiscal and in assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  and projected taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the company current or previous losses are given more weight than its projected future performance 
consequently  based on our evaluation of all available evidence  in particular our recent operating losses  we established a federal valuation allowance of million at january  for state income tax purposes  the company has established a valuation allowance in the amount of  in fiscal  primarily to reserve for the possible non utilization of state nol carry forwards  which may not be realized in future periods before the nols expire 
the company increased the state valuation allowance at january  to  the company state nols expire from through the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with topic of the fasb asc  which prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the provision also states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 
table of contents a likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of this adoption did not result in any adjustment in the company liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions for prior years reductions for tax positions for prior years due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations settlements balance at january  included in the above ending balance are tax positions of  which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate 
the company continuing practice is to include estimated interest and penalties  if any  in computing the amount that is recognized within income tax expense relating to uncertain income tax positions 
as of january   the company had accrued  of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  which is included in the  tax contingency noted above 
although the company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the company accrued position 
accordingly  the company provisions on federal  state and local tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change  as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
as of january   the company does not believe that its estimates  as otherwise provided for  on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax  as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the company had previously reached agreement with the irs and closed the audit of fiscal year  with no change to the tax return 
the internal revenue service is currently examining the carry back claims form for the losses incurred in fiscal and  which were carried back against taxable income recorded in fiscal and the examination is under the auspices of the joint committee on taxation due to the size of the tax refund 
the company does not expect that any adjustments shall be made to the tax refunds received 
as for state and local income taxes  with few exceptions  the company is subject to state and local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years after stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards program  including grants of stock options  is recorded in accordance with compensation stock compensation  topic of the fasb asc 
the grant date fair value for stock options is calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility and the expected dividends 
all employee stock options were granted at or above the grant date market price 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
in accordance with the stated guidance  if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
the company recognized   and  in share based compensation expense during fiscal  and  respectively
