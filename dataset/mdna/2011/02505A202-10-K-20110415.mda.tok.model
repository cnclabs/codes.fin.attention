item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect the company s plans  estimates and beliefs 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
the company s consolidated audited financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
going concern the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve month period following the date of such consolidated financial statements 
the company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to effect its business plan and generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its daily operations  as well as to provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis 
the company anticipates making additional sales of equity securities 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales of additional equity securities or that such funding  if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by the company 
further  the company faces considerable risk in its business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due to the company s inability to raise capital in the equity securities market 
if no additional operating capital is received during the next twelve months  the company will be forced to rely on existing cash in the bank and additional funds loaned by management and or significant stockholders  which raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
if necessary  it is the intent of management and significant stockholders to provide sufficient working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity 
however  no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the company or repay any such advances or loans exist 
in such a restricted cash flow scenario  the company would be unable to complete its business plan steps  and would  instead  delay all cash intensive activities 
without necessary cash flow  the company may become dormant during the next twelve months  or until such time as necessary funds can be raised in the equity securities market 
while the company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the company s ability to secure additional capital in the future to reach its goals have been made  there is no guarantee that the company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or implement its business plan 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  estimates include assumptions used in calculating share based compensation expense  the fair value of our financial instruments  and calculating the company s tax provision and related valuation allowance 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time acquired to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents represent short term investments consisting of investment grade corporate and government obligations  carried at cost  which approximates market value 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and notes payable  as applicable  approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these items and or the current interest rates payable in relation to current market conditions 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on either investments or on debt and is fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates 
the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to interest rate risk  if any 
financial risk is the risk that the company s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates 
the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to financial risk  if any 
other financial instruments at december  and  the carrying value of financial instruments such as payables approximated their fair values based on the short term maturities of these instruments 
the carrying value of other long term liabilities approximated fair values because the underlying interest rates approximate market rates at the balance sheet dates 
advertising costs for the years ended december  and  the company did not incur advertising expense 
reorganization costs the company has adopted the provisions required by the start up activities topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification whereby all costs incurred with the incorporation and reorganization  post bankruptcy  of the company were charged to operations as incurred 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax base of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
net loss per share basic net loss per share is calculated based on the net loss attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period excluding any dilutive effects of options  warrants  unvested share awards and convertible securities 
diluted net loss per common share assumes the conversion of all dilutive instruments  such as stock options 
as of december  and  the company had no dilutive instruments recently adopted accounting standards in february  the fasb issued amended guidance on subsequent events to alleviate potential conflicts between fasb guidance and sec requirements 
under this amended guidance  sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements 
this guidance was effective immediately and the company adopted these new requirements during the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued guidance on the milestone method for revenue recognition purposes 
previously  definitive guidance on when the use of the milestone method was appropriate did not exist 
this guidance provides a framework of the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued additional guidance on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the criteria for evaluating step of the goodwill impairment test and proceeding to step were amended for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
for public entities  this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  upon adoption of the amended guidance  any impairment will be recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption on its consolidated financial statements

the expenses for were mainly incurred for the maintenance of the corporate entity and the preparation and filing of periodic reports pursuant to the exchange act and a one time fee of  for an advisory fee 
the expenses for were incurred for consulting fees of approximately  fair value of shares issued with notes payable of approximately  legal and accounting fees of approximately  and travel expenses of approximately it is anticipated that future general and administrative expenditures in will range from approximately  to  due to increased periodic reporting requirements  the continued development of the company s business plan and the costs associated with entering into arrangements with mining operations to provide leased equipment and working capital financing 
upon entering into arrangements with mining operations  it is anticipated that the company s expenses will increase significantly 
if the company consummates a transaction to provide leased equipment and working capital financing to a mining operation  it will then incur additional operating costs and expenses to manage and oversee the loan and lease agreements 
once the loan and lease agreements are in place with a mining operation  the company will generate significant revenues and expects to generate profits that will be used to pay for the increased operating costs and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through funds provided by its stockholders and the net proceeds of the private placement of promissory notes 
from august  date of bankruptcy settlement through december   the company sold approximately  of promissory notes  received approximately  of cash from stockholders  and incurred approximately  of expenses paid by stockholders 
if the company consummates a transaction to provide leased equipment and working capital financing to a mining operation  it will fund the required capital by borrowing and or selling additional shares to raise the necessary capital 
the amount of the required capital will be determined by the capital required to fund an equipment lease and working capital loan required by the miner 
this amount could range from  to  it is anticipated that a combination of both debt instruments and equity sales will be required for the company to acquire the necessary capital to fund the loan and lease to a mining operation  but at this time it is unknown as to the exact amounts that will be available to the company 
the company anticipates that no matter how much it borrows or equity it sells  the cost of capital will be covered and a profit will be made from the payments made to the company by the mining operation on the lease and loan
