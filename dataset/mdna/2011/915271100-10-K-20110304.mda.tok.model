the information contained in this report may contain forward looking statements  including statements relating to univest s financial condition and results of operations that involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
univest s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated  projected  expected or projected as discussed in forward looking statements

critical accounting policies management  in order to prepare the corporation s financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions 
certain critical accounting policies  discussed below  could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions 
the corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available for sale and assessment for impairment of certain investment securities  reserve for loan and lease losses  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets and liabilities  benefit plans and stock based compensation as areas with critical accounting policies 
the corporation designates its investment securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
each of these designations affords different treatment in the statement of operations and statement of financial condition for market value changes affecting securities that are otherwise identical 
should evidence emerge that indicates that management s intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable  securities in the held to maturity or available for sale designations may be re categorized so that either statement of financial position or statement of operations adjustments may be required 
management evaluates debt securities  which comprise of u 
s 
government  government sponsored agencies  municipalities and other issuers  for other than temporary impairment and considers the current economic conditions  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  interest rates and the bond rating of each security 
all of the debt securities are highly rated as investment grade and management believes that it will not incur any losses 
the unrealized losses on the corporation s investments in debt securities are temporary in nature since they are primarily related to market interest rates and are not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers within our investment portfolio 
the corporation does not have the intent to sell the debt securities and believes it is more likely than not  that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis 
the credit portion of any loss on debt securities is recognized through earnings and the noncredit portion of any loss related to debt securities that the corporation does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that the corporation will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the corporation evaluates its equity securities for other than temporary impairment and recognizes other than temporary impairment charges when it has determined that it is probable that certain equity securities will not regain market value equivalent to the corporation s cost basis within a reasonable period of time due to a decline in the financial stability of the underlying companies 
management evaluates the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment and the corporation s positive intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery to the corporation s cost basis occurs 
reserves for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases  estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases  and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable 
the adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments 
rapid or sustained downturns in the economy may require increases in reserves that may negatively impact the corporation s results of operations and statements of financial condition in the periods requiring additional reserves 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the corporation in connection with its acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the corporation employs general industry practices in evaluating the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units  which are generally the bank  univest investments and univest insurance 
after this allocation is completed  a two step valuation process is applied 
for the bank  in step  fair value is determined based on a market approach  which measures fair value based on trading multiples of independent publicly traded entities of comparable sizes 
a second fair value analysis is performed using the income approach 
the corporation utilizes a net present value of cash flows of projected net income based on the compound annual growth rate of equity and a discount rate 
the discount rate is calculated by utilizing the cost of equity and the cost of debt methods 
if the fair value of the bank exceeds its adjusted book value  no write down of goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its adjusted book value  a step valuation procedure is required to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the valuation procedures applied in a step valuation are similar to those that would be performed upon an acquisition  with the step fair value representing a hypothetical reporting unit purchase price 
if the current market value does not exceed the net book value  impairment exists which requires an impairment charge to noninterest expense 
in its analysis of goodwill for univest insurance  inc and univest investments  inc  the corporation utilizes a net present value of cash flows of projected net income based on the compound annual growth rate of equity and a discount rate 
the discount rate is calculated by utilizing the cost of equity and the cost of debt methods 
a second fair value analysis is performed using the market approach which measures fair value based on trading multiples of independent publicly traded entities of comparable sizes 
the fair value that is calculated is compared to the net book value of each company 
if the fair value exceeds the net book value  no impairment exists 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its adjusted book value  a step valuation procedure is required to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the valuation procedures applied in a step valuation are similar to those that would be performed upon an acquisition  with the step fair value representing a hypothetical reporting unit purchase price 
if the current market value does not exceed the net book value  impairment exists which requires an impairment charge to noninterest expense 
for other intangible assets  changes in the useful life or economic value of acquired assets may require a reduction in the asset value carried on the financial statements of the corporation and a related charge in the statement of operations 
such changes in asset value could result from a change in market demand for the products or services offered by an acquired business or by reductions in the expected profit margins that can be obtained through the future delivery of the acquired product or service line 
the corporation has mortgage servicing rights for mortgages it originated  subsequently sold and retained servicing 
the value of the rights is booked as income when the corresponding mortgages are sold 
the income booked at sale is the estimated present value of the cash flows that will be received from servicing the loans over the entire future term 
the term of a servicing right can be reasonably estimated using prepayment assumptions of comparable assets priced in the secondary market 
as mortgage rates being offered to the public decrease  the life of loan servicing rights tends to shorten  as borrowers have increased incentive to refinance 
shortened loan servicing lives require changes in the value of the servicing rights that have already been recorded to be marked down in the statement of operations of the servicing company 
this may cause a material change in reported operations for the corporation depending on the size of the servicing portfolio and the degree of change in the prepayment speed of the type and coupon of loans being serviced 
the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits 
enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the corporation s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 

table of contents the corporation has a retirement plan that it provides as a benefit to employees hired before december  and former employees 
the corporation also provides supplemental retirement plans that it provides as a benefit to certain current and former executives 
determining the adequacy of the funding of these plans may require estimates of future salary rate increases  of long term rates of investment return  and the use of an appropriate discount rate for the obligation 
changes in these estimates and assumptions due to changes in the economic environment or financial markets may result in material changes in the corporation s results of operations or statement of financial condition 
the fair value of share based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the corporation uses the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
the black scholes model estimates the fair value of employee stock options using a pricing model which takes into consideration the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the option  the current market price and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
readers of the corporation s financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the corporation s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the corporation at that time

equity securities have no stated maturity and the current dividend yields may not be recognized in future periods 
the weighted average yield is calculated by dividing income  which has not been tax equated on tax exempt obligations  within each contractual maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment

at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the interest rate is renegotiated and the term of the loan is extended for an additional three or five years 
at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the bank also has the right to require payment in full 
these are included in the due in one to five years category in the table above 
asset quality performance of the entire loan and lease portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by bank management and loan officers 
a number of factors regarding the borrower  such as overall financial strength  collateral values and repayment ability  are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes 
when a loan or lease  including a loan or lease impaired  is classified as nonaccrual  the accrual of interest on such a loan or lease is discontinued 
a loan or lease is classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest  even though the loan or lease is currently performing 
a loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured 
when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status  unpaid interest credited to income is reversed 
interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases is either applied against principal or reported as interest income  according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal 

table of contents loans or leases are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current  has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt 
total cash basis  troubled debt restructured and nonaccrual loans and leases totaled million at december   million at december   and million at december   the balance at december  and primarily consisted of commercial real estate  construction and commercial  financial and agricultural loans

at december   the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired was million  all of which were on a nonaccrual basis or troubled debt restructured 
the related reserve for loan and lease losses for those loans was million 
the amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits 
specific reserves have been established based on current facts and management s judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits 
impaired loans and leases increased million during mainly consisting of increases in commercial real estate of million  commercial  financial and agricultural of million partially offset by a decrease in construction loans of million 
the increase in impaired loans was primarily due to the migration of five relationships to non accrual status during the third and fourth quarters of these relationships were not concentrated in any one industry and consisted of hotel office space  investment commercial real estate  a construction company  and a manufacturing company 
the related specific reserve for these credits was thousand at december  to cover deficiencies in the underlying real estate value under current market conditions 
the decrease in impaired construction loans during was largely due to a payoff of a million construction loan during the second quarter of impaired loans at december  included two large commercial construction real estate credits which went on non accrual during the third quarter of one credit was a shared national credit to a continuing care retirement community in which the corporation participated 
the parent company of the community came under financial difficulty and as a result  the parent company and all communities declared bankruptcy 
this credit was paid off in the second quarter of as discussed previously 
the second credit is for four separate facilities to a local commercial real estate developer home builder which aggregated to million at december  there is a specific allowance on this credit of thousand at december  to cover deficiencies in the underlying real estate value under current market conditions 
the borrower does not have the resources to develop these properties themselves  therefore  the properties must be sold 
the corporation will continue to closely monitor this credit relationship and may have to provide additional reserve in future quarters related to this credit 
during  the corporation acquired five other real estate owned properties  four of which were sold during two other real estate owned properties were acquired in  one of which was sold during the fourth quarter of at december   the corporation owned two other real estate owned properties which were commercial properties

management s methodology to determine the adequacy of and the provision to the reserve considers specific credit reviews  past loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions and trends and the volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is determined through a monthly evaluation of reserve adequacy 
this analysis takes into consideration the growth of the loan and lease portfolio  the status of past due loans and leases  current economic conditions  various types of lending activity  policies  real estate and other loan commitments  and significant changes in charge off activity 
nonaccrual loans and leases  and those which are troubled debt restructured  are evaluated individually 
all other loans and leases are evaluated as pools 
based on historical loss experience  loss factors are determined giving consideration to the areas noted in the first paragraph and applied to the pooled loan and lease categories to develop the general or allocated portion of the reserve 
loans are also reviewed for impairment based on discounted cash flows using the loans initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
management also reviews the activity within the reserve to determine what actions  if any  should be taken to address differences between estimated and actual losses 
any of the above factors may cause the provision to fluctuate 
wholesale leasing portfolios are purchased by the bank s subsidiary  univest capital 
credit losses on these purchased portfolios are largely the responsibility of the seller up to pre set dollar amounts initially equal to to percent of the portfolio purchase amount 
the dollar amount of recourse for purchased portfolios is inclusive of cash holdbacks and purchase discounts 
purchased wholesale leasing portfolios outstanding equaled million at december  
table of contents the reserve for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of the loan or lease portfolio under current economic conditions and such other factors  which deserve recognition in estimating loan and lease losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
additions to the reserve arise from the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan and lease charge offs reduce the reserve 
loans and leases are charged off when there has been permanent impairment or when in the opinion of management the full amount of the loan and lease  in the case of non collateral dependent borrowings  will not be realized 
certain impaired loans are reported at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
the reserve for loan and lease losses consists of allocated reserve and unallocated reserve categories 
the allocated reserve is comprised of reserves established on specific loans and leases  and class reserves based on historical loan and lease loss experience  current trends  and management assessments 
the unallocated reserve is based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the corporation s individual markets and portfolios and is to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process and the potential volatility in the aforementioned markets and portfolios 
the specific reserve element is based on a regular analysis of impaired commercial and real estate loans 
for these loans  the specific reserve established is based on an analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class reserve element is determined by an internal loan and lease grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
the corporation revises the class allowance factors whenever necessary  but no less than quarterly  in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan or lease pool classification 
the corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded in categories with historical loss experience 
table allocated  other loan and lease loss reserves the reserve for loan and lease losses is made up of the allocated reserve and the unallocated portion 
the following table summarizes the two categories as of the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands allocated unallocated total allocated reserves at december  increased by million compared to december  primarily due to an increase in the historical loss factor related to non criticized commercial real estate construction loans partially offset by a decrease in the allocated reserves for commercial  financial and agricultural loans resulting from a decrease in the level of criticized loans and a decrease in the adjusted historical loss factor related to criticized loans 
allocated reserves at december  increased by million compared to december  mainly due to the migration of commercial  financial  agricultural loans and commercial real estate construction loans to higher risk ratings including criticized and non performing loan categories as a result of deterioration of underlying collateral and economic factors 
unallocated reserves increased in by thousand and in by thousand primarily due to economic volatility 
as a result  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to at december  from at december  and from at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases equaled at december   at december   and at december  at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the balance of impaired loans of million 
at december   the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the impaired loan balance of million 
at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was thousand  or of the balance of impaired loans of million 
management closely monitors the credit worthiness and the value of underlying collateral as a commercial credit becomes past due 
these factors along with historical and economic trends  and management s assumptions  are taken into consideration in providing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
when the loan becomes impaired and is placed on non accrual  a specific allowance is created for the impaired loan

asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate earnings  capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of customers and corporate needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing rates 

table of contents the corporation uses both an interest sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities

at december   the interest rate swap had a positive fair value of million which was classified on the balance sheet in other assets 
the underlying commercial loan had a positive fair value adjustment on the termination date of thousand which is being amortized through a reduction of interest income over the remaining life 
at december   the underlying commercial loan had a negative fair value adjustment of thousand  which was classified on the balance sheet as a component of loans and leases 
for this interest rate swap  the corporation recognized fair value adjustments which resulted in a loss of million and a gain of thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively

in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios at origination are generally limited to 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios and are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
the primary risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations 
the corporation has strict underwriting  review  and monitoring procedures in place to mitigate this risk 
risk also lies in the residual value of the underlying equipment

this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value 
the corporation greatly reduces this risk by using buyout leases  in which the entire cost of the leased equipment is included in the contractual payments  leaving no residual payment at the end of the lease terms 
the corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed  by attempting to contact all borrowers

these funds are fully collateralized by the bank s investment portfolio and are at current money market mutual fund rates 
this funding source is subject to changes in the asset allocations of the trust accounts 
the bank may purchase certificates from the pennsylvania local government investment trust plgit to augment its short term fixed funding sources 
the plgit deposits are public funds collateralized with a letter of credit that plgit maintains with the fhlb  therefore  univest national bank is not required to provide collateral on these deposits 
at december  and  the bank had no plgit deposits 

table of contents the corporation  through the bank  has short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
at december  and  total outstanding short term and long term borrowings with the fhlb totaled million and million  respectively 
at december   the bank also had outstanding short term letters of credit with the fhlb totaling million which were utilized to collateralize seasonal public funds deposits 
the maximum borrowing capacity changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets as well as the fhlb s internal credit rating of the bank and the amount of funds received may be reduced by additional required purchases of fhlb stock 
the bank maintains federal fund credit lines with several correspondent banks totaling million at december  and outstanding borrowings under these lines totaled million at december   there were no outstanding balances at december  future availability under these lines is subject to the prerogatives of the granting banks and may be withdrawn at will 
the corporation  through the bank  has an available line of credit at the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  the amount of which is dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
at december  and  the corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line 
cash requirements the corporation has cash requirements including various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments 
the following contractual obligations and commitments table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties 
the most significant obligation  in both the under and over one year time period  is for the bank to repay its certificates of deposit short term borrowings consisting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase constitute the next largest payment obligation 
the bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its branch network  thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market 
the table also shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
commitments to extend credit are the bank s most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods 
contractual obligations and commitments the corporation enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset liability management  to fund acquisitions and to meet required capital needs 
these obligations require the corporation to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table below 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to manage the corporation s exposure to fluctuation in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby and commercial letters of credit and forward contracts 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract or notional amounts of these financial instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
unless noted otherwise  the corporation does not require and is not required to pledge collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 
these commitments expire over time as detailed in table for further information regarding the corporation s commitments  refer to footnote of the consolidated financial statements  herein

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
in the course of its lending  leasing and deposit taking activities  the corporation is subject to changes in the economic value and or earnings potential of these assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation s investment asset liability management committee manages interest rate risk in a manner so as to provide adequate and reliable earnings 
this is accomplished through the establishment of policy limits on maximum risk exposures  as well as the regular and timely monitoring of reports designed to quantify risk and return levels 
the corporation uses both an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation is permitted to use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps floors with indices that correlate to on balance sheet instruments  to modify its indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on the corporation s current economic outlook 

table of contents at december   the simulation  based upon forward looking assumptions  projects that the corporation s greatest interest margin exposure to interest rate risk would occur if interest rates decreased from present levels 
given the assumptions  a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp up basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately more than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
a basis point a basis point ramp down would not be relevant in the current market conditions parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp down basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately less than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
policy limits have been established which allow a tolerance for no more than approximately a negative impact to the interest margin resulting from a basis point parallel yield curve shift over a forward looking month period
