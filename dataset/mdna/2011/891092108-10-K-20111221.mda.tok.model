item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management discussion and analysis md a provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other readers to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we design  manufacture  and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf irrigation systems  agricultural micro irrigation systems  landscaping equipment and lighting  and residential yard and snow removal products worldwide 
we sell our products worldwide through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet 
our businesses are organized into three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and is shown as other 
our emphasis is to provide innovative  well built  and dependable products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues have historically been  and we expect they will continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
we define new products as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years 
summary of fiscal results fiscal was a strong year with both double digit net sales and earnings growth 
our fiscal results included the following items of significance net sales for fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal to a record of  million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased demand for our products across all of our businesses largely resulting from the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers  improved market conditions in our professional segment  and incremental sales of million from acquisitions 
professional segment net sales  which represented percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal  grew percent in fiscal compared to fiscal shipments increased due to higher demand for most of our professional segment products largely resulting from the successful introduction of new products  strong demand in the worldwide golf market  continued growth in the micro irrigation market  particularly in eastern europe  and a rebound in the rental market 
our residential segment net sales were up by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily from strong demand for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers 
shipments of snow thrower products also increased as our channel partners purchased products to fill depleted field inventory levels for the snow season following strong sales from heavy snow falls during the snow season  as well as additional product placement 
however  sales of walk power mowers and electric blowers were down due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions 
international net sales for fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal  due also to increased demand for our products largely resulting from the successful introduction of new products  new golf development projects in asia  and additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and enabled higher sales of our micro irrigation products for agricultural markets to meet growing worldwide demand 
to meet increasing worldwide demand for micro irrigation products for the agricultural market  particularly in eastern europe  we completed the construction of our new manufacturing facility in romania in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  approximately million of our net sales growth was the result of the weakening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
international net sales comprised percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal fiscal net earnings of million rose percent compared to fiscal  and diluted net earnings per share increased percent in fiscal to compared to in fiscal our net earnings were hampered by a pre tax charge of million due to costs associated with a rework for a non safety quality issue that affected a large number of our residential segment walk power mowers 
gross margin was percent in fiscal  a decline of basis points from percent in fiscal higher average commodity prices and increased freight expense from higher fuel prices hindered our gross margin rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal although selling  general  and administrative sg a expense was up percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was down to percent compared to percent in fiscal  reflecting further leveraging of our sg a costs over higher sales volumes plus lower product liability expense 
however  marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher sales volumes and incentive programs designed to promote sales growth 
receivables increased percent as of the end of fiscal due to higher sales volumes compared to fiscal our inventory levels were also up by percent as of the end of fiscal compared to fiscal as we pre bought engines for production planning and pricing efficiencies 
average net working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables as a percent of net sales as of the end of fiscal was percent compared to percent as of the end of fiscal this increase was due mainly to higher average inventory levels in fiscal compared to fiscal as we prebuilt inventory  mainly for residential turf products  in anticipation of higher demand  which did not occur as expected due primarily to unfavorable weather conditions 
our domestic field inventory levels were also slightly higher as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal due in part to anticipated increase in retail demand 
we continued our history of paying quarterly cash dividends and increased our fiscal quarterly cash dividend by percent to per share compared to our quarterly cash dividend in fiscal of per share 
our stock repurchase program continued to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders in the amount of million during fiscal  which continued to reduce our number of shares outstanding 
this reduction resulted in a benefit to our diluted net earnings per share of approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal destination in fiscal  we launched our new enterprise wide multi year initiative  destination  that will take us to our centennial in and into our second century 
this four year initiative is intended to focus our efforts on driving our legacy of excellence through building caring relationships and engaging in innovation 
as this is a multi year initiative  we will strive to achieve our destination goals by pursuing a progression of annual milestones 
each fiscal year we will set forth associated organic revenue growth  operating earnings  and employee engagement goals  such as continuous improvement projects with cross functional collaboration  and we will also strive to continue to focus on the progress we made through our previous initiatives  such as working capital 
organic revenue growth 
we intend to pursue strategic growth of our existing businesses and product categories with an annual organic revenue growth goal 
we will strive to achieve million in organic revenue growth in each of fiscal    and we define organic revenue growth as the increase in net sales  less net sales from acquisitions that occurred in the current fiscal year 
we exceeded our fiscal organic revenue growth goal of million for fiscal operating earnings growth 
as part of our dual strategy growth goals  we have also set a bold earnings goal to raise operating earnings as a percentage of net sales to percent by the end of fiscal in fiscal  we made progress towards this goal by achieving operating earnings as a percentage of net sales of percent 
outlook for fiscal while our financial results for fiscal were positive  uncertainty in worldwide economies has increased 
despite this uncertainty  we are prepared to operate effectively in this slow growth environment and are encouraged by our investments 
we have taken  and continue to take  proactive measures that we expect will enable us to manage through this current environment and position us to achieve strong financial results and gain market share supported in part by a high level of new products to drive demand 
we believe the key drivers for our fiscal financial performance will include  among many others  the following main factors we expect international markets will remain a focus for us to grow our revenues 
we plan to continue investing in new products designed specifically for international markets and in infrastructure around the world  connecting us more closely to international customers and increasing our global presence 
for example  during fiscal  we completed the construction of a new manufacturing facility in romania to manufacture micro irrigation products for the agricultural market as we anticipate future market demand for our water conserving products to increase in and around that geographic region 
however  we expect economic uncertainty and slowing growth in key international markets may hamper our net sales in fiscal a long term goal is for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
we anticipate fiscal net sales in our professional segment to increase compared to fiscal as we continue to prepare for the phase in of additional tier emission requirements that will affect our products having diesel engines with greater than horsepower  but less than horsepower  that are manufactured after january  and sold in the us and canada  we will also continue to incur significant research  development  engineering  and other costs to comply with these new regulations 
ultimately  we expect that we will implement price increases  some of which may be significant  for our products subject to these regulations 
accordingly  we are anticipating that some customers may purchase products impacted by these requirements in fiscal  prior to price increases going into effect for products manufactured after january   which may result in higher sales volumes of our diesel engine products in fiscal than we have experienced in the past or expect to experience in the future 
we also anticipate growth in the irrigation market to continue in fiscal for products that help conserve the use of water  namely for the commercial  residential  and agricultural markets  as the need to become more efficient in water use is expected to drive demand for our products 
we plan to continue to invest in new irrigation products  manufacturing capacity  and infrastructure globally as products used for water conservation are expected to be a long term focus for us 
our long term goal is for water related products to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
although we anticipate the economic environment to be sluggish in fiscal for residential consumers  we expect our residential segment net sales to slightly increase compared to fiscal we anticipate that our new walk power mower product offering will be well received by customers in fiscal and expect continued growth in demand for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers we introduced in fiscal during fiscal  we anticipate our gross margin rate to increase compared to fiscal we anticipate average prices for commodities to be higher in fiscal compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal we plan to mitigate anticipated higher commodity costs by continuing to aggressively pursue cost reduction efforts and increasing prices on certain products 
in fiscal  we experienced some quality issues that hampered our gross margin and reminded us of the impact these issues have on both our customers and our financial results 
therefore  in fiscal we intend to increase our focus on quality while realizing greater efficiencies in our processes 
we expect net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to be up in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven mainly by our expectation of sales growth and an improvement in our gross margin rate  as well as a reduction in our diluted shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our emphasis on efficient asset utilization 
in fiscal  our average inventory levels were higher than expected as we prebuilt inventory  mainly for residential turf products  in anticipation of higher demand  which did not occur as expected due primarily to unfavorable weather conditions 
in fiscal  we anticipate average inventory levels to be lower as compared to average inventory levels in fiscal due in part to increased focus on asset management to limit additional buildup of inventory 
we anticipate our average net working capital as a percentage of net sales in fiscal to decrease compared to fiscal consistent with our focus on asset management  we believe our domestic field inventory levels are currently appropriate and we anticipate field inventory levels to be approximately equivalent as of the end of fiscal compared to the field inventory levels as of the end of fiscal we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on the global economic environment  retail demand  field inventory levels  commodity prices  weather conditions  competitive actions  expenses  and other factors identified in part i  item a  risk factors of this report  which could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated outlook 
results of operations fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  an increase of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings improvement were sales growth in all of our businesses  leveraging of fixed sg a costs over higher sales volumes  and a lower effective tax rate  somewhat offset by higher commodity and freight expense that negatively impacted our gross margin rate  as well as a pre tax charge of million due to costs associated with a rework for a non safety quality issue that affected a large number of our residential segment walk power mowers 
in addition  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  an increase of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings improvement were higher sales volumes  an increase in gross margin  leveraging of fixed sg a costs  and an increase in other income 
in addition  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of our consolidated net sales 
fiscal years ended october net sales cost of sales gross margin sg a expense operating earnings interest expense other income expense  net provision for income taxes net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
this net sales improvement was primarily driven by higher shipments of worldwide professional segment products largely resulting from the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers and resulted in increased sales  strong worldwide demand for golf equipment and irrigation systems  additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and enabled higher sales of our water conserving products for agricultural markets to meet growing worldwide demand  particularly in eastern europe  and incremental sales of million from acquisitions 
an increase in residential segment net sales attributable to strong demand for snow thrower products as our channel partners purchased product to fill depleted field inventory levels for the snow season following strong sales from heavy snow falls during the snow season  as well as additional product placement 
in addition  riding product sales increased primarily from positive customer acceptance for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers 
however  sales of walk power mowers and electric blowers were down due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions 
international net sales were also up for both our professional and residential segments due to increased demand primarily from improved market conditions in our key international regions and the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers 
additionally  a weaker average us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business accounted for approximately million of our net sales increase 
gross margin 
gross margin represents gross profit net sales less cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled cost of sales  for a description of expenses included in cost of sales 
gross margin decreased by basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this decline was mainly the result of the following factors higher average prices paid for commodities in fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in freight expense due to higher fuel prices 
rework costs for a non safety quality issue that affected a large number of our residential segment walk power mowers 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were lower manufacturing costs from higher plant utilization  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
a higher proportionate share of professional segment sales that carry higher average gross margins than residential segment sales 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
sg a expense increased million  or percent  from fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled selling  general  and administrative expense  for a description of expenses included in sg a expense 
sg a expense rate represents sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
sg a expense rate in fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over higher sales volumes and lower product liability expense of nearly million due to favorable claims experience this fiscal year 
however  marketing expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher sales volumes and incentive programs designed to promote sales growth 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal slightly decreased by percent compared to fiscal as a result of lower average debt levels 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists mainly of our proportionate share of income or losses from equity investments affiliates  currency exchange rate gains and losses  litigation settlements and recoveries  interest income  and financing revenue 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or percent 
this increase in other income  net was due mainly to an increase in income from affiliates  somewhat offset by higher foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the retroactive reenactment of the domestic research tax credit 
we anticipate our tax rate for fiscal to be higher than fiscal due to the expiration of the domestic research tax credit on december  fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
this net sales improvement was primarily driven by higher shipments of worldwide professional segment products largely resulting from improved economic conditions  a significant reduction in field inventory levels during fiscal that was not duplicated during fiscal  the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers and resulted in increased sales  and additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and enabled higher sales of our water conserving products for agricultural markets to meet growing worldwide demand 
an increase in residential segment net sales attributable to strong demand  resulting in part from customer acceptance of and additional product placement for zero turn radius riding mowers 
in addition  shipments of snow thrower products were up due to increased demand from heavy snow falls during the winter season of and the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal international net sales were also up for both our professional and residential segments due also to increased demand primarily from improved market conditions in our key international regions and the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers  as well as a weaker average us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business that accounted for approximately million of our net sales increase 
partially offsetting those positive factors was a decline in net sales for our other segment due to the elimination of toro credit company tcc  our wholly owned financing company  floor plan interest costs resulting from the establishment of red iron  our financing joint venture with tcfif  as well as lower net sales at our wholly owned midwestern distributorship 
gross margin 
gross margin increased by basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this improvement was mainly the result of the following factors a higher proportionate share of professional segment sales that carry higher average gross margins than residential segment sales 
lower manufacturing costs from higher plant utilization  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
cost reduction efforts implemented during fiscal and somewhat offsetting those positive factors were higher average prices paid for commodities in fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in our last in first out lifo reserve of million in fiscal  as compared to a reduction in our lifo reserve in fiscal that benefited our gross margin by million in fiscal an increase in freight expense due to higher fuel prices 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
sg a expense increased million  or percent  from fiscal sg a expense rate in fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over higher sales volumes 
the following factors increased our sg a expense an increase of million in employee incentive compensation expense as a result of improved financial performance in fiscal  as compared to fiscal higher marketing and warehousing costs of nearly million as a result of increased sales volumes 
an increase in product liability expense of million as a result of unfavorable claims experience 
somewhat offsetting those increases were costs incurred in fiscal for work force adjustments of million that were not duplicated in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal as a result of lower average debt levels 
other income expense  net 
other income for fiscal was million compared to other expense of million in fiscal this increase in other income  net was due mainly to the following factors expenses incurred in fiscal for several legal matters in the aggregate of million that were not duplicated in fiscal an increase in income from affiliates of nearly million 
somewhat offsetting those increases was a decline in financing revenue of million 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a valuation allowance recorded in fiscal of million for foreign subsidiaries net operating loss carry forwards that was not duplicated in fiscal and the favorable resolution of a transfer pricing issue 
this decrease was somewhat offset by the expiration of the domestic research tax credit on december  performance by business segment as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and is shown as other 
operating earnings for our professional and residential segments are defined as earnings from operations plus other income expense  net 
operating loss for the other segment includes earnings loss from wholly owned domestic distribution companies  corporate activities  other income expense  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments net sales and operating results 
professional professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal  percent for fiscal  and percent for fiscal the following table shows the professional segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales   change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal primarily from higher shipments for most domestic and international products as a result of improved market conditions in our professional segment 
in addition  professional segment sales increased due to the following other factors higher shipments and demand of worldwide golf maintenance equipment and irrigation systems due to new golf development projects in key international markets  particularly in asia  and domestic renovation projects  as well as positive customer response for new products we introduced 
increased sales of landscape contractor equipment and grounds products primarily from the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers 
increased net sales of micro irrigation products due to continued growing market demand  particularly in eastern europe  and additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and enabled higher sales of our water conserving products for agricultural markets 
strong sales of sitework systems products as a result of the rebound in the rental market and the successful introduction of new products 
incremental sales of million from acquisitions 
a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal primarily from higher shipments for most domestic and international product categories as a result of improved economic conditions and a significant reduction in field inventory levels during fiscal that was not duplicated in fiscal in addition  professional segment sales increased due to higher shipments of worldwide golf maintenance equipment and irrigation systems as customers increased capital spending after delayed investments during fiscal and from poor economic conditions and new golf development projects  particularly in asia  as well as the positive customer response for new products we introduced 
shipments of landscape contractor equipment were also strong as a result of the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers 
net sales of micro irrigation products increased due to our investments in additional manufacturing capacity that increased production of our water conserving products to meet the growing worldwide market demand 
additionally  a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business also contributed to the sales growth 
our domestic field inventory levels of our professional segment products were slightly down as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal operating earnings 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal due primarily to higher sales volumes 
expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased basis points to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted professional segment operating earnings lower gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher average commodity prices and increased freight expense driven by higher fuel prices 
those increases were somewhat offset by lower manufacturing costs from higher plant utilization  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
a decline in sg a expense rate in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to leveraging fixed sg a costs spread over higher sales volumes and a decline in product liability expense 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the operating profit improvement was due mainly to higher gross margins as a result of increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs from increased plant utilization due to increased demand for our products  combined with our cost reduction efforts 
however  increased freight expense and rising commodity prices hampered our professional segment gross margin improvement 
also contributing to the professional segment operating earnings improvement was a decline in our sg a expense rate due primarily to leveraging sg a costs over higher sales volumes 
residential residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal and percent for both fiscal and the following table shows the residential segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following factors strong demand for our snow thrower products as our channel partners purchased product to fill depleted field inventory levels for the snow season following strong sales from heavy snow falls during the snow season  as well as additional product placement 
an increase in shipments of zero turn radius riding mowers attributable to continued strong demand  resulting primarily from customer acceptance of new products 
a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
somewhat offsetting those increases was a decline in sales of walk power mowers and electric blowers due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions 
our domestic field inventory levels of our residential segment products were slightly up as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to strong shipments of zero turn radius riding mowers attributable to strong demand  resulting in part from customer acceptance of new products and additional product placement 
sales of snow thrower products were also up due to increased demand from heavy snow falls during the winter season of and the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business benefited residential segment net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal operating earnings 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins declined basis points to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted residential segment operating earnings lower gross margins primarily attributable to costs associated with a rework for a non safety quality issue that affected a large number of our walk power mowers  higher average commodity prices  and increased freight expense 
those increases were somewhat offset by lower manufacturing costs from higher plant utilization  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
an increase in sg a expense mainly from an increase in warranty expense due to special warranty modifications  as well as higher spending for marketing  warehousing  and engineering 
however  a decline in product liability expense somewhat offset the increase in sg a expense 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins improved to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal due to an improvement in gross margins primarily from increased sales volumes of higher margin products and the resulting effects of cost reduction efforts 
these favorable benefits were somewhat offset by higher commodity costs  an increase in freight expense  and higher manufacturing costs due to operating inefficiencies as a result of higher than anticipated customer demand 
in addition  sg a expense increased from higher spending for marketing  product liability  incentive compensation  and warehousing costs 
other dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating loss net sales 
net sales for the other segment includes sales from our wholly owned domestic distribution companies less sales from the professional and residential segments to those distribution companies 
in fiscal  the other segment also included elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from tcc 
with the establishment of red iron beginning in fiscal  net sales for the other segment no longer includes corporate financing activities  including the elimination of floor plan costs from tcc  which results in lower net sales for the other segment 
the other segment net sales in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal due to incremental sales from the addition of a us western based distribution company that was acquired on october  the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal as a result of the elimination of tcc floor plan interest costs  as well as lower net sales at our wholly owned midwestern distributorship 
operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal this loss decrease was primarily attributable to improved profitability of our wholly owned domestic distribution companies and an increase in income from affiliates 
somewhat offsetting those factors were higher foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee incentive compensation expense due to improved financial performance in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the elimination of tcc floor plan costs 
somewhat offsetting those factors was a decline in expenses incurred in fiscal for several legal matters that were not duplicated in fiscal  income from our investment in red iron  overall reduced spending from our leaner cost structure as a result of actions we implemented in fiscal  as well as elimination of costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments 
financial condition working capital the following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october average cash and cash equivalents average receivables  net average inventories  net average accounts payable average days outstanding for receivables average inventory turnover times average net receivables increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to higher sales volumes 
our average days outstanding for receivables improved to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal primarily as a result of floor plan and certain open account receivables being financed with red iron  our financing joint venture with tcfif  instead of directly with us 
average net inventories increased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal as we prebuilt inventory during fiscal  mainly for residential turf products  in anticipation of higher demand  which did not occur as expected due primarily to unfavorable weather conditions 
as a result  average inventory turnover decreased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal average accounts payable increased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven by higher average inventory levels and production  as well as our supply chain initiatives 
as a result of the combination of these increases  our average net working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables as a percentage of net sales was percent as of the end of fiscal compared to percent as of the end of fiscal in fiscal  we intend to continue our efforts on efficient asset management  with an increased focus on minimizing the amount of working capital in the supply chain and maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end users 
we expect average receivables to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal as we anticipate higher sales volumes in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate average inventory turnover to improve and average inventory levels to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal due in part to increased focus on asset management to limit additional buildup of inventory levels 
we also anticipate average accounts payable to increase slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal driven by our continued focus on our supply chain initiatives 
capital expenditures and other long term assets fiscal capital expenditures of million were percent higher compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to production equipment and tooling expenditures for new products  as well as for a new manufacturing facility in romania that was completed in fiscal and will increase production of our micro irrigation water conserving products for the agricultural market 
capital expenditures for fiscal are planned to be approximately million as we expect to continue to invest in new product tooling and replacement production equipment 
long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   an increase of percent 
this increase was due primarily to the addition of intangible assets from acquisitions 
capital structure the following table details the components of our total capitalization and key ratios 
dollars in millions october short term debt long term debt  including current portion stockholders equity debt to capitalization ratio our debt to capitalization ratio increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in stockholders equity as we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock and a slight increase in long term debt that was issued as part of our acquisitions in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production  replacement parts inventory  payroll and other administrative costs  capital expenditures  establishment of new facilities  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing of receivables from customers that are not financed with red iron 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  bank credit lines  and cash on hand  will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating requirements 
we believe that the funds available through existing financing arrangements and forecasted cash flows will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  debt repayments  quarterly cash dividend payments  and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
cash dividends each quarter in fiscal  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share  which was an percent increase over our cash dividend of per share paid each quarter in fiscal as announced on november   our board of directors recently increased our fiscal first quarter quarterly cash dividend by percent to per share from the quarterly cash dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal cash flow cash flows provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities during the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table 
dollars in millions cash provided by used in fiscal years ended october operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net cash used provided cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end cash flows from operating activities 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or percent  from fiscal this decrease was due to a lower amount of accounts payable as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal  whereas in fiscal  we had a significant increase in accounts payable as compared to the end of fiscal  which contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal additionally  cash used for higher inventory levels  as previously discussed  also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal  somewhat offset by higher net earnings 
cash flows from investing activities 
capital expenditures and acquisitions are our primary uses of capital resources 
these investments are intended to enable sales growth in new markets and expand existing markets  help us to meet product demand  and increase our manufacturing efficiencies and capacity 
cash used in investing activities was up percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to an increase in purchases of property  plant  and equipment  mainly for our new manufacturing facility in romania  and higher amounts of cash utilized for acquisitions 
those increases were somewhat offset by distributions we received in fiscal from our red iron joint venture whereas in fiscal  we utilized cash for our investment in our red iron joint venture 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased slightly by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower levels of funds used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal compared to fiscal credit lines and other capital resources our businesses are seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april  as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
the seasonality of production and shipments causes our working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year 
seasonal cash requirements are financed from operations  cash on hand  and with short term financing arrangements  including our million unsecured senior four year revolving credit facility that expires in july  which replaced our prior revolving facility that was scheduled to mature in january included in our million revolving credit facility is a sublimit for standby letters of credit and a sublimit for swingline loans 
at our election and with the approval of the named borrowers on the revolving credit facility  the aggregate maximum principal amount available under the facility may be increased by an amount up to million in aggregate 
funds are available under the revolving credit facility for working capital  capital expenditures  and other lawful purposes  including  but not limited to  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
interest expense on this credit line is determined based on a libor rate or other rates quoted by the administrative agent  bank of america  na plus a basis point spread defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our non us operations maintain unsecured short term lines of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
as of october   we had no outstanding short term debt under these lines of credit 
as of october   we also had million of outstanding letters of credit 
as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under our credit agreements 
the revolving credit facility contains standard covenants  including  without limitation  financial covenants  such as the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to earnings ratios  and negative covenants  which among other things  limit loans and investments  disposition of assets  consolidations and mergers  transactions with affiliates  restricted payments  contingent obligations  liens and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions 
under the revolving credit facility  we are not limited to payments of cash dividends and stock repurchases as long as our debt to ebitda ratio from the previous quarter compliance certificate is less than or equal to  however  we are limited to million per fiscal year if our debt to ebitda ratio from the previous quarter compliance certificate is greater than 
as of october   we are not limited to payments of cash dividends and stock repurchases as our debt to ebitda ratio was below 
we were also in compliance with all covenants related to our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility as of october   and we expect to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by this credit agreement following the applicable cure period  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term senior notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our short term debt under our credit agreement 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade and or our average debt to ebitda ratio rises above  the basis point spread over libor or other rates quoted by the administrative agent  bank of america  na we currently pay on our outstanding short term debt under the credit agreement would increase 
however  the credit commitment could not be cancelled by the banks based solely on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt was unchanged during fiscal by standard and poor ratings group at bbb and by moody investors service at baa share repurchase plan during fiscal  we continued repurchasing shares of our common stock in the open market  thereby reducing our shares outstanding 
in addition  our repurchase programs provided shares for use in connection with our equity compensation programs 
as of october    shares remained available for repurchase under our board authorization 
the following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except per share data fiscal years ended october shares of common stock purchased   cost to repurchase common stock average price paid per share we expect to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock in fiscal depending upon market conditions and our cash position 
customer financing arrangements wholesale financing 
in fiscal  we established our red iron joint venture with tcfif 
the purpose of red iron is to provide inventory financing  including floor plan and open account receivable financing  to distributors and dealers of our products in the us and to select distributors of our products in canada to enable our distributors and dealers to carry representative inventories of our products 
under a separate arrangement  tcfcfc provides inventory financing to dealers of our products in canada 
under these financing arrangements  down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor and or the dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
red iron retains a security interest in the distributors and dealers financed inventories  and those inventories are monitored regularly 
floor plan terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment  which secures the indebtedness  is sold to customers  or when payment terms become due  whichever occurs first 
rates are generally indexed to libor plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
red iron financed  million of new receivables for dealers and distributors during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  some independent international dealers continue to finance their products with a third party financing company 
this third party financing company purchased million of receivables from us during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies and red iron for receivables financed by them 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to a maximum amount of million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies and red iron over the past three fiscal years 
however  a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we continue to provide financing in the form of open account terms to home centers and mass retailers  general line irrigation dealers  international distributors and dealers other than the canadian distributors and dealers to whom red iron provides financing arrangements  government customers  and rental companies 
end user financing 
we have agreements with third party financing companies to provide lease financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers in the us and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
during fiscal  we entered into an amended agreement with a third party financing company that eliminated our contingent liability for any residual value risk on the underlying equipment financed under this program 
in addition  under the terms of the amended agreement  we are only contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection risk for leases entered into prior to the effective date of the amended agreement 
based on actual losses and balances outstanding for leases entered into prior to the effective date of the amended agreement  we do not anticipate we would have any contingent liability for potential future losses 
from time to time  we enter into agreements where we provide recourse to third party finance companies in the event of default by the customer for lease payments to the third party finance company 
our maximum exposure for credit collection under those arrangements as of october  was million 
termination or any material change to the terms of our end user financing arrangements  availability of credit for our customers  including any delay in securing replacement credit sources  or significant financed product repurchase requirements could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results 
distributor financing 
from time to time  we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or facilitation of ownership changes 
as of october  and  we had outstanding notes receivable in the aggregate of million and million  respectively  from two distribution companies 
the amounts are included in other current and long term assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligation less than year years years more than years total long term debt interest payments deferred compensation arrangements purchase obligations operating leases total principal payments in accordance with our long term debt agreements 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements  covering certain current and retired management employees  consists primarily of salary and bonus deferrals under our deferred compensation plans 
our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant elections 
deferred compensation balances are invested according to the election of the participant in an array of funds that is substantially similar to the array of funds offered under the toro company investment  savings and employee stock ownership plan  and are payable at the election of the participant 
operating lease obligations do not include payments to property owners covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance 
as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued  including standby letters of credit  during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we may be obligated for additional cash outflows of million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the payment and timing of any such payments is affected by the ultimate resolution of the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
market risk due to the nature and scope of our operations  we are subject to exposures that arise from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
additional information is presented in part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation  deflation  and changing prices 
during fiscal  we experienced higher average commodity costs compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal  which hampered our gross margin rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal we will continue to closely follow commodities that affect our product lines  and we anticipate average prices paid for commodities to be higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect to mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures by engaging in proactive vendor negotiations  reviewing alternative sourcing options  substituting materials  engaging in internal cost reduction efforts  and increasing prices on some of our products  all as appropriate 
acquisitions and divestiture on june   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of  and assumed certain liabilities from  lawn solutions commercial products  inc lawn solutions  a manufacturer of turf renovation equipment  such as aerators  seeders  power rakes  and brush cutters  for the landscape  rental  municipal  and golf markets

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following warranty reserve 
warranty coverage on our products is generally for specified periods of time and on select products hours of usage  and generally covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs 
warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty reserve by product line for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims 
we also establish reserves for major rework campaigns 
the amount of our warranty reserves is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty  historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims  the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation due to such factors as performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims  our actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
an unexpected increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accrual and a decrease in our net earnings 
sales promotions and incentives 
at the time of sale to a customer  we record an estimate for sales promotion and incentive costs that are classified as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of sg a expense 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include rebate programs on certain professional products sold to distributors  volume discounts  retail financing support  floor planning  cooperative advertising  commissions  and other sales discounts and promotional programs 
the estimates for sales promotion and incentive costs are based on the terms of the arrangements with customers  historical payment experience  field inventory levels  volume purchases  and expectations for changes in relevant trends in the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates if competitive factors dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive accruals or if customer usage and field inventory levels vary from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentive accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of the cost of inventory or net realizable value  with cost determined by either the lifo method for most us inventories or the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
we establish reserves for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life  and forecasted sales demand 
valuation of inventory can also be affected by significant redesign of existing products or replacement of an existing product by an entirely new generation product 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  competitive factors  and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our manufacturing production accordingly 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded based on historical loss trends  ongoing cycle count and periodic testing adjustments  and inventory levels 
though management considers reserve balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have an effect on the reserve balances required 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we value accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
each fiscal quarter  we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable 
we believe that an analysis of historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to sg a expense in the period that we made such a determination 
new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
guidance amended the presentation of comprehensive income to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively 
we will adopt this guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year  as required 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  including a application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  b measurement of the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity  and c quantitative disclosure about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement that is categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the amendments also change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurement and disclosure  including a measurement of the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  b application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and c additional disclosure about fair value measurements 
the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december   and are to be applied prospectively 
we will adopt the amendments of asu no 
at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal year  as required 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our disclosures 
no other new accounting pronouncement that has been issued but not yet effective for us during fiscal has had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
see further discussion on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency exchange rate market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the primary use of forward currency contracts 
additionally  in fiscal  we implemented cross currency swaps to offset intercompany loan exposures 
we use derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes and not for trading purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales to third party customers  sales and loans to wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  foreign plant operations  and purchases from suppliers 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states and mexico  a stronger us dollar and mexican peso generally have a negative impact on our results from operations  while a weaker dollar and peso generally have a positive effect 
our primary currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the mexican peso  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan against the us dollar 
we also have exposure with the romanian new lei against the euro and the us dollar as a result of our new manufacturing facility in romania 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in values of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
further information regarding gains and losses on our derivative instruments is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal and all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet cash flow hedge accounting criteria  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other income expense  net as of and for the fiscal year ended october  were as follows dollars in thousands except average contracted rate average contracted rate notional amount value in aocl income loss fair value impact loss gain buy us sell canadian dollar buy us sell australian dollar buy us sell euro buy us sell british pound buy mexican peso sell us buy british pound sell euro buy swiss franc sell romanian new lei buy euro sell us buy euro sell romanian new lei our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  and would not impact net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to libor based short term debt from commercial banks  as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
we generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying amount of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts and terms of debt could currently be borrowed 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into three treasury lock agreements based on a year us treasury security with a principal balance of million for two of the agreements and million for the third agreement 
these treasury lock agreements provided for a single payment at maturity  which was april   based on the change in value of the reference treasury security 
these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and resulted in a net settlement of million 
this loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and will be amortized to interest expense over the year term of the senior notes 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  aluminum  fuel  petroleum based resin  and linerboard 
in addition  we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  copper  lead  rubber  and others that are integrated into our end products 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
further information regarding rising prices for commodities is presented in part ii  item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report in the section entitled inflation 
we enter into fixed price contracts for future purchases of natural gas in the normal course of operations as a means to manage natural gas price risks 
our manufacturing facilities enter into these fixed price contracts for approximately to percent of their monthly anticipated usage 
equity price risk 
the trading price volatility of our common stock impacts compensation expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
further information is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our stock based compensation plans
