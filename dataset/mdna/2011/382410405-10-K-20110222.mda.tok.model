item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional information on our recent operations in the haynesville shale and eagle ford shale trends 
oil and natural gas reserves in december  the sec adopted new rules related to modernizing reserves definitions and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies  which became effective prospectively for annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the new rules expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons from oil sands  shale  coal beds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas  and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction 
the use of new technologies is now permitted in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
other definitions and terms were revised  including the definition of proved reserves  which was revised to indicate that entities must use the average of beginning of the month commodity prices over the preceding month period  rather than the end of period price  when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce 
likewise  the month average price is now used to estimate reserves utilized to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
another significant provision of the new rules is a requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of initial booking

december  area proved developed proved undeveloped proved reserves of total haynesville shale trend cotton valley taylor sand eagle ford shale trend other total reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the pv amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with the guidelines of the sec  our independent reserve engineers estimates of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves  and the pv and standardized measure thereof  were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions  which requires the use of the month average price for each product  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
the average oil and natural gas prices used in such estimates as of december  were per mmbtu  of natural gas and per bbl of crude oil condensate 
these prices do not include the impact of hedging transactions  nor do they include the adjustments that are made for applicable transportation and quality differentials  and price differentials between natural gas liquids and oil  which are deducted from or added to the index prices on a well by well basis in estimating our proved reserves and related future net revenues 
our proved reserve information as of december  included in this annual report on form k was estimated wholly by our independent petroleum consultant  nsai  in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserve information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
the technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
the company s principal engineer has over years of experience in the oil and gas industry  including over years as a reserve evaluator  trainer or manager 
further professional qualifications of our principal engineer include a degree in petroleum engineering  extensive internal and external reserve training  and experience in asset evaluation and management 
in addition  the principal engineer is an active participant in professional industry groups and has been a member of the society of petroleum engineers for over years 
our estimates of proved reserves are made wholly by netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai  as the company s independent petroleum engineers 
our internal professional staff works closely with our external engineers to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process 
in addition  other pertinent data such as seismic information  geologic maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  well performance data  operating procedures and relevant economic criteria is provided to them

index to financial statements the company considers the best control to ensure compliance with rule of regulation s x for reserve estimates is providing independent fully engineered third party estimate of reserves from a nationally reputable petroleum engineering firm 
while we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process  a preliminary copy of the nsai reserve report is reviewed by our senior management with representatives of nsai and internal technical staff 
additionally  our senior management reviews and approves any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves semi annually 
proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
to achieve reasonable certainty  nsai employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include  but are not limited to  well logs  geologic maps  available downhole and production data  seismic data and well test data 
our proved undeveloped reserves at december   as estimated by nsai  were bcfe  consisting of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of oil and condensate 
in we added approximately bcfe related to the haynesville and cotton valley taylor sand formations  we had revisions of approximately bcfe and we developed approximately bcfe or of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of december  through the drilling of gross net development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately million 
during  we sold oil and natural gas properties which included bcfe of natural gas of proved developed reserves 
none of our proved undeveloped reserves at december  have remained undeveloped for more than five years since the date of initial booking as proved undeveloped reserves  or are scheduled for commencement of development in our december  reserve report on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped 
productive wells the following table sets forth the number of productive wells in which we maintain ownership interests as of december  oil natural gas total gross net gross net gross net south texas east texas northwest louisiana other total productive wells we only engineer royalty and overriding interest wells that have pv large enough to include in the reserve report consequently only wells with royalty and overriding interest are included 
net working interest 
productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production  including gas wells awaiting pipeline connections 
a gross well is a well in which we maintain an ownership interest  while a net well is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional working interests owned by us equals one 
wells that are completed in more than one producing horizon are counted as one well 
of the gross wells reported above  wells had completions in multiple producing horizons

developed undeveloped total gross net gross net gross net south texas east texas northwest louisiana other total undeveloped acreage is considered to be those lease acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the extent that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil  regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we can retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases or by payment of delay rentals during the remaining primary term of such a lease 
the natural gas and oil leases in which we have an interest are for varying primary terms  however  most of our developed lease acreage is beyond the primary term and is held so long as natural gas or oil is produced 
lease expirations our undeveloped acreage  including optioned acreage  expires during the next four years at the rate of  net acres in and  net acres in   net acres in and net acres in  unless included in producing units or extended prior to lease expiration 
substantially all of the lease expirations are within the cotton and cotton south fields where the company recently sold all of its shallow rights and where it has no current plans to drill any deep wells

oil and gas marketing and major customers marketing 
essentially all of our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our condensate and crude oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant 
revenues from the largest of these sources as a percent of oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  was as follows louis dreyfus corporation shell energy competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
employees at february   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and one field office  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection  and well testing 
regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 

table of contents 
index to financial statements environmental matters general our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling and production activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit some or all of our operations 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws to which our business operations are subject and with which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
hazardous substances and wastes the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liabilities for remediation costs at the site  natural resource damages and for the costs of certain health studies 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion under rcra from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  these wastes may be regulated by the us environmental protection agency the epa and state environmental agencies as non hazardous solid wastes 
moreover  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
the epa and state agencies have imposed stringent requirements for the disposal of hazardous and solid wastes 
we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
water discharges the federal water pollution control act  as amended  clean water act  and analogous state law  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into state and federal waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liabilities for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages including natural reservoir damages arising from a spill 
the disposal of oil and gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the safe drinking water act as well as analogous state laws 
under part c of the safe drinking water act  the epa established the underground injection control program  which establishes requirements for permitting  testing  monitoring  recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water 
state programs may have analogous permitting and operational requirements 
any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater  potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well  issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies  incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource  and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injury 
in addition to the underground injection operations  our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance any production of natural gas from formations with low permeability  such as shales 
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
however  the epa recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the safe drinking water act s underground injunction program 
while the epa has yet to take any action to enforce or implement this newly asserted regulatory authority  industry groups have filed suit challenging the epa s recent decision 
at the same time  the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and a committee of the us house of representatives is conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
in addition  legislation was proposed in the recently completed session of congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process  and such legislation could be introduced in the current session of congress 
moreover  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such legal requirements could increase our costs of compliance  impose operational delays  and make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing  resulting in reduced amounts of oil and natural gas being produced 
air emissions the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants from many sources in the united states  including crude oil and natural gas production activities 
these laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  impose stringent air permit requirements  or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements climate change 
in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes  the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also trigger construction and operating permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources  effective january  the epa has published its final rule to address the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting programs  pursuant to which these permitting programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
the epa s rules relating to emissions of ghgs from large stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the epa from implementing or requiring state environmental agencies to implement the rules 
on november   the epa published a final rule expanding its existing ghg emissions reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas processing  transmission  storage  and distribution activities  which may include certain of our operations  beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances  with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
these allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time 
the adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of ghgs or otherwise limits emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production interests and operations 
endangered species the federal endangered species act and analogous state laws restrict activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species or their habitats 
while some of our operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species 
in these areas  we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species  and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons  such as breeding and nesting seasons  when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species 
it is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to our activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species 
the presence of protected species or the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 
employee health and safety we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and citizens 

table of contents 
index to financial statements other laws and regulations state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field

our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by nsai  our independent reserve engineers  and were calculated using the unweighted average of first day of the month oil and gas prices in these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed during reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves 
table of contents 
index to financial statements attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pv  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
our operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations 
our domestic operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal  state  tribal  local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  permitting  changes in taxes  deductions  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies or price gathering rate controls 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  tribal and local governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws  including tax laws  and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the united states congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
the united states congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as us  that participate in that market 
the new legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act  was signed into law by the president on july  and requires the commodities futures trading commission the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
in its rulemaking under the act  the cftc has proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents 
certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits 
it is not possible at this time to predict when the cftc will finalize these regulations 
the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities  although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
finally  the legislation was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation 
legislation has been proposed that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us federal income tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock 
our operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  health and safety aspects of our operations  or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits  including drilling permits  before conducting regulated activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to strict  joint and several liabilities for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste control  handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations  competitive position or financial condition

index to financial statements climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment  the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also may trigger prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permit requirements for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january  the epa rules have tailored the psd and title v permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities 
the epa also published a final rule on november  expanding its existing ghg emissions reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas processing  transmission  storage  and distribution activities  which may include certain of our operations  beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
the adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of ghgs or otherwise limits emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
however  due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality  the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and a committee of the us house of representatives is conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
in addition  legislation was proposed in the recently completed session of congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process  and such legislation could be introduced in the current session of congress 
moreover  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such legal requirements could increase our costs of compliance  impose operational delays  and make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing  resulting in reduced amounts of oil and natural gas being produced 
our estimates of proved reserves have been prepared under sec rules which went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december   which may make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 
this report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of december   which have been prepared and presented under sec rules 
these rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   and require sec reporting companies to prepare their reserves estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on twelve month unweighted first day of the month average pricing 
the previous rules required that reserve estimates be calculated using last day of the year pricing 
the pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of december  and was based on an unweighted average twelve month

index to financial statements west texas intermediate wti posted price of per bbl for oil and a henry hub spot price of per mmbtu for natural gas  as compared to per bbl for oil and per mmbtu for natural gas as of december  as a result of these changes  direct comparisons of our reserves amounts under the rules may be more difficult 
another impact of the sec rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
this rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program  particularly as we develop our significant acreage in shale plays in east texas  northwest louisiana and south texas 
moreover  we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those reserves within the required five year timeframe 
the sec has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific future sec interpretive guidance 
our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  mechanical difficulties  and risks associated with horizontal drilling 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
in addition  while lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  higher oil and gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increasing costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages 
table of contents 
index to financial statements could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  a sustained decrease in the price of natural gas or oil would adversely impact our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 
natural gas and crude oil prices are extremely volatile 
average natural gas and oil prices varied substantially during the past few years 
any actual or anticipated reduction in natural gas and crude oil and prices may further depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
prices for natural gas increased slightly in but still have remained low when compared with average prices in prior years 
these lower prices  coupled with the slow recovery in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital  have compelled most natural gas and oil producers  including us  to reduce the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
this will have a significant effect on our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
any sustained reductions in natural gas and oil prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
a reduction in our reserves could have other adverse consequences including a possible downward redetermination of the availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility  which would restrict our liquidity 
additionally  further or continued declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment write downs 
any such writedown could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
our use of gas and oil price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our natural gas and oil production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
we hedged approximately of our total production volumes for the year ended december  our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our commodity derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil 
for the years ended december  and  we realized a gain on settled natural gas derivatives of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on settled commodity derivatives of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized gain resulting in a total gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for

for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss resulting in a total gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for we account for our natural gas and oil derivatives using fair value accounting standards 
each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value 
additionally  changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swaps and collars and  as such  all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings 
our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception 
contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark to market accounting treatment 
in the future  we will be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 
see note derivative activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed  and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
if we are unable to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain particularly because we may chose not to develop such reserves on anticipated schedules in future adverse oil or natural gas price environments 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
furthermore  any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments related to oil and gas properties of million  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area 
essentially all of our estimated proved reserves at december   and all our production during were associated with our northwest louisiana  east texas and south texas properties which include the haynesville shale and eagle ford shale  respectfully 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention including potential regulation or limitation of the use of high pressure fracture stimulation techniques in these formations or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
for example  chesapeake and matador resources company operate certain properties in the haynesville shale 
we have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions 
we operate primarily in the northwest louisiana  east texas and south texas areas 
northwest louisiana and east texas is in the same geographic region as the haynesville shale 
a number of companies are currently operating in the haynesville shale 
if drilling in the haynesville shale and eagle ford shale continues to be successful  the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for the northwest louisiana and east texas may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines 
in such event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or that we currently project  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
on february   we entered into a third amendment to our senior credit facility revising our interest coverage ratio from x to x to take into consideration additional non cash interest related to the adoption of apb in december our senior credit facility contains customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our senior credit facility 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
in addition  our current senior credit facility matures in august any replacement credit facility may have more restrictive covenants or provide us with less borrowing capacity 
we will need to obtain additional borrowings or other funding in the event holders of our million convertible senior notes due require us to purchase some or all of the notes on december  holders of our million principal amount convertible senior notes due have the right to require us to purchase some or all of such notes at par on december  because the conversion price of those notes is substantially above recent trading price of our common stock  it is more likely that notes will be put to us for repurchase on such date 
accordingly  we must incur additional borrowings or seek other sources of funding to repay any such notes that are required to be repurchased 
these additional borrowings may be on terms less favorable than our current indebtedness or may be subject to more restrictive covenants 
obtaining funding from other sources  such as the sale or participation of some of our properties or assets  could have an adverse impact on our capital spending for exploration and development 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are in exact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing 
we may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
as is common in the oil and natural gas industry  we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 
terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september   and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital
