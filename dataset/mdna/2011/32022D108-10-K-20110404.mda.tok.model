eesa also increased fdic deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase is in place until december  and is not covered by deposit insurance premiums paid by the banking industry 
temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on october  the tlgp includes the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through december  for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts and certain funds swept into noninterest bearing savings accounts 
institutions participating in the tagp pay a basis points fee annualized on the balance of each covered account in excess of  while the extra deposit insurance is in place 
the tlgp also includes the debt guarantee program dgp  under which the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
the unsecured debt must be issued on or after october  and not later than october   and the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june  or  for certain insured institutions  of their liabilities as of september  depending on the term of the debt maturity  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized for covered debt outstanding until the earlier of maturity or june  the tagp and dgp are in effect for all eligible entities  unless the entity opted out on or before december  first financial service corporation s bank subsidiary elected to participate in the tagp and both the bank subsidiary and the holding company are eligible to participate in dgp 
certificate of deposit account registry service 
to mitigate the risks associated with carrying balances in excess of federally insured limits  we are participating in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
cdars is a system that allows certificates of deposit that would be in excess of fdic coverage in a single financial institution to be redistributed to other financial institutions within the cdars network in increments under the current fdic coverage limit 
consequently  the full amount of the certificates of deposit becomes eligible for fdic protection 
even though we have deposits that will remain in the cdars network  those deposits are considered brokered deposits and the bank s troubled institution designation prevents us from accepting  renewing or rolling over brokered deposits 
therefore  as long as the consent order remains in effect  we will be able to retain only our deposits within the cdars network that do not come up for renewal or roll over 
american recovery and reinvestment act 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future cpp recipients  including first financial service corporation  until the institution has repaid the treasury 
arra also permits cpp participants to redeem the preferred shares held by the treasury department without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
dodd frank act 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act was signed into law on july  the dodd frank act is intended to effect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation 
among other things  the dodd frank act creates a new financial stability oversight council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms 
the dodd frank act additionally creates a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws 

table of contents it is difficult to predict at this time what impact the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks like the bank  including the lending and credit practices of such banks 
moreover  many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for several months  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those provisions relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau will increase our operating and compliance costs and restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the dodd frank act is expected to have a significant impact on the corporation s business operations as its provisions take effect 
among the provisions that are likely to affect the corporation are the following corporate governance 
the dodd frank act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so called golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions 
the new legislation also authorizes the sec to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
additionally  the dodd frank act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of billion  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
the dodd frank act gives the sec authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters 
transactions with affiliates and insiders 
the dodd frank act will apply section a and section h of the federal reserve act governing transactions with insiders to derivative transactions  repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider 
any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured 
the current exemption from section a for transactions with financial subsidiaries will be eliminated 
the dodd frank act will additionally prohibit an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and  if representing more than of capital  is approved in advance by the disinterested directors 
consumer financial protection bureau 
the dodd frank act creates a new  independent federal agency called the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  which is granted broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws  including the ecoa  tila  respa  fcra  fair debt collection act  the consumer financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act glba and certain other statutes 
the cfpb will have examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with billion or more in assets 
smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the cfpb  but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes 
the cfpb will have authority to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 
the dodd frank act authorizes the cfpb to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay 
in addition  the dodd frank act will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the cfpb 
the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and  in certain circumstances  permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations 
federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements  traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter  has also been modified by the dodd frank act and now requires a case by case determination of preemption by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank 
depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard  the operations of the bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates 

table of contents deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and extends unlimited deposit insurance to non interest bearing transaction accounts through december  the dodd frank act also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to of insured deposits by and eliminates the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act also eliminates the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts 
capital 
under the dodd frank act  the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than billion of assets 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
uncertainty remains as to ultimate impact of the dodd frank act  but the board and management anticipates that the provisions summarized above  as well as others set forth in the dodd frank act  could have an adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and our business  results of operations and financial condition

risk factors the risks identified below  as well as in the other cautionary statements made throughout this report  identify factors that could materially and adversely affect our business  future results of operations  and future cash flows 
if we continue to incur significant losses  it may be difficult to continue in operation without additional capital 
we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of million in and million in  for a two year total of million 
the net loss for was due in part to a million deferred tax valuation allowance 
the net loss for was due in part to an million non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge 
provisions for loan losses and investment impairments also contributed to our losses 
during and  we recorded total provisions for loan losses of million and other than temporary losses on investments of million 
while our losses also included a charge off of goodwill of million  and a charge to establish an allowance against the realization of our deferred tax asset of million  these latter charges were largely influenced by the losses on loans and investments 
we could be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and impairments to investments if asset values continue to decline in the current economic climate 
this in turn may require the corporation to raise additional capital to fund the bank s operations so that the bank can sustain such losses without capital levels decreasing below the minimum levels set forth in the consent order 
see part i  item business recent developments  for a description of the bank s capital requirements set forth in the consent order 
we are subject to a consent order with the fdic and the kdfi and a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve that restrict the conduct of our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our good standing with bank regulatory agencies is of fundamental importance to the continuation of our businesses 
in january  the bank agreed to a consent order by the fdic and kdfi by which the bank agreed to develop and implement actions to reduce the amount of classified assets and improve earnings 
compliance with the consent order will increase our operating expense  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
any material failures to comply with the consent order would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the fdic and kdfi  which could damage the reputation of the bank and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the provisions of the consent order are outlined above in the recent developments section 
in december  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis 
pursuant to the memorandum  we made informal commitments including  among other things  to use our financial and management resources to assist the bank in addressing weaknesses identified by the fdic and kdfi 
following our agreement to the consent order with the fdic and kdfi  we were notified that the federal reserve bank of st 
louis expects to enter into a similar formal agreement with the corporation 
any material failures to comply with the agreement would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the federal reserve which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to pay cash dividends on our common and preferred stock and pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures that relate to our trust preferred securities is currently restricted 
our inability to resume paying dividends and distributions on these securities may adversely affect our common shareholders 
we historically paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock until we suspended dividend payments in december during the third quarter of  we also suspended cash dividends on the treasury preferred stock and have begun deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes relating to our trust preferred securities 
deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes will result in a deferral of distributions on our trust preferred securities 
future payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future payment on treasury preferred stock will be subject to the prior payment of all unpaid dividends on the treasury preferred stock and all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
if we miss six quarterly dividend payments on the treasury preferred stock  whether or not consecutive  the treasury 
table of contents department will have the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
dividends on the treasury preferred stock and deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities are cumulative and therefore unpaid dividends and distributions will accrue and compound on each subsequent payment date 
if we become subject to any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of affairs  holders of the trust preferred securities and then holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive the liquidation amounts to which they are entitled including the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions and dividends  before any distribution to the holders of common stock 
we need to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the bank has agreed with the fdic and the kdfi to develop a plan to increase its tier one leverage ratio to and its total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets to by march  the bank also agreed to develop a plan to increase its tier one leverage ratio to and its total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets to by june  we are evaluating various specific initiatives to increase our regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets 
strategic alternatives include divesting of branch offices  selling loans  raising capital by selling stock  and seeking a business combination transaction 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
we may not have access to capital on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
future sales of our common stock or other securities will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
we are currently evaluating strategies to meet our capital needs and regulatory requirements 
these strategies may result in the issuance of additional common shares 
we can issue common shares without shareholder approval  up to the number of authorized shares set forth in our articles of incorporation 
our board of directors may determine to seek additional capital through the issuance and sale of common shares  preferred shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares  subject to limitations imposed by the nasdaq stock market and the federal reserve 
we may not be able to issue common shares at prices or on terms better than or equal to the prices and terms on which our current shareholders acquired their shares 
our future issuance of any additional common shares or other securities may have the effect of reducing the book value or market price of then outstanding common shares 
our issuance of additional common or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our existing shareholders 
in addition  if our shareholders sell a substantial number of our common shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares in the public market  or if there is a perception that such sales are likely to occur  it could cause the market price of our common shares to continue declining 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that either future sales of a substantial volume of our common shares in the market  or the potential for large volumes of sales in the market  would have on the market price of our common shares 
however  if the market price of our common shares declines  it could impair our ability to raise capital through sales of stock 
we cannot guarantee whether such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain future financing  we may not have the capital and financial resources needed to operate our business or to meet regulatory requirements 
ongoing market developments may continue to adversely affect our industry  businesses and results of operations 
since mid  the financial services industry as a whole has been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
concerns about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties have caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers including financial institutions 

table of contents the lack of available credit  loss of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity have materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects that these difficult market conditions have had on us and others in the financial services industry 
sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in our markets has had and could continue to have the following adverse effects on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services that we offer  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  an increase in the number of clients who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
higher numbers of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults have resulted in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
overall  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business in recent years  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve in the near term 
until conditions improve  we expect our businesses  financial condition and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected 
if we cannot borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
if our liquidity policies and strategies don t work as well as intended  then we may be unable to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
our asset liability committee follows established board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
as long as the consent order remains in effect  the bank will not be able to rely on brokered deposits including deposits through the cdars program for its liquidity needs 
the designation of the bank as a troubled institution in connection with the issuance of the consent order prohibits the bank from accepting new brokered deposits or renewing or rolling over any existing brokered deposits at the bank 
the bank is also restricted in the amount of interest it may pay on core deposits 
see part i  item i business regulation regulatory capital requirements for a description of the bank s interest rate restrictions 
the bank s designation as a troubled institution may also limit the amount of additional advances available from the fhlb 
the bank currently does not have any additional borrowing capacity under its fhlb line of credit 
the corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank 
historically  the corporation has received substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from the bank 
regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us 
recent losses have had the consequence of not allowing the bank to pay any dividends to the corporation without prior regulatory approval 
the corporation has no other sources of revenue 
at december  the corporation had liquidity in the form of cash of  we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other available sources of liquidity  including the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might not be able to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our 
table of contents level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our decisions regarding credit risk may not be accurate  and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe is adequate to absorb any probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio based on historical loan loss experience  specific problem loans  value of underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
if our assessment of these factors is ultimately inaccurate  the allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which would require us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results 
our estimates are subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events 
changes in economic  operating and other conditions that are generally beyond our control could cause the financial condition of our borrowers to deteriorate and our actual loan losses to increase significantly 
bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
regulatory agencies have required us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs when their judgment has differed from ours  and they may do so in the future  which could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of loans collateralized by real estate 
approximately of our loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate 
an adverse change in the economy that depresses values of real estate generally or in our primary markets such as we have recently experienced could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
when real estate values decline  it becomes more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses as we did in and if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses  it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments  financial performance and capital 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other than temporary impairment of our securities  taking into consideration current market conditions  the extent and nature of change in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  volatility of earnings  current analysts evaluations  our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value  as well as other factors 
adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other than temporarily impaired  with the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to earnings 
recent market volatility has made it extremely difficult to value certain securities 
subsequent valuations  in light of factors prevailing at that time  may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods 
any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
because most of our business activities are conducted in central kentucky and adjacent counties of indiana  and most of our credit exposure is in that region  we are at risk from adverse economic or business developments affecting this area  including declining regional and local business activity  a downturn in real estate values and agricultural activities and natural disasters 
to the extent the central kentucky economy further declines  the rates of delinquencies  foreclosures  bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase 
moreover  the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be adversely affected by economic downturn or a localized natural disaster 
an economic downturn or other events that 
table of contents affect our markets could  therefore  result in losses that may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our small to medium sized business target market may have fewer resources to weather the downturn in the economy 
our strategy includes lending to small and medium sized businesses and other commercial enterprises 
small and medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial variations in operating results  any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small and medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay our loan 
economic downturns and other events could have a more pronounced negative impact on our target market  which could cause us to incur substantial credit losses that could materially harm our operating results 
our profitability is vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  and money supply may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities in a given period  as a result of decreasing interest rates  our net interest income may decrease 
likewise  our net interest income may decrease if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in the current low interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates  which could reduce net interest income and harm our results of operations 
we face strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service companies  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with other financial institutions in attracting deposits and making loans 
our competition in attracting deposits comes principally from commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds 
competition in making loans in the louisville metropolitan area has increased in recent years after changes in banking law allowed several banks to enter the market by establishing new branches 
likewise  competition is increasing in our other markets  which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our market share 
competition in the banking industry may also limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients 
we maintain smaller staffs of associates and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which we compete 
financial institutions that have far greater resources and greater efficiencies than we do may have several marketplace advantages resulting from their ability to offer higher interest rates on deposits and lower interest rates on loans than we can  offer a broader range of services than we do  maintain numerous branch locations  and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 

table of contents in addition  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and other financial intermediaries may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are and may have larger lending limits than we do 
some of our current commercial banking clients may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than we can accommodate 
if we are unable to attract and retain customers  we may not be able to maintain growth and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and  as a result  are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to implement our growth and operating strategies 
we are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies  which is described under item business regulation 
regulatory oversight of banks is primarily intended to protect depositors  the federal deposit insurance funds  and the banking system as a whole  not our shareholders 
compliance with these regulations is costly and may make it more difficult to operate profitably 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern numerous matters including the payment of dividends  the acquisition of other banks and the establishment of new banking offices 
we must also meet specific regulatory capital requirements 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and policies or to maintain our capital requirements affects our ability to pay dividends on common stock  our ability to grow through the development of new offices and our ability to make acquisitions 
we currently may not pay a dividend from the bank to the corporation without the prior written consent of our primary banking regulators  which limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
these limitations may also prevent us from successfully implementing our growth and operating strategies 
in addition  the laws and regulations applicable to banks could change at any time  which could significantly impact our business and profitability 
for example  new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which we may conduct our business  including our ability to attract deposits and make loans 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy or insolvency of a prominent us corporation  can cause legislators and banking regulators and other agencies such as the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the public company accounting oversight board and various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
changes in regulation may cause us to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance  which may negatively affect our operating results 
recent financial reform legislation could have a material effect on our future operations 
the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act institutes a wide range of reforms that will have an impact on all financial institutions 
the dodd frank act changes the deposit insurance and financial regulatory systems  enhances bank capital requirements and requires new regulations to protect consumers in financial transactions  among other things 
many of these provisions require rule making and studies that will be conducted in the future 
for these reasons  we cannot assess the impact the dodd frank act may have on us at the present time 
our issuance of securities to the us department of the treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares 
in addition  the dividend rate increases substantially after five years if we cannot redeem the shares by that time 
on january   as part of the capital purchase program established by the us department of the treasury under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  we sold million of senior preferred stock to the department of the treasury 
we also issued to the department of the treasury a warrant to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at per share 
the terms of the transaction with the department of the treasury limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares 
for three years after issuance or until the department of the treasury no longer holds any preferred shares  we will not be able to increase our dividends above the most recent level before october  
per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our shares without the department of the treasury s approval with limited exceptions  most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans 

table of contents also  we will not be able to pay any dividends at all unless we are current on our dividend payments on the preferred shares 
these restrictions  as well as the dilutive impact of the warrant  may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock during the first five years  the dividends on this capital will increase substantially at that point  from approximately million annually to approximately million annually 
depending on market conditions and our financial performance at the time  this increase in dividends could significantly impact our capital and liquidity 
the us department of the treasury has the unilateral ability to change some of the restrictions imposed on us by virtue of our sale of securities to it 
our agreement with the us department of the treasury under which it purchased our securities imposes restrictions on our conduct of our business  including restrictions related to our payment of dividends and repurchase of our stock and related to our executive compensation and governance 
the us department of the treasury has the right under this agreement to unilaterally amend it to the extent required to comply with any future changes in federal statutes 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of amended provisions of eesa relating to compensation and governance as they affect companies that have sold securities to the us department of the treasury 
in some cases  these amendments require action by the us department of the treasury to implement them 
these amendments could have an adverse impact on the conduct of our business  as could additional amendments in the future that impose further requirements or amend existing requirements 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses from operational risk in the future 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk  which could cause us to incur substantial losses 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
nevertheless  we experience loss from operational risk from time to time  including the effects of operational errors  and these losses may be substantial

table of contents item managements s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview the unfavorable economic conditions that have persisted since continued to significantly impact the banking industry and our performance during during we continued to experience an increase in our non performing assets and loan loss provisions 
our decline in credit quality impacted our operations during in the areas of net interest income  provision for loans losses  non interest income  non interest expense  and reversals of tax benefits 
our net loss attributable to common shareholders for was million  or per diluted common share compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share in the results include provision for loans losses of million  other than temporary securities impairment of million  write downs on other real estate owned of million  an increase in fdic insurance expense of  and a charge to establish an allowance against the realization of our deferred tax asset of million 
the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to residential housing development loans in jefferson and oldham counties 
five individual loan relationships totaling million make up of our non performing assets 
four of these relationships totaling million represent of our non performing loans 
these high end subdivisions  while showing initial progress  have stalled due to the recession 
at december   substantially all of the residential housing development loan portfolio concentration in these counties has been classified as impaired 
the provision for loan loss expense exceeded net charge offs by million 
the allowance to total loans was at december  while net charge offs totaled basis points for  compared to basis points in non performing loans were million  or of total loans at december  compared to million  or of total loans for december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  non performing assets increased to million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets at december  net interest income was million for compared to million for  while the net interest margin was for compared to in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a higher level of non accrual loans and due to our efforts to increase liquidity by placing assets into lower yielding investments other than loans 
non interest income decreased  primarily driven by an increase of  in the loss on sale and write downs on real estate acquired through foreclosure for offsetting this increase was an increase in the gain on the sale mortgage loans of  non interest expense decreased million primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million taken in the expenses include increases in fdic insurance premiums of  and other real estate owned costs of million 
despite our recent losses  we remained well capitalized at december  under regulatory capital guidelines 
although  subsequent to december   we were classified as a troubled institution and cannot be considered well capitalized under that designation 
in  as part of an informal regulatory agreement with the fdic  the bank agreed to maintain a tier leverage ratio of 
at december   we were not in compliance with the tier capital requirement 
on january   the bank entered into a consent order  a formal agreement with the fdic and kdfi  under which  among other things  the bank has agreed to achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least by march  and by june  a copy of the consent order is set forth as exhibit of the form k filed with the sec on january  the consent order supersedes the prior informal regulatory agreement 

table of contents in order to meet these capital requirements  the board of directors and management are continuing to evaluate strategies including the following raising capital by selling capital stock through a public offering or private placement 
continuing to operate the company and the bank in a safe and sound manner 
until we can complete a capital raise  this will most likely require us to reduce lending concentrations  potentially sell loans  and take significant operating expense reductions and other cost cutting measures aimed at lowering expenses 
additionally  we would adjust the mix of our assets to reduce the total risk weight of our assets  reduce total assets over time and potentially sell branches  deposits and loans 
evaluating other strategic alternatives  such as a sale of assets  one or more branches  or the institution 
bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order 
the agencies may initiate changes in management  issue mandatory directives  impose monetary penalties or refrain from formal sanctions  depending on individual circumstances 
over the past several years we have focused on enhancing and expanding our retail and commercial banking network in our core central kentucky markets as well as establishing our presence in the metropolitan louisville market 
our core markets  where we have a combined market share  have become increasingly competitive as several new banks have entered those markets during the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we have replaced existing branches with newer  enhanced facilities 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with more power to make decisions locally 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to a high level of customer service will enhance our market share in our core markets and our development in the louisville market 
although we had a disappointing year in our loan portfolio  we believe that the strength of our retail franchise will enhance our ability to persevere through this economic recovery 
this is evidenced by our total deposits increasing million  or for  continuing the momentum from where we achieved a record growth year in the amount of million  or a increase in total deposits over growth in deposits  coupled with positive signs of economic growth in our home markets  which is fueled by the ft 
knox base realignment  will provide a sound basis for us as the local economy recovers 
while our concerns about economic conditions in our market continue  opportunities for deposit growth helps us progress towards our long range financial objectives  including building additional core customer relationships  maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital levels  improving shareholder value and remediating our problem assets 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan loss review committee  which is comprised of senior officers  evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio depend more on credit analysis and recent payment 
table of contents performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate required a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for the period 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could materially increase 
impairment of investment securities we review all unrealized losses on our investment securities to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
we evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant  to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
we evaluate a number of factors including  but not limited to valuation estimates provided by investment brokers  how much fair value has declined below amortized cost  how long the decline in fair value has existed  the financial condition of the issuer  significant rating agency changes on the issuer  and management s assessment that we do not intend to sell or will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the possibility for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and a charge to earnings is recognized for the credit component and the non credit component is recorded to other comprehensive income 
real estate owned the estimation of fair value is significant to real estate owned acquired through foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of cost or the fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets when available 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income loss as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
an assessment is made as to whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized 
during  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our deferred tax asset and recorded a million valuation allowance 
results of operation net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in contributing to the net loss for was a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase of million in provision for loan losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million write downs taken on investment securities that were 
table of contents other than temporarily impaired  write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  and higher fdic insurance premiums 
net loss attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends paid on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in earnings decreased for compared to due to a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase in provision for loan loss expense  write downs taken on investment securities that were other than temporarily impaired  write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  higher fdic insurance premiums  a goodwill impairment charge and higher operating expenses 
net income attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends paid on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
the increase in the volume of interest earning assets was off set by the change in the mix of interest earning assets  causing a negative impact on net interest income  which decreased  for compared to a year ago 
average interest earning assets increased million for compared to the increase was primarily attributed to our efforts to increase liquidity which resulted in an increase of lower yielding investments  interest bearing deposits and cash 
the result was a shift in the mix of assets with the addition of lower yielding assets lowering our net interest margin 
net interest margin was also negatively impacted by the increase in the amount of non accrual loans 
the yield on earning assets averaged for compared to an average yield on earning assets of for this decrease was offset somewhat by a decrease in our cost of funds 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased basis points to for compared to for the period 
our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in competition for deposits combined with continued re pricing of variable rate loans and our efforts to increase liquidity by placing assets into lower yielding investments other than loans is likely to compress our net interest margin in future quarters

we opened a full service banking center at fort knox and another in the middletown area of jefferson county in outside services and data processing decreased due the renewal of our data processing contracts at a lower monthly cost 
during the fourth quarter of  the fdic adopted a requirement that all banks prepay three and a quarter years worth of fdic assessments on december  the prepayment is based on average third quarter deposits 
the prepaid amount will be amortized over the prepayment period 
our prepayment was million of which million was reflected in our income statement 
because the bank entered into the consent order and is designated a troubled institution it is in a higher risk category and now pays one of the highest deposit assessment rates 
the second largest expense incurred in was a goodwill impairment charge of million 
annual analysis of goodwill indicated an impairment charge was necessary due to continued market deterioration 
while this charge flows through our income statement  it is a non cash item that does not impact our liquidity or adversely affect regulatory or tangible capital ratios 

table of contents the increase in real estate acquired through foreclosure expense for and was primarily due to increase in expense relating to repair  maintenance and taxes due to increases in real estate we acquired through foreclosure and due to  in back taxes being paid on a commercial real estate property that was taken into other real estate owned for our efficiency ratio was for compared to for the period 
the ratio excludes goodwill impairment 
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million in  as compared to income tax benefit of million in  and expense of million in the recognition of income tax expense in resulted mainly from a non cash charge of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax rate is related primarily to the loss generated from the goodwill impairment as a portion of this goodwill arose from a taxable business combination 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the size of our operating loss relative to income tax expense recorded resulting from a charge to establish a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required when it is considered more likely than not that all or part of the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including our three year cumulative loss position and the fact that we did not meet our forecast levels in that we set in the fourth quarter of due to higher levels of provision for loan loss expense 
recording a valuation allowance does not have any impact on our liquidity  nor does it preclude us from using the tax losses  tax credits or other timing differences in the future 
to the extent that we generate taxable income in a given quarter  the valuation allowance may be reduced to fully or partially offset the corresponding income tax expense 
any remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed through income tax expense once we can demonstrate a sustainable return to profitability and conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be utilized prior to expiration 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our income taxes 
analysis of financial condition total assets at december  increased to billion compared to billion at december  the increase was due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and building our investment portfolio to million  an increase of million since december  this increase was mainly off set by a decline in gross loans  excluding loans held for sale  of million 
this shift in the balance sheet reflects a conscious effort by management to add on balance sheet liquidity to protect us against any adverse changes to our current wholesale funding position 
loans net loans decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  our commercial real estate and commercial portfolios decreased million to million at december  our residential mortgage loan  real estate construction and indirect consumer portfolios all decreased for the period while our consumer and home equity loan portfolio increased million 
the decline in our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios is a result of pay offs and charge offs on several large commercial relationships 
the loan portfolio also declined due to our aggressive efforts to resolve problem loans 
during  we took deeds in lieu of foreclosure on several large commercial real estate properties  moving them to our other real estate owned portfolio 
although there remains a high demand for loans from quality borrowers  we have elected to shift our focus to preserve capital 
we believe  however  we will still be well positioned to benefit from growth in our local markets as the economy rebounds

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 

table of contents the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses monthly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the committee determines the allowance by applying loss estimates to graded loans by categories  as described below 
in addition  the committee analyzes such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
further declines in collateral values  including commercial real estate  may impact our ability to collect on certain loans when borrowers are dependent on the values of the real estate as a source of cash flow 
during the second half of  and continuing throughout  we substantially increased our provision for loan losses for our general and specific reserves as we identified adverse conditions 
the foreseeable future will continue to be a challenging time for our financial institution as we manage the overall level of our credit quality 
it is likely that provision for loan losses will remain elevated in the near term 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we entered into a consent order with bank regulatory agencies 
in addition to increasing capital ratios  we agreed to maintain adequate reserves for loan losses  develop and implement a plan to reduce the level of non performing assets through collection  disposition  charge off or improvement in the credit quality of the loans  develop and implement a plan to reduce concentrations of credit in commercial real estate loans  implement revised credit risk management practices and credit administration policies and procedures and to report our progress to the regulators

table of contents the provision for loan losses increased million to million in compared to the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to residential housing development loans in jefferson and oldham counties 
during  we continued our efforts to ensure the adequacy of the allowance by adding specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
we require appraisals on real estate at the time of initial application and subsequently assess the transaction and market conditions to determine if updated appraisals are periodically needed 
additionally  we evaluate the collateral condition and value upon classification as an impaired loan and upon foreclosure 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve provisioning levels for commercial real estate loans due to the increase in classified loans for the period 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million from december  to december  the increase was due to specific reserves placed on loans due to updated appraisal information obtained as part of our on going monitoring of the loan portfolio  as well as the provision recorded to reflect an increase in classified loans for the period 
specific reserves as allocated to substandard loans made up of the total allowance for loan loss at december  the increase in charge offs for was primarily attributed to charging down previously recorded specific reserves on non performing loans whose condition worsened during the provision for loan losses increased by million to million in compared to the increase was partially related to growth in the loan portfolio  but primarily from the specific reserves set aside for loans classified during and increases in general reserve provisioning levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we added specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve factors for commercial real estate loans during the period as the level of classified loans has increased sharply since the allowance for loan losses increased million to million from december  to december  the increase was due to an increase in net loans for  as well as the provision recorded to reflect a million increase in classified loans for the period 
the increase in charge offs for the period was primarily attributed to a charge down of million on one large commercial real estate relationship that we foreclosed on during the second quarter of million of the million charge down was previously reserved during the prior year 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we took a write down of  on a commercial real estate relationship that was classified and recorded a charge off of  on another commercial real estate relationship 
additionally  charge offs were generally higher in all areas of the loan portfolio for the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors 
since these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not a prediction of future portfolio performance

dollars in thousands december  december  december  criticized loans total criticized    classified loans substandard    doubtful loss  total classified    total criticized and classified    as we focused on credit quality during  and  there was a significant migration of loans into the substandard loan category 
if economic conditions continue to put stress on our borrowers going forward  this may require higher provisions for loan losses in future periods 
credit quality will continue to be a primary focus during and going forward 
the million increase in substandard assets for was primarily the result of downgrading loans with thirteen borrowers with balances ranging from million to million 
offsetting this increase was the transfer of five classified loans totaling million to real estate acquired through foreclosure  the upgrades of three classified loans totaling million whose cash flow is adequate to service the debt and a million pay down on another commercial real estate loan 
approximately million  or of the total classified loans were related to real estate development or real estate construction loans in our market area 
several of the non performing loans that were added during the period were adequately collateralized and therefore did not require additional reserves 
classified consumer loans totaled million  classified mortgage loans totaled million and classified commercial loans totaled million 
the change in our level of allowance for loan losses is a result of a consistent allowance methodology that is driven by risk ratings 
for more information on collection efforts  evaluation of collateral and how loss amounts are estimated  see non performing assets  below 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans longer than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
if a loan is impaired  we allocate a portion of the allowance so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel 

table of contents we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosure is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
we monitor market information and the age of appraisals on existing real estate owned properties and obtain new appraisals as circumstances warrant 
real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million to million at december  the increase was primarily the result of foreclosures on residential housing development loans in jefferson and oldham counties involving nine commercial real estate properties totaling million that were transferred during offsetting this increase was the sale of four commercial real estate properties totaling million 
we anticipate that our level of real estate acquired through foreclosure will remain at elevated levels for some period of time as foreclosures reflecting both weak economic conditions and soft commercial real estate values continue 
all properties held in other real estate owned are listed for sale with various independent real estate agents 
a summary of the real estate acquired through foreclosure activity is as follows

december  dollar in thousands restructured      past due days still on accrual loans on non accrual status    total non performing loans    real estate acquired through foreclosure   other repossessed assets total non performing assets    interest income that would have been earned on non performing loans interest income recognized on non performing loans ratios non performing loans to total loans excluding loans held for sale non performing assets to total loans excluding loans held for sale 
table of contents non performing loans increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  our exposure to residential subdivision developments in jefferson and oldham counties was the primary cause of the increase in non performing loans and non performing assets for and at december   substantially all of the residential housing development loan portfolio concentration in these counties has been classified as impaired 
the remaining credits in this concentration are smaller credits with strong guarantor strength 
five individual loan relationships totaling million make up of our non performing assets 
these high end subdivisions  while showing initial progress  have stalled due to the recession 
non accrual loans increased due to the addition of six credit relationships totaling million 
these credit relationships are secured by real estate and we have provided adequate allowance based on current information 
offsetting this increase was a credit relationship being removed from the non accrual category when the loan was re written with new guarantors and four non accrual relationships totaling million were transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
all non performing loans are considered impaired 
non performing assets for the period include million in restructured commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
one credit relationship comprises million of our restructured loans 
the terms of our restructured loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest or extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
the decrease in restructured loans from december  is due in part to the transfer of a credit relationship totaling million to non accrual status 
in addition  we removed two credit relationships totaling million from the restructured category since the terms of the loans are now substantially equivalent to terms on which loans with comparable risks are being made and the borrowers have performed according to the terms of the contract for the past to months 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale investment portfolio increased by million due to the purchase of a government sponsored mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities and state and municipal obligations 
offsetting this increase was the sale of equity securities 
the held to maturity investment portfolio decreased million as securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms due to decreasing rates 
we evaluate investment securities with significant declines in fair value on a quarterly basis to determine whether they should be considered other than temporarily impaired under current accounting guidance  which generally provides that if a security is in an unrealized loss position  whether due to general market conditions or industry or issuer specific factors  the holder of the securities must assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether management has the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on our u 
s 
treasury and agency securities and our government sponsored mortgage backed residential securities were a result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  
table of contents the unrealized losses on the state and municipal securities were caused primarily by interest rate decreases 
the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
because we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  we also considered the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and identified no matters that would indicate less than full recovery 
we have evaluated the decline in the fair value of our trust preferred securities  which are directly related to the credit and liquidity crisis that the financial services industry has experienced in recent years 
the trust preferred securities market is currently inactive making the valuation of trust preferred securities very difficult 
we value trust preferred securities using unobservable inputs through a discounted cash flow analysis as permitted under current accounting guidance and using the expected cash flows appropriately discounted using present value techniques 
refer to note fair value for more information 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million for the expected credit loss during the period and million during the time we have held these securities on five of our trust preferred securities with an original cost basis of million 
all of our trust preferred securities are currently rated below investment grade 
one of our trust preferred securities continues to pay interest as scheduled through december   and is expected to continue paying interest as scheduled 
the other four trust preferred securities are paying either partial or full interest in kind instead of full cash interest 
see note securities for more information 
management will continue to evaluate these securities for impairment quarterly

deposits we rely primarily on providing excellent customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network  we emphasize growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value 
total deposits increased million compared to december  due to several successful deposit promotions 
retail and commercial deposits increased million during public funds  brokered deposits and certificate of deposits account registry service cdars certificates decreased million 
brokered deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
however  the consent order issued in january  resulted in the bank being categorized as a troubled institution by bank regulators 
the troubled institution designation restricts the amount of interest the bank may pay on deposits 
unless the bank is granted a waiver because it resides in a market that the fdic determines is a high rate market  the bank is limited to paying deposit interest rates within 
of the average rates computed by the fdic 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 

table of contents we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions and regulatory restrictions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds

on october   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on both issues of junior subordinated notes  together having an outstanding principal amount of million  relating to outstanding trust preferred securities 
we have the right to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
during the deferral period  the respective statutory trusts  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of first financial service corporation  that were formed to issue the trust preferred securities  will likewise suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities 
the regular scheduled interest payments will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as an expense for financial statement purposes 
liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
our investment 
table of contents and funds management policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our banking centers provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  we maintain adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from two of our correspondent bank 
one line is for million and the other is for million 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we did not have sufficient collateral available for additional borrowings from the fhlb 
in addition  due to our agreement with bank regulatory agencies  we are not allowed to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits including deposits through the cdars program without prior regulatory approval and we are limited in the rates we may pay on deposits 
we believe that we have adequate funding sources through unused borrowing capacity from our correspondent banks  unpledged investment securities  loan principal repayment and potential asset maturities and sales to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kdfi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
the bank currently has a regulatory agreement with the fdic and kdfi that requires us to obtain the consent of the regional director of the fdic and the commissioner of the kdfi to declare and pay cash dividends 
the corporation has also entered into an agreement with the federal reserve to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends 
we may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of  to the corporation 
at december   cash held by the corporation is  capital stockholders equity decreased million during  primarily due to a net loss recorded during the period and an increase in unrealized loss on securities available for sale 
our average stockholders equity to average assets ratio decreased to at december  compared to at the end of on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury under the terms of its capital purchase program 
the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per year after five years 
under the terms of our cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles the us treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date the us treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years and is potentially dilutive to earnings per share 
on october   we gave written notice to the united states treasury that we were suspending the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a series a preferred stock

in addition to our agreement with the federal reserve that requires prior written consent to repurchase common shares  the terms of our senior preferred shares do not allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock without the consent of the holder until the senior preferred shares are redeemed

each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks 
banks must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets ranging from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
we intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the well capitalized requirements established for banks by the fdic 
as part of an informal regulatory agreement with the fdic  the bank was required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of 
at december   we were not in compliance with the tier capital requirement 
on january   the bank entered into a consent order  a formal agreement with the fdic and kdfi  under which  among other things  the bank has agreed to achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by march  and achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  the consent order supersedes the prior informal regulatory agreement 
to achieve the capital requirements that we have agreed to with the fdic and kdfi  we are working on various specific initiatives to increase our regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets such as sales of loans  raising common stock  or the sale of branch offices or the institution

impact of inflation changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this filing have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  comprised of senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated 
at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will increase 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease
