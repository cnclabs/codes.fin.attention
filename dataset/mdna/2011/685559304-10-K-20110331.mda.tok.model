executive overview for the year ended december   our sales slightly increased to  compared to  during the same period in despite the slight increase in sales  our net loss increased during to  from a net loss of  in the increase in net loss in the current year was mainly attributable to  of costs associated with the non renewal of our former chief executive officer contract and lower gross margins at our electronics group 
the lower gross margins at our electronics group were principally due to higher than expected labor and material costs on our mk contact that was completed by june  and inventory write downs and disposals 
despite the increase in net loss in compared to  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  in compared to  in in addition  after completing our impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets  we concluded impairment charges of  and  should be taken in connection with the goodwill and recorded intangible assets  respectively  arising from the ics acquisition in in  we recorded impairment charges of  and  for recorded intangible assets and goodwill  respectively  relating to the ics acquisition in all goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of ics have been written off at december  our backlog at december  was approximately  compared to  at december  there is no seasonality to our business 
our shipping schedules are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
both of our operating segments are pursuing a significant amount of business opportunities and we are confident that we will receive many of the orders we are pursuing  although timing is always an uncertainty 
despite our weak operating results  our balance sheet remains strong as evidenced by our to current ratio at december  in march  we entered into a new credit agreement with a new commercial lender pursuant to which we a established a line of credit up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these new facilities were used to pay off in full our obligations to our former primary lender pursuant to a prior credit facility and to provide us general working capital needs 
the new credit facilities are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our assets 
as a result of our first quarter loss due to shipping delays  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at march  in addition  as a result of our fourth quarter loss due mainly to costs associated with the non renewal of our former chief executive officer employment contract  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at december  however  we did negotiate amendments to our credit agreement in may and march and we were in compliance with our financial covenants at june  and september  in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program through december  allowing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through may  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share 
in may  in connection with an amendment to our credit agreement  we suspended our stock repurchase program 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
our financial statements have been prepared based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  goodwill impairment  valuation of share based compensation  revenue and cost recognition on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and other than temporary impairment on marketable securities 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current business conditions and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost specific  average and first in  first out basis or market 
inventory items are reviewed regularly for excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can be forecasted based on current backlog  customer options to reorder under existing contracts  the need to retrofit older units and parts needed for general repairs 
although we make every effort to insure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have an impact on the level of obsolete material in our inventory and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
however  world events have forced our country into various situations of conflict whereby equipment is used and parts may be needed for repair 
this could lead to increased product demand as well as the use of some older inventory items that we had previously determined obsolete 
deferred tax asset at december   we had an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  with no limitation on the carry forward period and federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively that expire through approximately   of federal net operating loss carry forwards expire between in addition  we receive a tax deduction when our employees exercise their non qualified stock options thereby increasing our deferred tax asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that a portion of the amount may not be realized 
we estimate our valuation allowance based on an estimated forecast of our future profitability 
any significant changes in future profitability resulting from variations in future revenues or expenses could affect the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
impairment of goodwill we have a significant amount of goodwill and had a significant amount of acquired intangible assets 
in determining the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  assumptions are made regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
after completing the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  we concluded an impairment charge should be taken at december  for the remaining carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of ics in an impairment charge was also taken at december  in connection with the recorded goodwill and intangible assets arising from our ics acquisition 
as of december   all acquired intangible assets have either been fully amortized or written off 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
the balance of our goodwill for each of our operating units as of december  is as follows tdl  and behlman  after the impairment charge taken on the remaining carrying value of ics goodwill and intangible assets at december   of the two reporting units with goodwill  tdl and behlman have a fair value that is in excess of their carrying value by approximately and  respectively 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our actual results and or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation awards by recording compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and expensing such compensation over the vesting periods of the awards  which is generally one to ten years 
total share based compensation expense was  for the year ended december  during   shares of restricted stock and no stock options were granted 
the estimated fair value of stock options granted in were calculated using the black scholes model 
this model requires the use of input assumptions 
these assumptions include expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
revenue and cost recognition revenue and costs under larger  long term contracts are reported on the percentage of completion method 
for projects where materials have been purchased  but have not been placed in production  the costs of such materials are excluded from costs incurred for the purpose of measuring the extent of progress toward completion 
the amount of earnings recognized at the financial statement date is based on an efforts expended method  which measures the degree of completion on a contract based on the amount of labor dollars incurred compared to the total labor dollars expected to complete the contract 
when an ultimate loss is indicated on a contract  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period 
assets related to these contracts are included in current assets as they will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion  although this may require more than one year 
marketable securities we currently have approximately  invested primarily in corporate bonds 
we treat our investments as available for sale which requires us to assess our portfolio each reporting period to determine whether declines in fair value below book value are considered to be other than temporary 
we must first determine that we have both the intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in its fair value to its amortized cost 
in assessing whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered  we compare the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected from the security determination of fair value with the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value and the write down is included in earnings as a realized loss  and a new cost is established for the security 
any further impairment of the security related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
any subsequent recovery in fair value is not recognized until the security either is sold or matures 
we use several factors in our determination of the cash flows expected to be collected including i the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii whether a decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry  iv whether interest payments continue to be made and v any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
although we received all our interest payments during the current year  we recorded an other than temporary impairment write down of  for the three months ended march  consisting of bonds held in two separate issuers in which we determined the decline in fair value was due to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry 
we did not take any additional other than temporary impairment charges for the remainder of or results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  we currently operate in two industry segments  our electronics group and our power group 
the electronics group includes our orbit instrument division and our tdl subsidiary which are engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic components and subsystems and our ics subsidiary which performs system integration for gun weapons systems and fire control interface as well as logistics support and documentation 
the power group includes our behlman subsidiary which is engaged in the design and manufacture of commercial power units and cots power solutions 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased slightly by to  from  for the year ended december  due to a slight increase in sales from our electronics group which was partially offset by a slight decrease in sales from our power group 
sales from our electronics group increased which was primarily due to an increase in sales from our orbit instrument division and tdl subsidiary which was partially offset by a decrease in sales from ics 
the increase in sales from our orbit instrument division of was primarily attributable to an increase in bookings in compared to sales from our power group slightly decreased by for the current year due to decreased sales from its cots division and despite increased sales from its commercial division 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year 
this decrease resulted mainly from a lower gross profit from our electronics group v 

the decrease in the electronics group was due to a lower gross profit at ics due to higher than expected labor and material costs associated with the mk contract which was completed by june  the decrease in the electronics group was also due to inventory disposals and write downs taken by our orbit instrument division and tdl subsidiary despite an increase in sales at both divisions 
the decrease in gross profit v 
from our power group was principally due to product mix and a slight decrease in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from both our electronics group and power group and lower corporate costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  principally due to a decrease in expenses and a slight increase in sales 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided not to renew the contract of one of our former senior officers effectively terminating his employment as of december  as a result  we recorded an expense of  for estimated costs associated with the contract non renewal 
included in the recorded expense is  of stock compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to such officer 
during september  ics received an award for fewer mk s than ordered during the prior year 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we learned that the award for potential new business on the us navy new littoral combat ship will be less than expected 
consequently  we determined that future cash flows for ics are projected to decrease 
as a result  we determined the undiscounted future cash flows for certain of our intangible assets were less than their carrying value 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge for the full remaining carrying value  of ics intangible assets in the year ended december  in the prior year  after completing our impairment testing  we concluded an impairment charge of  should be taken relating to certain of our intangible assets 
also during the fourth quarter  after completing the annual impairment testing of goodwill pursuant to asc  we concluded an impairment charge of  representing the remaining carrying value of goodwill arising from the acquisition of ics in  should be taken 
in the prior year  after completing our impairment testing  we concluded an impairment charge of  should be taken in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from the ics acquisition 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to an increase in the interest rate paid on balances outstanding on our term loan and credit facility and despite a decrease in the amounts owed to lenders in the current period due to the pay down of our debt 
investment and other income for the year ended december  increased to  from  from the prior year principally due to recorded gains of  on corporate bonds sold  one of which an other than temporary impairment charge was taken in the prior period and despite a decrease in the amounts invested during the period 
loss before income tax provision was  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in loss during the current year was principally due to  of costs related to the non renewal of the contract of our former chief executive officer and lower gross profit and despite a slight increase in sales  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 
income taxes for the year ended december  was  consisting of state income and federal minimum taxes that cannot be offset by any state or federal net operating loss carry forwards that was offset by the reversal of certain state income taxes previously accrued 
income taxes for the year ended december  was  consisting of state and federal minimum taxes that cannot be offset by any state or federal net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the year ended december  decreased to a loss of  compared to  for the year ended december  listed below is the ebitda reconciliation to net loss year ended december  net loss   interest expense   income tax expense   goodwill and intangible asset impairment   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be construed as an alternative to net income 
an element of our growth strategy has been through strategic acquisitions which have been substantially funded through the issuance of debt 
this has resulted in significant interest expense and amortization expense 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it is useful to our investors and management as a measure of cash generated by our business operations that will be used to service our debt and fund future acquisitions as well as provide an additional element of operating performance 
liquidity  capital resources and inflation working capital decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  compared to to at december  the reduction in working capital was principally due to the repayment of debt and to the liability associated with our former chief executive officer 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the liability associated with our former chief executive officer  the non cash intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  the decrease in cost and earnings in excess of billings and other assets that was partially offset by the net loss for the year  the gain on the sale of marketable securities  and the increase in current assets 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the non cash intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation and the decrease in accounts receivable that was partially offset by the net loss for the year  an increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the sale of marketable securities that was offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the purchase of fixed assets  incurred by tdl in connection with its new operating facility that was partially offset by the sale of marketable securities and fixed assets 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the repayments of long term debt and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset by loan proceeds from our line of credit and stock option exercises 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  was primarily attributable to the repayments of long term debt and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset from loan proceeds from our line of credit and stock option exercises 
in april  we entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of tdl and its manufacturing affiliate tdl term loan 
in december  we entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of ics ics term loan 
principal payments under the two term loan facilities were approximately  per month 
in december  we also amended an existing  line of credit facility with a commercial lender secured by accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
the line of credit facility was to continue from year to year unless sooner terminated for an event of default including non compliance with certain financial covenants 
in april  we entered into a five year  promissory note with the selling shareholders of tdl tdl shareholder note at an interest rate of prime plus 
principal payments of  were made on a quarterly basis along with accrued interest 
in june  we refinanced the  balance due on the tdl shareholder note with our primary commercial lender 
under the terms of the new term loan entered into with our primary commercial lender tdl refinanced shareholder loan  monthly payments of  were made over a thirty month period through january along with accrued interest pursuant to the interest terms described below 
the tdl refinanced shareholder loan was paid off in january as a result of decreased revenue and profitability due to the customer contract delay for the mk that is recorded under the percentage of completion method  we were not in compliance with two of our financial covenant ratios as of june  in august  our primary lender agreed to waive these covenant defaults 
the lender  in consideration of such waiver  assessed a waiver fee of  and increased the interest rate on all term debt  including the tdl term loan  tdl refinanced shareholder loan and ics term loan  and the line of credit equal to the sum of plus the one month libor 
in addition  we agreed to reduce our line of credit from  to  until october   at which time it was further reduced to  as a result of the customer contract delay for the mk and capital expenditures made for our new tdl operating facility  we were not in compliance with two of our financial covenant ratios at september  in november  our primary lender agreed to waive the covenant defaults as of september  and to amend the requirement for two of the financial ratios at december  and for one of the financial ratios at march  our lender  in consideration of such waiver  assessed a waiver fee of  and increased the interest rate on all term debt  including the tdl term loan  tdl refinanced shareholder loan and ics term loan  and the line of credit to the sum of plus the one month libor 
in addition  we agreed to reduce our line of credit from  to  at december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  on march   we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with a new commercial lender pursuant to which we a established a new line of credit of up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these new credit facilities were used to pay off all of our obligations to our former primary lender and to provide for our general working capital needs 
the new credit facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the term loan is payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest and matures on march  the expiration date on the line of credit was extended to august  payment of interest on all loans is due at a rate per annum at our option as follows for a prime rate loan under the line of credit at a rate equal to the prime rate established by the bank plus  for a prime rate loan under the term loan at a rate equal to the prime rate established by the bank plus  for a libor loan under the line of credit at a rate equal to libor plus and for a libor loan under the term loan at a rate equal to libor plus 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain financial covenants 
available borrowings under the line of credit are subject to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and  for the term loan facility only  cash and marketable securities 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default such as non payment  bankruptcy and material adverse change 
as a result of our first quarter loss  primarily due to shipping schedule delays  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at march  in may  our lender agreed to i waive the covenant default  and ii to amend the financial covenant ratio in question for the remainder of and replace it with a new covenant related to the company operating profitability 
the lender  in consideration of such waiver and amendment  assessed a waiver fee of  plus legal fees and increased the interest rate on our line of credit and term debt to the prime rate of interest plus and the prime rate of interest plus  respectively 
in addition  we agreed to enhanced reporting and monitoring requirements  to suspend our stock repurchase program  and all future borrowings to be on a prime rate basis only and not on a libor basis 
as a result of our fourth quarter loss  primarily due to the costs associated with the non renewal of our former chief executive officer employment contract  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at december  in march  we and our lender agreed to i waive the covenant default  ii replace a financial covenant ratio for the first two quarters of with a new covenant related to the our operating profitability  iii modify the definition of a financial covenant  iv institute a new covenant related to the company liquidity  and v extend the expiration date of our line of credit to august  the lender  in consideration of such waiver and amendment  assessed a waiver fee of  plus legal fees but did not change the interest rate on our line of credit or term debt 
our existing capital resources  including our bank credit facilities and our cash flow from operations  is expected to be adequate to cover our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program through december  allowing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through may  we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  in may  in connection with the amendment to our credit agreement  we suspended our stock repurchase program 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of our company 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
certain material trends during the first quarter of  our revenue and profitability was adversely affected by approximately million in production orders contained in the backlog of our orbit instrument division and tdl subsidiary  some of which was scheduled for delivery in the first quarter  that were delayed due to technical issues at the prime contractor level that was unrelated to our hardware 
shipments on the orders for our orbit instrument division  approximating  commenced in the fourth quarter and have continued into the first quarter of shipment for the  in orders for our tdl subsidiary was initially postponed until  however  in november  tdl received notification that its prime contractor was terminated by the us government 
tdl does not have any significant termination claim on this contract 
during the third quarter of and during the fourth quarter  our orbit instrument division received several new follow on contract awards for its legacy hardware 
based on these awards  our orbit instrument division  in  recorded bookings of over  its highest level in many years 
in addition  the division was recently notified by its prime contractor on a program that it provides one of its products related to federal aviation administration air traffic control towers that it is seeking to procure a significant amount of units which could approximate  delivery schedules for these units have not yet been determined although it is currently expected that the concentration of deliveries will be in nevertheless  we expect initial orders under this contract to be received during due to its increasing backlog and this latest opportunity  our orbit instrument division appears well positioned for increased revenue and profitability in ics experienced a delay in the award for its mk gun console system which affected its first and second quarter shipments in this award was finally received by ics at the end of september ics had commenced the procurement process of material and labor resources were allocated to the job beginning in the second quarter 
as a result  certain cabinets were delivered by the end of but due to the delay in the receipt of the award  other cabinets were not delivered until the second quarter of and due to inefficient production resulting from the delay  profitability was adversely affected 
we experienced a similar delay in the award of the mk gun console system to ics for shipment delays related to contracting  funding and engineering issues are commonplace in our industry and could  in the future  have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
the commercial division of our power group has historically been vulnerable to a weak economy 
bookings in the commercial division were weak during most of due to the severe recession resulting from the financial crisis 
however  bookings from the cots division remained fairly strong 
however  as economic conditions started to improve into  bookings from our commercial division started to improve along with continued strength from our cots division 
as a result  our power group had another strong year of revenue and profitability for and improved economic conditions has our power group well positioned for increased revenue and profitability for in april  we completed the acquisition of tdl and its operations became part of our electronics group 
in december  we completed the acquisition of ics which also became part of our electronics group 
our electronics group and the cots division of our power group are heavily dependent on military spending 
although we are heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income  increased military spending does not necessarily guarantee us increased revenues  particularly  when the allocation of budget dollars may vary depending on what may be needed for specific military conflicts 
due to budget constraints  government spending is coming under intense pressure and the defense budget  usually immune from such pressures  is also under review 
reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government due to budget constraints or for any other reason  could have a negative impact on our future revenues and earnings 
however  we believe that any future cuts in defense spending will be in certain areas of the defense budget that will not affect us 
in fact  we believe that defense budget dollars that are allocated to modernization and refurbishment of military equipment will remain the same or increase which will generally benefit us 
although our electronics group and our cots division of our power group are pursuing several opportunities for reorders  as well as new contract awards  we have normally found it difficult to predict the timing of such awards 
in addition  we have an unprecedented amount of new opportunities that are in the prototype or pre production stage 
these opportunities generally move to a production stage at a later date but the timing of such is also uncertain 
however  once initial production is received  we believe we are generally well positioned to receive follow on orders depending on government needs and funding requirements 
there is no seasonality to our business 
our revenues are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
we stratify all the opportunities we are pursuing by various confidence levels 
we generally realize a very high success rate with those opportunities to which we apply a high confidence level 
we currently have a significant amount of potential contract awards to which we have applied a high confidence level 
however  because it is difficult to predict the timing of awards for most of the opportunities we are pursuing  it is also difficult to predict when we will commence shipping under these contracts 
a delay in the receipt of any contract from our customer ultimately causes a corresponding delay in shipments under that contract 
despite the expected increase in military refurbishment and modernization  we still face a challenging environment 
the government is emphasizing the engineering of new and improved weaponry and it continues to be our challenge to work with each of our prime contractors so that we can participate on these new programs 
in addition  these new contracts require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and pre production costs 
while we attempt to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by our customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun that may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once we have completed the design and pre production stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
in such event  even if we are reimbursed for our development costs  it will not generate any significant profits 
in may  we hired an investment banker to pursue strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
those investment banker activities were primarily focused on a potential sale of the company 
in january  we terminated the services with such investment banker and we are no longer actively pursuing a sale of the company 
in march  we hired a new investment banker to help us expand our operations and achieve better utilization of our existing facilities through strategic  accretive acquisitions 
through the past several years  we reviewed various potential acquisitions and believe there are numerous opportunities presently available  particularly to integrate into our current operating facilities 
however  there is no assurance that any future acquisition will be accomplished 
in addition  due to current economic conditions and tightening of credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary financing to complete additional acquisitions and even if we do  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient income from operations of such acquired companies to satisfy the interest payments  in which case  we will be required to pay them out of our existing operations which may be adversely affected
