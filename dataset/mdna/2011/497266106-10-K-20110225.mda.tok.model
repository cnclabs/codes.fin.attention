table of contents overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges  including leased barges  and million barrels of capacity as of december  the company operated an average of towing vessels during  of which an average of was chartered 
the company uses the united states inland waterway system to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
the company also owns and operates four ocean going barge and tug units transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastwise trade 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
for  net earnings attributable to kirby were  or per share  on revenues of  compared with net earnings attributable to kirby of  or per share  on revenues of  the performance reflected an improvement in tank barge demand and equipment utilization levels in the company s petrochemical and black oil markets  primarily due to the continued modest improvement in production volumes from united states petrochemical plants throughout  and the exportation of diesel fuel and black oil products produced at united states refineries 
in addition  diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  thereby positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation clauses in the company s term contracts 
offsetting the improved demand and higher equipment utilization was the negative impact of lower term contract and spot contract rates negotiated throughout and the first half of due to recessionary pressure and resulting lower industry wide demand 
the diesel engine services segment s service levels and direct parts sales were relatively consistent with levels due to the continued weak gulf coast oil services market that historically has generated to of the segment s revenues 
as a result of the lower demand in both the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments during late  and the first quarter of  the company took specific steps to reduce overhead and lower expenditures 
during the first and fourth quarters  charges totaling  or 
per share  were taken for early retirement incentives and staff reductions in both the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
during the first quarter  the company continued its cost reduction initiatives by further reducing its marine transportation and corporate overhead costs through early retirements and staff reductions  incurring a charge of  before taxes  or 
per share 
since its peak headcount in october  the company has reduced its shore staff by through early retirements  staff reductions and employee attrition 
marine transportation for  of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the united states 
products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the united states economy and the volumes produced by the company s customer base

in addition  diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  thereby positively impacting marine transportation revenues as fuel is escalated and de escalated through revenue adjustment clauses in customers term contracts 
offsetting the improved demand and higher equipment utilization was the negative impact of lower term contract and spot contract rates negotiated throughout and the first half of due to recessionary pressure and resulting lower industry wide demand 
during  approximately of the marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues compared with under term contracts and under spot contracts during the percentage applicable to term contracts declined beginning in the fourth quarter of as certain customers switched to spot contracts  and in some cases  short term charters when their term contracts expired 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented approximately of marine transportation revenues under term contracts during compared with for rates on term contracts  net of fuel  renewed during the first quarter generally decreased an average of approximately when compared with term contracts renewed in the first quarter of rates on term contracts renewed in the second quarter were relatively flat with the first quarter renewals  but declined an average of to when compared with the second quarter

spot contract rates for the second quarter were up an average of to compared with the first quarter  but when compared with the second quarter were down an average of to 
spot market rates for the third and fourth quarters were relatively flat to slightly positive compared with the second quarter 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts were neutral 

table of contents the marine transportation operating margin for was compared with for the lower operating margin reflected the impact of lower term contract and spot contract pricing negotiated throughout the year and the first half  higher fuel costs and increased delay days 
this was partially offset by higher tank barge utilization in the petrochemical market during the second  third and fourth quarters  and in the black oil market in the third and fourth quarters  by cost reduction initiatives implemented during and  and decreased charges for early retirements and staff reductions 
diesel engine services during  of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated through service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the marine  power generation and railroad industries it serves 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market markets serviced revenue distribution customers marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial diesel engine services revenue and operating income for decreased and  respectively  compared with demand levels for service and direct parts sales across the majority of the marine markets  particularly the gulf coast oil services market  remained weak during  resulting from customers continued deferral of major maintenance projects 
in addition  the moratorium on gulf of mexico deep water drilling  uncertainty around new drilling regulations and corresponding delays in issuing drilling permits negatively impacted both the gulf coast medium speed and high speed operations during the second quarter and second half 
partially offsetting the weaknesses in the marine market was required repair work for customers involved in the gulf coast oil spill cleanup 
the year did benefit from additional engine generator set upgrades and higher parts and engine sales in the medium speed power generation market 
the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for was compared with for the operating margin reflected overall lower service levels and direct parts sales  excluding the power generation market as noted above  some pricing pressure in the high speed marine markets and lower labor utilization  partially offset by the positive impact of the and cost reduction initiatives 
the charges for early retirements and staff reductions of  also lowered the operating margin 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during with net cash provided by operating activities of  compared with net cash provided by operating activities for of  the year experienced a net decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of  primarily due to increased receivables from stronger business activity levels and a federal income tax receivable as of december  of  the result of the recently enacted small business jobs act of small business act that included a one year extension of bonus tax depreciation on qualified property 
this extension was made after the company made three quarterly estimated tax payments based on the assumption that bonus tax depreciation would not be extended and  as a result  the company overpaid its estimated federal income taxes 
in addition  the tax relief  
table of contents unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of tax relief act that was signed on december  provides bonus tax depreciation for capital investments placed in service after september  through december  for equipment placed in service after december  and through december   the bill provides for bonus tax depreciation 
the net decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities in compares with a net increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities in the year of  primarily due to a decrease in receivables during  the result of decreased revenues due to weaker business activity levels 
in addition during  the company generated cash of  from the exercise of stock options and  from proceeds from the disposition of assets 
during  cash generated was used for capital expenditures of  including  for new tank barge and towboat construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet  and  for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december  from at december  debt was essentially unchanged but equity increased primarily due to net earnings attributable to kirby for of  exercise of stock options and the amortization of unearned equity compensation  partially offset by treasury stock purchases 
as of december   the company had no outstanding balance under its  revolving credit facility and had  of cash and cash equivalents 
during  taking advantage of current attractive tank barge construction prices  the company took delivery of new tank barges and six chartered tank barges with a total capacity of  barrels  and three horsepower towboats 
the company projects that capital expenditures for  assuming the closing of the united holdings llc united purchase described below  will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
for  new construction commitments include tank barges with a total capacity of  barrels and three horsepower towboats 
outlook the company s strong cash flow and unutilized loan facilities position the company to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
the marine transportation segment s external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent tank barge operators and captive fleet owners seeking to outsource tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size through external growth opportunities would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  positioning barges closer to cargoes  less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power and minimal incremental administrative staff 
the diesel engine services segment s external growth opportunities include further consolidation of strategically located diesel service providers  and expanded service capability for other engine related products 
petrochemical and black oil tank barge utilization levels on the gulf intracoastal waterway and into the midwest improved during when compared with  a year of economic recession 
the current excess industry tank barge capacity has also improved slightly in during the company estimates that tank barges were constructed and delivered  of which were the company s 
during  the company estimates that tank barges were retired  of which were the company s 
at the beginning of  the company estimates there were  tank barges in the industry fleet  of which approximately were over years old and approximately of those over years old 
at the end of  the company estimated there were approximately  tank barges in the industry fleet 
given the age profile of the industry fleet and current industry wide excess tank barge capacity  the company expects older barges will continue to be removed from service and industry supply and demand will continue to slowly move closer to balance 
while improvement in utilization levels and the slight reduction in industry capacity is encouraging  the continued sluggish united states economy  consistently high unemployment levels  negative consumer confidence  current excess industry tank barge capacity  and the continued negative impact of pending safety regulations enacted on gulf of mexico drillers and its unknown impact on the diesel engine services segment leave the company s outlook for unclear 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  the current united states and global recession could impact the collectability of certain customers trade receivables which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 

table of contents accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating inland tank barges and towing vessels  transporting petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals along the united states inland waterways 
as of december   the company operated active inland tank barges  with a total capacity of million barrels  compared with active inland tank barges at december   with a total capacity of million barrels 
the company operated an average of inland towing vessels during and during the company owns and operates four offshore dry bulk barge and tug units engaged in the offshore transportation of dry bulk cargoes 
the company also owns a two thirds interest in osprey  which transports cargo containers and project cargoes by barge on the united states inland waterway system

table of contents compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting an improvement in tank barge demand and equipment utilization levels in the company s petrochemical and black oil markets  primarily due to the continued modest improvement in production volumes from united states petrochemical plants throughout  and the exportation of diesel fuel and black oil products produced at united states refineries 
in addition  diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  thereby positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in the company s term contracts 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenue for throughout  petrochemical transportation demand reflected a continued improvement in business levels 
lower priced domestic natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provided the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production improved as the year progressed  thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations 
as a result of the higher volumes  the company s petrochemical tank barge fleet s utilization level was in the high range during the majority of the first quarter s improvement in the utilization level was also attributable to supply chain disruptions caused by petrochemical turnarounds and unscheduled plant maintenance 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  saw lower utilization of the fleet  as well as a heavy shipyard maintenance cycle for black oil barges during the first half 
during the second half  a heavy united states refinery maintenance schedule which required additional black oil shipments between refineries  coupled with the exportation of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil  resulted in the company s black oil fleet maintaining a high range utilization level 
the refined petroleum products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  reflected continued lower demand for movements of products  consistent with prevailing conditions in the united states economy  partially offset by an improvement of river ethanol volumes 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was weak during the first quarter due to high midwest inventory levels  fueled by heavy rain and snow which reduced the farmer s ability to apply fertilizer  improved in the second quarter with the midwest spring fill  declined significantly in the third quarter with a worldwide shortage of fertilizer and improved in the fourth quarter with a delayed fall fill

the higher delay days led to increased operating expenses compared with the delay days reflected more normal weather and lock conditions  including ice and high water conditions during portions of the first and second quarters and numerous delays from scheduled lock repairs during the third quarter 
this compares with first nine months that experienced milder winter weather conditions and favorable water levels 
delay days for the fourth quarter were below the fourth quarter  primarily due to favorable weather during the month of december 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues  compared with under term contracts and under spot contracts during the first nine months 
the percentage applicable to term contracts declined beginning in the fourth quarter of as certain customers switched to spot contracts  and in some cases  short term charters when their term contracts expired
