item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally engaged in the production of copper replacement products which include refined copper products  copper wire produced from refined scrap copper and cca wire 
we manufacture and sell four major types of refined copper products and copper alternative products copper anode  pure copper rod  pure copper wire and cca wire 
copper anode  pure copper rod and pure copper wire products are produced from refined scrap copper utilizing our proprietary scrap copper recycling and cleaning technology and process 
in the first quarter of  with the completion of a  ton per annum capacity smelter  we introduced a new production process and product line which enables us to produce pure copper products from scrap copper 
the new production process involves the fire refining of bulk recycled copper into high purity  low oxygen content copper rods also known as fire refined high conductivity rods 
we then either sell these large diameter mm copper rods into a range of markets  or further process these rods into much smaller diameter eg  mm copper wire also known as superfine copper wire 
we believe this recycled superfine copper wire is generally a more cost effective product for our customers  compared with pure copper wire manufactured from newly mined copper 
we launched production of copper anode in july  in conjunction with the completion of our second copper smelter  with an annual capacity of  tons 
the completion of this second smelter doubles our recycled copper refining and manufacturing capacity to  tons per year 
copper anode is the fundamental building block for almost all pure copper products  and holds a wide range of potential end market uses 
we believe that our pricing advantage on our refined copper products can be maintained regardless of fluctuations in the commodity price of copper 
we believe we were among the first manufacturers to commercialize cca superfine wire production in china 
currently we have three different cca products cca fine wire  cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
cca fine wire is the raw material for cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
in the case of cca magnet wire  we coat the cca fine wire with a special magnetic coating  while in the case of cca tin plated wire  we plate the cca fine wire with a very thin layer of tin 
the value added nature of our cca superfine wire products lies in our ability and technology to draw down from much larger diameter cca raw wire  and further process it to produce super fine cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
as a result  cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire command higher market prices and higher gross margins than plain cca fine wire 
we draw pure copper wire from the refined pure copper rod we produce 
the pure copper wire we produce has three main sub categories of products fine wire  magnet wire and tin plated wire 
these three copper wire products have the similar characteristics as the three cca wire products mentioned above 
we have expanded our business from the cca superfine wire segment into the scrap copper refinery business because we believe that the scrap copper refinery business allows us to sell into the much bigger pure copper products market and offers us the ability to grow more rapidly while utilizing the proprietary equipment and technology that we possess relating to both the scrap copper cleaning as well as superfine wire drawing 
we believe that the ability to sell into the large and growing copper and copper replacement products market in china offers us substantial opportunity to increase our sales in the future 
we anticipate that we will continue to expand production capacity in both refined copper products and cca wire  but that the majority of our investment and resulting planned growth in sales volume will occur in the refined copper products business  which caters to a much bigger pure copper products market  compared with the cca wire market 
we sell our products primarily in china  either through distributors or directly to users  including distributors in the wire and cable industries and copper conglomerates as well as manufacturers in the consumer electronics  white goods  automotive  utility  telecommunications and specialty cable industries 
our market for copper anode is very large and diverse as copper anode is the raw material for copper cathode  which in turn is the foundation for most pure copper products 
for our other three main product categories copper rod  copper wire and cca wire  our markets overlap to a degree  and are characterized by their breadth and depth  with a very large number of current and potential customers for each product category 
copper rod is a raw material used in wire and cable production 
our refined copper products copper anode  copper rod and copper wire  which are manufactured from recycled scrap copper  compete directly with copper products made from virgin eg newly mined copper 
to date  our raw material costs for bulk scrap copper have been lower than prices for virgin copper  which provides us with a pricing advantage in the market for the refined copper products we produce from scrap copper 
during  we sold copper anode to a few copper conglomerates which use our product to produce copper cathode 
we sold copper rod to approximately customers  most of which are producers of smaller diameter copper wire used in power cables ranging in size from high voltage power transmission cables to white good applications such as internal wiring in household appliances and consumer electronics 
our copper wire  which is sold in a variety of diameters and may have undergone further in line processing such as coating with plastic  is sold to many of the same types of end use customers who purchase copper wire from our copper rod customers 
these include manufacturers of a wide range of power cables and products that incorporate wiring  such as household appliances  automobiles  consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment 
our cca wire is sold to many of these manufacturers also 
cca wire sells at a lower cost per unit of weight than pure copper wire  due to the relatively lower density of the aluminum core which makes up most of the volume of cca wire 
our cca wire offers conductivity performance characteristics that are only marginally below those of pure copper wire  which means they are attractive in a wide variety of product applications where a slight reduction in conductivity standards is tolerable such as most of the household appliance  automotive  consumer electronics and telecommunications applications 
examples of relatively high tolerance product applications where our cca wire would not provide an acceptable replacement option for pure copper wire would be military space equipment and wiring in nuclear power plants 
one low tolerance product category that requires pure copper wire rather than our less costly cca wire is electric motors  which require pure copper wire windings 
the markets for each of our product lines are growing rapidly  due both to growing demand in china for copper products including all types of basic wire raw materials and the relative cost advantages our product lines carry over virgin pure copper competitor products 
we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capture further market share in the copper and replacement product industry 
our refined copper products produced from recycled copper and cca wire are increasingly being accepted as cheaper alternatives to pure copper products 
as a result  our sales and net income have increased substantially during the last three years 
we generated sales of million  million and million for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
we achieved net income of million  million and million for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
in  we had a non cash charge of million  which resulted from the change in the fair value of the warrants issued to investors in conjunction with the company s issuance of convertible preferred stock in october excluding the impact of this non cash charge  net income for was million  up from the same period last year 
in  we had a million non cash gain on extinguishment of warrant liabilities and a non cash charge of million  which resulted from the change in the fair value of the warrants  excluding the impact of these non cash charges  net income for was million  up from the same period last year 
our capacity to sell our copper anode  copper rod  recycled copper wire products drawn from copper rod and cca wire products drawn from larger diameter cca wire is limited by the number and capacity of the equipment we have installed to produce these products 
our copper anode and copper rod are made from bulk scrap copper  which is cleaned  purified and smelted in large capacity smelter units 
at the present time we have two smelting facilities allocated to copper rod and copper anode production 
each smelting facility is capable of producing  tons per year 
in  we sold  tons of copper anode and  tons of copper rod 
as of december   we operated approximately high speed wire drawing machines  which draw larger diameter copper rod or cca rod into much finer diameter wires  with a total capacity of approximately  tons per annum of cca wire and approximately  tons per annum of copper wire 
certain of these drawing machines incorporate additional production steps such as coating  annealing or magnetizing the fine wire produced 
these drawing machines are manufactured to our design and specifications by custom equipment manufacturers located in china 
we are not dependent on any single custom equipment manufacturer for the fabrication of our drawing lines 
we have added six high capacity copper wire drawing production lines in first half  all of which are used to draw copper wire from our copper rod  and increased our annual capacity to  tons of copper wire  close to the  tons annual output of the smelter for copper rod production 
in the third quarter of this year  we have added a new smelter with  tons of annual capacity and started copper anode production 
on the planned new plant construction site  we are planning to add two new smelters with  tons of annual capacities each  which are anticipated to be completed in the second half of year accordingly  we do not anticipate that our sales will be capacity constrained in the near future  even if we continue to experience rapid sales growth 
significant factors affecting our results of operations the most significant factors that affect our financial condition and results of operations are economic conditions in china  the market price for copper  production capacity  supply and costs of principal raw materials  and product mix and implications on gross margins 
economic conditions in the prc we operate our manufacturing facilities in the prc and derive the majority of our revenues from sales to customers in the prc 
as such  economic conditions in the prc will affect virtually all aspects of our operations  including the demand for our products  the availability and prices of our raw materials and our other expenses 
the prc has experienced significant economic growth  achieving a cagr of in gross domestic product from through  according to national bureau of statistics of china 
domestic demand for and consumption of copper and cca products have increased substantially as a result of this growth 
we believe that economic conditions in the prc will continue to affect our business and results of operations 
copper prices generally the price of our products is set at a certain discount to local retail copper prices  and we believe our products replace or supplement copper 
for these reasons  our products are affected by the market price  demand and supply of copper 
we price our refined copper and cca wire products based on the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
as copper prices rise  our fixed dollar mark up per ton processed represents a relatively lower percentage of our gross sales which is generally based on tons processed and therefore our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is relatively lower  as copper prices decline  the inverse is true and we report relatively higher gross profit margins on a percentage basis 
despite the implications of copper price volatility on our gross and net profit margins in percentage terms  during the past three years the markup  or our gross and net profit in absolute dollar terms  has not been materially affected by the change of copper prices 
shanghai changjiang commodity market  one of the major metal trading markets in the prc  publishes the copper trading prices twice daily 
these prices typically set the range for the prices of our materials as well as finished products  and are generally followed by all industry participants 
production capacity in order to capture the market opportunity for our products  we have expanded  and plan to continue to expand  our production capacity 
increased capacity has had  and could continue to have  a significant effect on our results of operations  by allowing us to produce and sell more products to generate higher revenues and net income 
supply and costs of principal raw materials our ability to manage our operating costs depends significantly on our ability to secure affordable and reliable supplies of raw materials 
we have been able to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  which consist primarily of scrap copper and cca raw material wire 
the price of our primary raw materials varies with reference to copper prices  and changes in copper price affect our cost of sales 
however  we are able to price our copper and cca products based on our material procurement costs plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
therefore  despite the implications of copper price movement on our gross and net profit margin figures  during the past three years the mark up  or our gross and net profit in absolute dollars  have not been materially affected by the change in copper prices 
product mix and effect on gross margins our gross margin is also affected by our product mix 
we produce and sell products according to customer orders 
in our wire products pure copper wire and cca wire  magnet wire and tin plated wire are final products from which we will derive the highest production markup  or gross profit 
we also generate a significant portion of revenue from selling semi finished products such as fine wire at a lower production cost markup  or gross profit 
generally  copper anode and copper rod products contributes a lower gross profit margin compared to the wire products 
however  given the quick turnover and large volume production of the refined copper products  as well as primarily cash on delivery payment terms with our customers  the return on invested capital for the refined copper products and working capital turnover are much better than that of the wire products 
principal income statement components sales our sales are derived from sales of our products net of value added taxes 
the most significant factors that affect our sales are shipment volume and average selling prices 
our collection practices generally consist of cash payment on delivery 
however  we also extend credit for days to days to certain of our established customers in the cca wire category 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of direct material costs  and  to a lesser extent  direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead costs 
direct material costs generally accounted for the majority of our cost of sales 
gross profit our gross profit is affected primarily by the cost of raw materials  which is defined with reference to the cost of copper 
we are also able to price our products based on the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling expenses include shipping expenses  salaries and traveling expenses for our sales personnel 
our general and administrative expenses include administrative staff costs and other benefits  depreciation of office equipment  professional service fees and other miscellaneous expenses related to our administrative corporate activities 
our sales activities are conducted through direct selling by our internal sales staff 
because of the strong demand for our products  we have not had to start to aggressively market and distribute our products  and our selling expenses have been relatively small as a percentage of our revenues 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase with the anticipated growth of our business and continued upgrades to our information technology infrastructure 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as a result of compliance  investor relations and other expenses associated with being a publicly listed company 
other income and expense other income and expense includes interest income  interest expense  merger costs  foreign currency translation adjustments  and other income 
our interest expense consists of expenses related to our short term bank borrowings 
we expense all interest as it is incurred 
change in fair value of warrants the fair value of the company s issued and outstanding series a warrants and series b warrants  and the warrants issued to placement agents in conjunction with the company s initial public offering in september  was  as of december  and the company recognized a  loss  which is a non cash charge from the change in fair value of these warrants for the year ended december  income taxes under the current laws of the cayman islands and british virgin islands  we are not subject to any income or capital gains tax  and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding tax in the cayman islands or british virgin islands 
under the current laws of hong kong  we are not subject to any income or capital gains tax and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding tax in hong kong 
the new tax law also imposes a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside the prc for distribution of earnings generated after january  under the new tax law  the distribution of earnings generated prior to january  is exempt from the withholding tax 
as our subsidiaries in the prc will not be distributing their earnings to the company for the years ended december  and to the company  no deferred tax liability has been recognized for the undistributed earnings of these prc subsidiaries through december  total undistributed earnings of these prc subsidiaries at december  was rmb 
our two operating subsidiaries are governed by the prc income tax laws and are subject to the prc enterprise income tax eit 
each of the two entities files its own separate tax return 
according to the relevant laws and regulations in the prc  foreign invested enterprises established prior to january  were entitled to full exemption from income tax for two years beginning from the first year when enterprises become profitable and have accumulative profits and a income tax reduction for the subsequent three years 
being converted into a sino foreign joint equity enterprise in  lihua electron was thus entitled to the eit exemption in and  and has been subject to the income tax reduction for the period from to set out in the following table are the eit rates for our two prc operating companies from to lihua electron lihua copper results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales our business for the year ended december  continued to demonstrate robust growth 
net sales increased by from million in to million in this growth was primarily driven by i strong market demand in our cca and copper wire products  ii the launch of the new smelting capacity in the third quarter of  which increased capacity and allowed us to keep up with increased product demand  and iii he increase of copper prices during relative to please see the table below for more details regarding the product sales breakdown by specific category

foreign currency translation gains during the year ended december   the rmb rose slightly against the us dollar  and we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations  bank loans and fund raising through issuing new shares from capital market

investing activities for the year ended december  we had a net cash outflow of million from investing activities for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and deposits paid for new land use rights  primarily as a result of capital investment in new equipment and machinery and building of new workshops  all being part of our planned expansion 
financing activities for the year ended december   we had a net cash inflow of million from financing activities which was primarily driven by million proceeds from the fund raising through issuing new shares in the second quarter of and million proceeds from the exercise of warrants of the pipe investors 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures are principally comprised of construction and purchases of property  plant and equipment for expansion of our production facilities 
in   and  we funded our capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities and the proceeds of bank borrowings  and equity issuance 
in  as we accelerate our expansion  we expect continued capital expenditure for maintaining existing machines and adding manufacturing equipment in our new facility  which is adjacent to our existing facility 
we currently have two smelting facilities which can produce a total of  tons of refined copper products per year 
we plan to add additional smelting facilities in and increase our refined copper capacity to  tons per year 
with our current capacity of production lines  we can produce  tons of cca wire and  tons of copper wire 
we currently do not have any plans to add any new drawing capacities for for the capacity expansion  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs to bring all of our facilities into full production 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
accounts receivable in  we produced  tons of cca and copper wire   tons of copper anode and  tons of copper rod 
in  we produced  tons of cca and copper wire and  tons of copper rod 
as cca is an emerging product in the prc  lihua extends credit terms to some of its larger customers 
however  pure copper products  such as our copper anode  copper rod and copper wire  are in such high demand that we don t have to extend credit terms 
our customers often purchase more than one type of product from us for example  one customer may purchase both cca wire and copper wire 
cca wire purchases are generally accorded to day payment terms  depending upon the creditworthiness of the customer  while the copper wire and copper rod and anode purchases are payable upon delivery to the customer  which may occur two to seven days after we ship the product and recognize our revenue 
this decision to extend terms or to collect payment upon receipt essentially a cash sale  although due to the shipping time this effectively becomes a very short receivable  is based primarily upon the product type 
we may extend terms for cca purchases to a credit worthy customer  but for that same customer require payment upon delivery for purchases of copper anode  rod and or copper wire 
the table below shows the breakdown of accounts receivable by products as of december  accounts receivable accounts receivable cca wire and copper wire copper anode copper rod total off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk substantially all of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in renminbi 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollars and renminbi will affect our financial results in us dollars terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
the renminbi s exchange rate with the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in the prc s political and economic conditions 
the exchange rate for conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is heavily influenced by intervention in the foreign exchange market by the people s bank of china 
from until july  the people s bank of china intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately renminbi per us dollar 
on july   the prc government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the renminbi versus the us dollar 
however  the renminbi is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than per day versus the us dollar  and the people s bank of china continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate 
nevertheless  under china s current exchange rate regime  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the us dollar 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
on the other hand  the appreciation of the renminbi could make our customers products more expensive to purchase because many of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as of december  and  we have cash denominated in renminbi amounting to rmb million million and rmb million million 
also  from time to time we may have us dollar denominated borrowings 
accordingly  a decoupling of the renminbi many affect our financial performance in the future 
we recognized a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately rmb million million for the year ended december  very limited hedging transactions are available in the prc to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currency 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from short term variable rate borrowings from time to time 
our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates 
we believe our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risks is not material 
our bank borrowings amounted to rmb million million as of december  based on the variable nature of the underlying interest rate  the bank borrowings approximated fair value at that date 
if there was a hypothetical change in interest rates  the net impact to earnings and cash flows would be approximately rmb  
the potential change in cash flows and earning is calculated based on the change in the net interest expense over a one year period due to an immediate change in price 
inflation in recent years  the prc has not experienced significant inflation  and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in   and respectively
