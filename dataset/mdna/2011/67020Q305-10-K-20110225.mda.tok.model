you should read the following discussion of our financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included herein item 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of these risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia  west virginia and parts of maryland  pennsylvania  ohio and kentucky 
our primary services are wireless digital personal communications services pcs  local and long distance telephone services  high capacity transport  data services for internet access and wide area networking and iptv based video services 
our wireless operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail business and a wholesale business which primarily relates to an exclusive contract with sprint 
we believe our regional focus  contiguous service area  and leveraged use of our network via our wholesale contract with sprint provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  most of whom are national providers 
our wireless revenues accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our wireless retail business had approximately  ntelos retail subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 
as of december    approximately of our total cell sites contain evolution data optimized revision a ev do technology  which provides us with the technical ability to support high speed mobile wireless data services 
we have an agreement with sprint spectrum lp to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area to sprint for all sprint cdma wireless customers 
for the years ended december  and  we realized wireless wholesale revenues of million and million  respectively 
of this total for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  related to the strategic network alliance 
following a contractual travel data rate reset on july   our monthly calculated revenue from sprint under this contract fell below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract from the july travel data rate reset through september  over the past months  however  calculated revenues have continued to increase toward this minimum  and revenues from this contract exceeded the monthly minimum during the fourth quarter of and are projected to exceed the monthly minimum during our wireline operations include the rural local exchange carrier rlec segment and the competitive wireline segment 
our wireline operating income margins were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
founded in  our wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business is conducted through two subsidiaries that qualify as rlecs under the telecommunications act 
these two rlecs provide wireline communications services to residential and business customers in the western virginia cities of waynesboro and covington  and portions of alleghany  augusta and botetourt counties 
as of december   we operated approximately  rlec telephone access lines 
our wireline business is supported by an extensive fiber optic network with approximately  route miles 
we utilize the network to backhaul communications traffic for retail services and to serve as a carriers carrier network  providing transport services to third parties for long distance  internet  wireless and private networks 
our fiber optic network is connected to and marketed with adjacent fiber optic networks in the mid atlantic region 
on december   we closed on an agreement to purchase certain fiber optic and network assets and related transport and data service contracts from allegheny energy  inc the purchase included approximately  route miles of fiber located primarily in central and western pennsylvania and west virginia  with portions also in maryland  kentucky and ohio 
with this expansion of our fiber optic network  we began to accelerate our growth initiatives in our competitive wireline enterprise business in certain west virginia  maryland and pennsylvania local markets 

table of contents we leverage our wireline network infrastructure to offer competitive voice and data communication services outside our rlec coverage area through our competitive wireline segment 
within our competitive wireline segment  we market and sell local and long distance  voice and data services almost exclusively to business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier clec and internet service provider isp operation 
as of december   we served customers with approximately  clec access line connections excluding the connections we obtained from the fibernet acquisition 
we also offer broadband services in over of our rlec service area and as of december   we operated approximately  broadband access connections in our markets excluding the connections we obtained from the fibernet acquisition  representing an increase of over the connections on december  we also offer ntelos video in selected neighborhoods within our two rlec service areas and in two clec neighborhoods 
the product offers video entertainment services and provides an alternative to cable and satellite tv 
it is delivered via fiber to the home ftth which allows us to deliver integrated video  local and long distance telephone services  plus broadband internet access at speeds currently up to megabits per second 
at december   we had approximately  video customers and passed approximately  homes with fiber 
revenues and operating expenses from the broadband and video products are included in the competitive wireline segment 
on december   we closed on a purchase agreement with one communications corp 
to acquire its fibernet business for net cash consideration of approximately million 
the fibernet fiber optic network covers all of west virginia and extends into surrounding areas in ohio  maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and kentucky 
fibernet offers retail voice and data services  transport and ip based services primarily to regional retail and wholesale business customers 
we funded the purchase through a combination of proceeds from a million incremental term loan under our existing senior credit facility which we closed on august  and cash on hand 
through this acquisition  we obtained approximately  customer accounts and approximately new route miles of fiber 
many of the market risk factors which affected our results of operations in affected our results of operations in and will continue in additionally  the impact of overall unfavorable economic conditions and increased competition that we experienced throughout continued in in wireless  we are continuing to make network improvements  including network expansion and cell site additions 
during the second quarter of  we expanded our wireless service into one additional new market hagerstown  maryland  increasing our covered population by approximately  we also plan to increase and improve our points of distribution in our existing markets  particularly with our indirect distribution channel 
additionally  we are continuing to improve our handset offerings and refine plans  features and communication to customers 
finally  we will continue to improve and enhance our network  particularly within our existing service coverage areas 
all of these initiatives support our commitment to deliver superior customer value and experience 
the current economic climate and increased competition has contributed to a slight decline in subscribers from as prepay plan customer decline has outpaced postpay customer growth 
however  by investing in further customer retention programs and increasing the percentage of subscribers under contract  we were able to stabilize total churn from to additionally  we have increased the percentage of sales of nations plans  which historically have had the lowest churn rates  to approximately of total postpay sales during as compared to an average of approximately in with our postpay products  these improvements coupled with an increase in gross customer additions in the second half of have resulted in more than  net postpay customer additions in the second half of we are focused on refining our distribution strategy with respect to both our prepay and postpay sales 
we have begun expanding our indirect distribution channel using master agents and exclusive dealers and increasing the points of distribution and the quality of the indirect locations 
this will continue into  as will a focused improvement to our direct distribution channel with changes to the number of stores  store locations and upgrades to our stores in appearance and customer service functionality 
we believe these changes will improve our prepay sales and also bolster postpay sales productivity 
we continue to face risks to our competitive value position in the postpay market  including through reduced price nationwide unlimited voice plans by competitors such as at t  verizon and us cellular 
we expect postpay competition to continue to be intense as the market gets closer to saturation and carriers focus on taking market share from competitors 
we also expect the increased competition with prepaid products to remain intense as competitors have targeted this segment as a means to sustain growth and increase market share 
competition in the wireless prepay market has continued to evolve since a number of large wireless competitors  including 
table of contents boost and virgin mobile operated by sprint  tracfone s straight talk service  t mobile  net and page plus  have been actively competing in the prepaid market over the last two years 
many of these competitors have access to big box retailers and convenience stores that are unavailable to us 
pricing competition in the prepaid market also intensified during the fourth quarter of and in with the introduction of a number of prepaid unlimited nationwide plans for less than per month 
to remain competitive with our prepaid product offerings  we launched the frawg unlimited wireless product in the richmond and hampton roads  virginia markets late in the second quarter of and in the remainder of our markets in the third quarter of frawg is a simple  low cost service that has a minimum number of plans  offers attractive features and provides regional or national unlimited coverage 
this no contract offer requires a higher retail price on the handset in exchange for a variety of plans featuring competitive price points 
acquisition costs are substantially lower than postpay with the reduced handset subsidy and lower selling and advertising costs 
during  we refined our prepaid strategic focus to target the higher end of the prepaid market offering more feature rich plans to higher priced plans and increased pricing of the lower end frawg rate plans 
this slowed gross customer additions considerably with our prepaid products in the last half of and resulted in a net customer loss of  of the prepaid customer base in  as discussed further in the wireless communications revenues section below 
average monthly revenue per handset unit in service arpu from voice declined in and is expected to continue to decline in due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
however  we anticipate data arpu will continue to grow and offset a substantial portion of the decline in voice arpu 
our wireless network upgrade to ev do has helped increase retail data arpu by for the year ended december  over the year ended december  higher handset subsidy costs as compared to were experienced in and are expected to continue in due to actual and expected higher mix of smart phones associated with the projected growth in data arpu 
data arpu and data revenue are expected to continue to grow in due to the continued increase in penetration and usage escalating from our ev do deployment  however  this upgrade has resulted in a significant increase in network expenses which is captured in cost of sales and services 
wireless capital expenditures for decreased significantly from as the network upgrade to ev do was completed in our primary strategy in wireline is to promote our competitive wireline segment strategic products  particularly high capacity network access and transport services marketed to large enterprise and government customers and other carriers  extend our competitive wireline segment network to increase the addressable market area and leverage our strong incumbent market position to increase our revenue by cross selling additional services to our ilec customer base 
toward this pursuit  we have more than new potential markets that are available to us as a result of the addition of approximately  fiber route miles to our network in late and the addition of over new fiber route miles with the acquisition of fibernet in late the fibernet purchase also provides further diversity and density in several of our existing markets  particularly in west virginia 
we plan to offer additional data and other broadband services to existing fibernet customers and attract new customers in our existing and new markets with our strategic products  in order to grow top line revenue and further leverage our operational and back office platforms  and  at the same time  fully realize the operational synergies available 
we are particularly targeting large enterprise customers with our enterprise based service solutions 
throughout all markets  we will continue to extend our network to customers in order to improve the network quality  eliminate access related expenses and control the customer experience 
in the rlec segment  we experienced access line losses in and and these losses are expected to continue in due to continued cable competition  wireless substitution and the economic climate 
we lost approximately  access lines during these line losses  coupled with mid year rate reductions as a result of our biennial tariff filing with the fcc for ntelos telephone  contributed to a decline in rlec revenues for compared to our fiber to the home deployment in our rlec markets significantly reduces churn in the areas where it is offered 
in  we received a federal broadband stimulus award to bring broadband services and infrastructure to alleghany county  virginia 
the total project is million  of which million will be funded by a grant from the federal government 
we commenced this project and incurred million of total project costs in and began offering higher speed broadband services in alleghany county in the fourth quarter of the project is expected to be completed in 
table of contents other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles gaap throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as arpu to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
wireless arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other wireless companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our wireless rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value wireless customers 
arpu is not a frequently compared measure with wireline companies due to the diversity of service and product offerings among wireline companies 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenue from our wireless segment note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands  other than average monthly arpu data wireless communications revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale revenues less other revenues and adjustments wireless gross subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total average monthly arpu pro forma total average monthly arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less wireless voice and other features revenues wireless data revenues average number of subscribers total data average monthly arpu we entered into a new agreement with more favorable terms to provide handset insurance to wireless subscribers  effective april  due to the differences in the terms of this new arrangement  revenues for handset insurance are no longer reported on a gross basis  but on a net basis instead 
this has led to a reduction in total arpu from the comparative twelve month period in historical periods have not been restated 
operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories wireless pcs  consisting of retail revenues from network access  data services  equipment revenues and feature services  and wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance and roaming from other carriers  
table of contents competitive wireline segment revenues  including revenues from our strategic products local services  broadband voice and data services  high capacity network access and transport services and iptv based video services and from legacy competitive wireline products long distance  dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation  rlec segment revenues  including local service  network access  toll and directory advertising  and other communications services revenues  including primarily revenues from paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 
operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of sales and services  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  particularly with handsets sold with service contracts  we sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end user customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations and engineering and repairs and maintenance expenses related to property  plant and equipment  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  publication of regional telephone directories  customer care  directory services  customer retention and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses and equity based compensation expense related to stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management and expenses related to acquisitions and the proposed business separation  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable  and accretion of asset retirement obligations aro 
other income expenses our other income expenses are generated incurred from interest expense on debt instruments  changes in fair value of our interest rate cap and our interest rate swap instrument  which was terminated during the august refinancing  and other income expense  which includes interest income and fees and expenses related to senior secured credit facility amendments which do not result in a material change to terms and are therefore not deferred 
income taxes our income tax expense and effective tax rate increases or decreases based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  state minimum tax assessments  and non deductible expenses 
noncontrolling interests in losses earnings of subsidiaries we have an rlec segment partnership with a noncontrolling interest that owns certain signaling equipment and provides service to a number of small rlecs and to tns an interoperability solution provider 
also  our virginia pcs alliance  lc  or the va alliance  that provides pcs services to a million populated area in central and western virginia  has a noncontrolling interest 
the va alliance incurred cumulative operating losses from the time it initiated pcs services in until the second quarter of despite this  in accordance with the noncontrolling interest adoption requirements fasb asc  which we adopted on january   we attribute of va alliance net income to these noncontrolling interests 
no capital contributions from the minority owners were made during the years ended december  or the va alliance made million of capital distributions to the minority owners during each of the years ended december  and 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues decreased million  or  from to this decrease was driven by a decrease in wireless pcs revenues of million  or  resulting from declines in subscriber revenues  wholesale revenues and equipment revenues 
wireline revenues increased million  or  over despite a million decline in rlec revenues  due to growth in strategic product revenues in the competitive wireline segment  including revenues associated with the fiber optic assets acquired from allegheny energy  inc on december  and revenues associated with the purchase of fibernet on december  operating income decreased million  or  from due to the decline in revenue discussed above and an increase in operating expenses of million  or 
the increase in operating expenses is due to increases in customer and corporate operations expense  inclusive of an increase of million from expenses related to acquisitions  the proposed business separation  restructuring and equity based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in cost of sales and services and depreciation expense  as discussed in the operating expenses section further below 
net income attributable to ntelos holdings corp 
decreased million  or  from to in addition to the million decrease in operating income  other expenses net of other income  increased by million primarily relating to a million increase in interest expense due to the august refinancing and the million incremental term loan borrowing in august  as discussed further under other income expenses below  and the prior year favorable change in interest rate swap value of million 
these decreases to pre tax income were offset by a million decrease in income tax expense 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues by business segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline competitive wireline rlec total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues decreased million from to primarily due to a million  or  decrease in our net retail subscriber revenue  a million  or  decrease in wholesale and roaming revenues and a million  or  decrease in equipment revenues 
subscriber revenues reflected a net subscriber loss of approximately  subscribers  or  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  during the third quarter of  we introduced several initiatives to increase postpay subscriber additions  as a result  postpay subscriber net additions were over  in the second half of  ending with a net postpay subscriber loss of less than conversely  we experienced net prepay subscriber losses in each of the last three quarters of  ending with a net prepay subscriber loss of over  voice and other feature revenues  excluding data revenues  were lower in than in by million due to a number of factors  including the decrease in the subscriber base and a decline in total average monthly arpu excluding average monthly data arpu  due to competitive pricing reductions  economic conditions and an increase in the number of prepay subscribers who suspend service for a period of time 
partially offsetting the decrease in voice revenue was an increase in data revenue of million over underlying this growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do and an increased sales emphasis on smart phones and 
table of contents other data centric handsets coupled with a broader array of data packages and increased sales of data cards 
total data arpu for all prepay and postpay products was for compared to for  an increase of  reflecting the increased take rate on data packages and increased usage rates 
growth in data arpu partially offset declines in voice arpu  resulting in blended arpu of for as compared to for in response to competitive conditions  we launched the frawg unlimited wireless product in the richmond and hampton roads  virginia markets late in the second quarter of and in all of our remaining markets during frawg provides prepay wireless options at lower  competitive price points along with reduced subsidy and sales costs to us 
for  frawg accounted for approximately of prepay gross subscriber additions as compared to approximately in the prior year which has contributed to lower arpu levels than the traditionally higher arpu prepay rate plans  albeit at a lower net subsidy cost and lower churn 
prepay sales in total have declined in the second  third and fourth quarters of as compared to the prior year comparative periods 
wholesale and roaming revenues from the strategic network alliance decreased million  or  from the year to date revenue decrease from the strategic network alliance is reflective of data usage which was billable at substantially higher contractual preset rates in until the july  contractual travel data rate reset 
following the travel data rate reset  our monthly calculated revenue from sprint was below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract from july  through september  however  calculated revenues from the strategic network alliance continued to grow with significant usage growth and began to exceed the million monthly minimum in october we expect these revenues to exceed the monthly minimum throughout roaming revenues from other carriers decreased million from roaming revenues from other carriers may decline in as a result of industry consolidation of carriers with complementary networks  lower roaming rates or from other roaming arrangements which may not be favorable to us 
our wholesale revenues derived from the strategic network alliance are primarily from the voice usage by sprint and sprint affiliate customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home minutes of use  those customers of sprint who use our network for voice services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel minutes of use and data usage by sprint customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
we added nine cell sites within this wholesale service area from december  to december   improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million  or  over  with revenues from the allegheny asset acquisition of nearly million in and revenues from the fibernet acquisition of nearly million in note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
also increasing in were revenues from strategic products in our other markets  which increased million  or 
these increases were primarily offset by a million  or  decrease in rlec revenues and a million decrease in legacy competitive wireline segment revenues 
competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue increased million over  inclusive of the aforementioned increase related to the allegheny and fibernet acquisitions 
strategic product revenues from our other markets increased million over primarily from increases in broadband voice and data services  which include broadband over fiber  dedicated internet access  dsl  integrated access and metro ethernet  and from increases in transport revenue 
revenues from legacy products  including dial up internet  reciprocal compensation and switched access  decreased million from rlec revenues 
rlec revenues decreased million  or  from primarily due to decreased access and local service revenues from a decrease in access lines and a million decrease related to carrier access dispute adjustments 
also reflected in the decrease was a decrease in carrier access minutes due primarily to a decline in usage by wireless carriers 
on july   our interstate access rates were subject to a biennial reset reduction 
this rate reset coupled with network grooming by our customers contributed to the aforementioned revenue reduction 
access lines totaled approximately  as of december  and approximately  as of december  this access line loss is reflective of residential wireless substitution  the effect of current economic conditions on businesses and competitive voice service offerings from comcast in one of our three rlec markets 
additionally  we encountered new voice competition in another rlec market from shenandoah telecommunications in which has resulted in greater residential line losses than we experienced in 
table of contents operating expenses the following table identifies our operating expenses by business segment  consistent with the tables presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating expenses variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline competitive wireline rlec total wireline other operating expenses  before equity based compensation charges  voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans  acquisition related charges  proposed business separation charges  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations equity based compensation voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans acquisition related charges   n m proposed business separation charges n m depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations total operating expenses operating expenses the following describes our operating expenses by segment and on a basis consistent with our financial statement presentation 
the discussion below relates to our operating expenses by segment before equity based compensation charges  voluntary early retirement plan and workforce reductions  expenses related to acquisitions and the proposed business separation  depreciation and amortization  and accretion of asset retirement obligations wireless communications the operating expense decrease in wireless communications from was primarily due to a million decrease in cost of sales cos largely offset by an increase in retention expense of million 
the decrease in cos and related increase to retention expense was partially driven by a decrease in equipment cos of million primarily due to a change in the classification of handset returns and exchanges from cos in the prior year to retention expense included in customer operations expense on the consolidated statement of operations in the current year 
the remainder of the decrease in cos was primarily driven by a decrease in roaming costs of million as a result of in network roaming savings associated with continued cell site expansion and lower roaming rates from our roaming partners  a million decrease in data cos primarily driven by favorable rate reductions  a million decrease in features cos and a million decrease in toll cos 
we expect cos expenses to grow during as roaming volume from national and unlimited plans increases  sales of smart phones and data cards continue at current or increased levels  and usage of data features increases 

table of contents in addition to the cos decrease from described above  bad debt expense decreased million due to improvement in accounts receivable aging and employee compensation and benefits  including employee sales commissions  decreased million due to a decrease in headcount and a decrease in sales commissions relative to lower gross subscriber additions 
partially offsetting these decreases from was an increase in retention expense of million  as discussed above 
agent commissions and other selling expenses increased million due to a increase in indirect sales over we expect this to continue to increase in as we further develop this distribution channel 
cell site and network access expenses increased million over related to additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network  strong growth in data usage by subscribers  and related to a increase in the number of cell sites as of december  over december  in  we invested capital for network efficiency improvements which partially offset the increases in cell site and network expenses noted above 
going forward  we expect that growth in usage will be the primary contributor of higher cell site and network access costs 
the remainder of the operating expenses which increased from totaled approximately million and include general and administrative costs allocated from the corporate department  repairs and maintenance  materials and supplies and other direct general and administrative costs 
wireline communications the increase noted in the table above is primarily attributable to more than million and nearly million increase in operating expenses related to the new allegheny markets and the fibernet acquisition  respectively note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
operating expenses from the rlec segment and the remaining markets in the competitive wireline segment increased million  less than  collectively from reflective of continuing network grooming and increasing the percentage of on network traffic 
other other operating expenses decreased million  or  from the primary operating expenses in this segment are compensation and benefits and third party professional fees 
the results for include the recognition of severance benefits totaling million which were provided for in the employment agreement of an executive officer who left the company in march the results for include the recognition of a million signing bonus paid to our then new president and chief operating officer 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services decreased million  or  from to as discussed above  wireless variable cos decreased million from largely related to the expense classification change from equipment cos to retention expense included in customer operations expenses and expense decreases related to roaming and data cos 
partially offsetting this decrease in variable cos was an increase in cell site and network access costs of million over primarily related to an increase in the number of cell sites over december  and additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network and increased data usage  as described above 
repairs and maintenance expenses also increased million over which were largely weather related 
the remainder of offsetting increases relates to a million increase in accruals for the company s annual discretionary cash bonus which is driven by the company s performance relative to target objectives 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to retention costs increased million  of which million relates to a reclassification of handset returns and exchanges  as discussed in the wireless communications section above 
third party agent commissions increased million due to an increase in sales through this channel 
direct channel commissions decreased million due primarily to volume 
accruals for the company s annual discretionary cash bonus increased million over and equity based compensation expense increased million related to an increase in equity awards for employees of the company during and miscellaneous other expenses collectively increased million 
partially offsetting these net increases were decreases in bad debt expense of million and other compensation and benefits reductions of million  principally related to pension and other benefit plans 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expense increased million  or  from to results for include million of legal and professional fees related to the acquisition of fibernet note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual 
table of contents report on form k and a charge of million related to severance benefits which were provided for in the employment agreement of an executive officer who left the company in march the increase over is also attributable to a million increase in accruals for the company s annual discretionary cash bonus and a million increase in equity based compensation expense 
other notable increases include legal and professional fees  operating taxes  recruitment and hiring  contracted services and license  fees and royalties  which collectively increased million over partially offsetting these increases over was a decrease in other compensation and benefits of million 
also partially offsetting these increases over are several charges that were included in the results for but not in these charges include costs of million relating to a voluntary early retirement plan and severance related to a workforce reduction  charges of million for the recognition of a signing bonus paid to our then new president and chief operating officer and charges of million relating to a bonus for our president and chief operating officer who was promoted to chief executive officer and president in december and compensation related to a retirement agreement for our former chief executive officer 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  from to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in accelerated depreciation of million related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced earlier than originally anticipated in connection with the ev do upgrade  covering approximately of total cell sites as of december   which was completed by june  aside from the accelerated depreciation discussed above  depreciation expense increased million  or  and amortization expense increased million  or  related to the addition of a customer list intangible asset from the allegheny asset acquisition on december  and customer and other amortizable intangible assets from the fibernet acquisition on december  note and note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge was flat from to other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments increased million  or  from due primarily to the refinancing of our senior credit facility on august  upon refinancing  the senior credit facility was increased by over million and the interest rate increased to as compared to the weighted average blended rate in of 
interest expense also increased due to the additional borrowing of million on august  under the existing senior credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to fund the fibernet acquisition note in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
also  amortization of discount and origination costs were million higher than additionally  we recorded million in related to the interest portion of an access revenue settlement related to a carrier access billing dispute 
we recorded a gain from the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap instrument in of million 
in august  ntelos inc terminated this interest rate swap agreement 
we entered into an interest rate cap instrument in fourth quarter and recognized a million loss due to the change in market value from the date of purchase to december  
table of contents other income expenses decreased million from net expense of million for the year ended december  to net expense of million for the year ended december  for  other income expense primarily includes expenses of million related to amendments of our credit agreement to accommodate terms and conditions associated with two federal broadband stimulus grants we received in  as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
other income expenses for primarily includes expenses of million related to the write off of deferred fees associated with our prior senior secured credit facility which was paid in full in connection with the august refinancing noted above 
the remaining immaterial amounts in other income expenses primarily relate to interest income from cash which increased slightly from the previous periods due to maintaining higher cash balances in investment accounts 
income taxes income tax expense for was million with an effective rate of  representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of certain non deductible compensation  noncontrolling interests  and other non deductible expenses 
we expect our recurring non deductible expenses to relate primarily to certain non cash share based compensation  and other non deductible compensation 
for  the amounts of these charges for equity based awards outstanding as of december   and other non deductible compensation are expected to be million and million  respectively 
income taxes for were million with an effective rate of 
the effective rate was driven down in by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
we have unused net operating losses  including certain built in losses nols totaling million as of december  these nols are subject to an adjusted annual maximum limit the irc limit of million 
based on the irc limit  we expect to use nols of approximately million as follows million per year in through  million in and million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  from to wireless pcs accounted for approximately the increase  with growth occurring primarily from wholesale revenues 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from growth in key strategic product revenues in the competitive wireline segment  partially offset by a decline in revenue from the rlec segment 
operating income increased million over operating margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in operating income and the margin expansion for the year are attributable to the fact that operating expenses decreased from the comparative year  primarily driven by a decrease in accelerated depreciation as discussed further below 
net income attributable to ntelos holdings corp 
increased million  or  over in addition to the million increase in operating income  other expenses net of other income  decreased by million primarily relating to the change in interest rate swap which was favorable by million  from a loss of million in the year ended december  to a gain of million in the year ended december  these increases to net income were primarily offset by a million increase in income tax expense 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues by business segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline competitive wireline rlec total wireline other total 
table of contents wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from to due to an increase in our net retail subscriber revenue of million  or  a million  or  increase in equipment revenue and an million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues 
subscriber revenues reflected net subscriber growth of approximately  subscribers  or  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  churn with certain prepaid products and a shift to a higher content of prepaid as compared to postpay gross subscriber additions reduced subscriber revenue growth 
data revenue increased million  but was mostly offset by a decline in voice revenues brought about by competitive pricing reductions and economic conditions which contributed to subscribers changing to or purchasing lower priced plans  the mix shift noted above and an increase in the number of prepay subscribers who suspend service for a period of time 
underlying the growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do deployed to of our cell sites as of december   and an increased sales emphasis on smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with a broader array of data packages and increased sales of data cards 
total data arpu for all prepay and postpay products was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of  reflecting the increased take rate on data packages and increased usage rates 
growth in data arpu has partially offset declines in voice arpu  leading to blended arpu of for as compared to for  a decrease 
pro forma of the handset insurance reporting change see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above  blended arpu decreased 
in response to competitive pressures  we launched the frawg unlimited wireless brand in the richmond and hampton roads  virginia markets late in the second quarter of frawg provides prepay wireless options at lower  competitive price points along with reduced subsidy and sales costs to us 
for the second half of  the launch of frawg contributed to a higher mix of prepay sales at lower arpu levels than the traditionally higher arpu postpay rate plans  albeit at a lower net subsidy cost from the prepay sales 
the launch of frawg  coupled with the current economic environment and competitive pricing  could result in further declines in voice related arpu which we anticipate will be partially offset by growth in data arpu 
the increase in wholesale and roaming revenue was driven by a million  or increase in revenue from the strategic network alliance 
additionally  roaming revenues from other carriers grew million over the comparative year 
the revenue increase from the strategic network alliance is reflective of the significant growth in data usage which was billable at substantially higher contractual preset rates in the prior year and up until the july  contractual travel data rate reset 
following the travel data rate reset  our monthly calculated revenue from sprint was below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract 
revenue from this contract is projected to remain at that level throughout accordingly  due to the first half of wholesale revenues being above the million minimum per month  we would expect a decline of approximately million in if wholesale revenue remains at the million per month minimum as expected 
also  roaming revenues from other carriers may decline in as a result of industry consolidation of carriers with complementary networks or from other roaming arrangements which may not be favorable to us 
our wholesale revenues derived from the strategic network alliance are primarily from the voice usage by sprint and sprint affiliate customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home minutes of use  those customers of sprint who use our network for voice services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel minutes of use and data usage by sprint customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
we added cell sites within this wholesale service area from december  to december   improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
the strategic network alliance extends through july  and is subject to automatic three year extensions unless certain notice provisions are exercised 
the agreement prohibits sprint from directly or indirectly commencing construction of  contracting for or launching its own wireless communications network in the agreement territory until a maximum of months prior to the end of the agreement 
the agreement specifies a series of usage rates for various types of services 
the voice rate pricing under the agreement was fixed through july   but provides for volume discounts based on sprint s voice revenue yield on that date and thereafter semi annually to provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
data rates for sprint in market home subscribers are on a per subscriber basis 
the data rate for sprint customers that are traveling through the territory and use the network is on a per kilobyte basis 
this rate is reset quarterly 
the strategic network alliance also permits our ntelos branded customers to access sprint s national wireless network at reciprocal rates as the sprint travel rates

broadband voice and data services include broadband over fiber  dedicated internet access  dsl  integrated access and metro ethernet 
revenues from these services increased million  or 
additionally  revenues from iptv based video services increased million to million driven by growth in customers 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues decreased million from the prior year primarily due to decreased access and local service revenues as a result of a decrease in access lines  partially offset by a increase in carrier access minutes due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
on july   our interstate access rates were subject to a biennial reset reduction 
this rate reset coupled with network grooming by our customers resulted in an annual reduction in revenue of approximately million 
access lines totaled approximately  as of december  and  as of december  this access line loss is reflective of residential wireless substitution  the effect of current economic conditions on businesses  the introduction of competitive voice service offerings from comcast  which commenced in may in one of our three rlec markets  and the conversion of centrex lines to pbx trunks 
we expect that the competitive voice service competition will primarily be for residential customers 
we expect to encounter additional voice competition in the first quarter of which could result in greater line losses than experienced in and operating expenses the following table identifies our operating expenses by business segment  consistent with the table presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating expenses variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline competitive wireline rlec total wireline other operating expenses  before equity based compensation charges  charges from voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations equity based compensation voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations total operating expenses

the discussion below relates to our operating expenses by segment before equity based compensation charges  charges from our voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations wireless communications the operating expense increase in wireless communications over the comparative year was primarily due to increased costs of maintaining our network  combined with increases in selling and customer care expenses 
specifically  cell site and network access expenses increased million related to additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network  strong growth in data usage by subscribers and our increased subscriber base  and related to a increase in the number of cell sites as of december  over december  bad debt expense increased million over the comparative year due to an increase in involuntary churn particularly with lower credit class customers and the impact of the economy and retention costs increased million over the comparative year due to an increase in the volume and cost of handset swaps and upgrades driven from promotional pricing 
advertising expense increased million related to heavier advertising in response to competitive pressure and to promote the frawg unlimited prepay offering launched in the second quarter of in addition to the above  compensation  benefits and employee sales commissions increased a total of million over the comparative year primarily due to inflationary wage increases  an increase in pension expense as a result of lower pension plan asset values as of december  due to a significant decline in of the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the number of gross additions from the comparative year 
other notable increases were contracted services  bank charges and license fees and royalties  which collectively increased million over prior year 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other general and administrative expenses of million  with a decline in performance based compensation partially offset by normal increases in other expenses 
agent sales commissions also decreased million from the comparative year due to a decrease in sales generated from third party agents and the lower selling costs related to the frawg product 
the increase in wireless communications operating expenses for is partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales cos of million from this decrease in cos was primarily driven by a decrease in roaming costs of million as a result of in network roaming savings associated with continued cell site expansion and lower roaming rates from our roaming partners 
also  handset insurance cos decreased million from prior year related to the april  reporting change discussed in the other overview discussion section above 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in equipment cos of million over the prior year due to an increase in subscriber additions and an increase in handset sales to our handset insurance provider 
revenue from handset sales to new and existing customers has risen in over due to the increase in selection of smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with more data product offerings and capabilities and attractive handset pricing intended to attract new customers and encourage existing customers to renew their contracts 
this also led to a million increase in data cos 
wireline communications the decrease in wireline operating expenses noted in the table above is primarily attributable to decreases in general and administrative costs from lower performance based compensation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in access expense  other compensation and benefits and repair and maintenance expenses 
other the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to the recognition in the first 
table of contents quarter of of a million signing bonus paid to our new president and chief operating officer in consideration of compensation foregone by him by departing his previous employer before vesting dates 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  from to cell site and network access costs increased million over primarily related to an increase in the number of cell sites over december  and additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network  increased data usage and our increased subscriber base  as described above 
other notable increases were repairs and maintenance  materials and supplies  and other expenses incurred in the provisioning of service  which increased million collectively 
these increases were primarily offset by a million decrease in performance based compensation expense due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus in also included in cost of sales and services are variable cos 
as discussed above  wireless variable cos decreased million from customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to bad debt expense increased million over  reflecting a worsening of receivables aging and an increase in the amount of accounts written off 
advertising expenses increased million over related to an increase in promotions to combat the increase in competitive pressures and to promote the recently launched frawg unlimited prepay offering 
also  as discussed in the wireless communications section above  retention costs increased million over partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in performance based compensation expense due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus under this plan in all other selling and marketing related expenses collectively decreased million from primarily due to a decrease in third party agent commissions 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expense decreased million  or  from to this decrease includes a decrease of million related to charges in for a voluntary early retirement offered to select employees in the wireline division 
these charges primarily represent an enhanced pension benefit offered to the employees who accepted the early retirement offer 
additionally  performance based compensation expense decreased million from due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus under this plan in if the company meets its performance based compensation plan objectives in  we would expect to pay incentive bonuses for fiscal year  thus increasing the expense in partially offsetting these decreases was a charge of million in representing the signing bonus for our new president and chief operating officer who was hired in march discussed in other above 
also included in the results for were charges of million relating to a voluntary early retirement plan and severance related to a workforce reduction and charges of million relating to a bonus for our president and chief operating officer who was promoted to chief executive officer and president in december  and compensation related to a retirement agreement for our former chief executive officer 
the decrease was also partially offset by increases in professional fees  license fees and royalties and contracted services in over depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  from to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in accelerated depreciation of million from primarily related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced earlier than originally anticipated in connection with the ev do upgrade discussed below  which was complete in the service area covered by the strategic network alliance by december  and fully completed by june  in all areas planned for upgrade at this time of total cell sites 
amortization expense decreased million from due to the scheduled completion of amortization for a customer list intangible asset after the first quarter of offsetting this  normal depreciation increased million over due to the million increase in the average depreciable base  with significant investments in property  plant and equipment during and  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge decreased approximately million from 
table of contents other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  from to due primarily to the precipitous drop in libor rates and a lower debt balance from january to august due to million of debt repayments from september  to august  at which time the debt was refinanced see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resource section that follows

gain loss on interest rate swap instrument s increased million year over year  from a million loss in to a million gain in in august  ntelos inc terminated the interest rate swap agreement that commenced in september with a termination payment of million  inclusive of million of accrued unpaid interest 
this swap agreement was not designated as an interest rate hedge instrument for accounting purposes and  therefore  the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements until the termination date were recorded currently as gain loss on interest rate swap 
other income expenses includes million in the related to the write off of deferred fees associated with our prior senior secured credit facility which was paid in full in connection with the refinancing noted above 
the remaining immaterial amounts primarily relate to interest income from cash that declined from the previous periods due to lower investment interest rates and maintaining lower cash balances in interest bearing accounts 
income taxes income tax expense for was million  representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of certain non deductible compensation  and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million 
we expect our recurring non deductible expenses to relate primarily to certain non cash share based compensation  and other non deductible compensation 
for  the amounts of these charges for equity based awards outstanding as of december   and other non deductible compensation are expected to be million and million  respectively 
income taxes for were million  driven by non deductible  non cash equity based compensation

critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies for discussion herein 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  ntelos inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and those limited liability corporations where ntelos inc or certain of its subsidiaries  as managing member  exercises control 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue recognition policies the company recognizes revenue when services are rendered or when products are delivered  installed and functional  as applicable 
certain services of the company require payment in advance of service performance 
in such cases  the company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue ratably over the service period 
the company bills customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues 
these transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed 
the company earns revenue by providing access to and usage of its networks in both its wireline and wireless divisions 
local service and airtime revenues are recognized as services are provided 
wholesale revenues are earned by providing switched access and other switched and dedicated services  including wireless roamer management  to other carriers 
revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale 
pcs handset equipment sold with service contracts are generally sold at prices below cost  based on the terms of the service contracts 
the company recognizes the entire cost of the handsets at the time of sale 
the company evaluates related transactions to determine whether they should be viewed as multiple deliverable arrangements  which impact revenue recognition 
multiple deliverable arrangements are presumed to be bundled transactions and the total consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair value with certain limitations 
the company has determined that sales of handsets with service contracts related to 
table of contents these sales generated from company owned retail stores are multiple deliverable arrangements 
accordingly  substantially all of the nonrefundable activation fee revenues as well as the associated direct costs are allocated to the wireless handset and are recognized at the time of the sale based on the fact that the handsets are generally sold below cost and on the relative fair value evaluation 
however  revenue and certain associated direct costs for activations sold at third party retail locations are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship as the company is not a principal in the transaction to sell the handset and therefore any activation fees charged are fully attributable to the service revenues 
nonrefundable activation fee revenue and certain associated direct costs for transactions in segments other than wireless are deferred as they are not associated with multiple deliverable arrangements but are directly associated with the underlying service being provided over the applicable coverage period 
in all cases  the direct activation costs exceed the related activation revenues 
when deferral is appropriate  the company defers these direct activation costs up to but not in excess of the related deferred revenue 
the company periodically makes claims for recovery of access charges on certain minutes of use terminated by the company on behalf of other carriers 
the company recognizes revenue in the period that it is able to estimate the amount and when the collection of such amount is considered probable 
trade accounts receivable the company sells its services to residential and commercial end users and to other communication carriers primarily in virginia  west virginia and parts of maryland and pennsylvania 
the company has credit and collection policies to maximize collection of trade receivables and requires deposits on certain sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical results  current and expected trends and changes in credit policies 
management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables 
actual credit losses could differ from such estimates 
the company includes bad debt expense in customer operations expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
inventories and supplies the company s inventories and supplies consist primarily of items held for resale such as pcs handsets and accessories  and wireline business phones and accessories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined by reviewing current replacement cost  marketability and obsolescence 
long lived asset recovery long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  radio spectrum licenses  long term deferred charges  goodwill and intangible assets to be held and used 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated pursuant to the subsequent measurement guidance described in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge 
the company believes that no impairment indicators exist as of december  that would require it to perform impairment testing 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which the company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations 
buildings are depreciated over a year life and leasehold improvements  which are categorized in land and buildings  are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
network plant and equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill  franchise rights and radio spectrum licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
the company assesses the recoverability of indefinite lived assets annually on october and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company uses a two step process to test for goodwill impairment 
step one requires a determination of the fair value of each of the reporting units and  to the extent that this fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value including goodwill  the step two calculation of implied fair value of goodwill is not required and no impairment loss is recognized 
in testing for goodwill impairment  the company utilizes a combination of a discounted cash flow model and an analysis which allocates enterprise value to the reporting units 
the company s annual testing is performed as of october of each year 
the franchise rights value in the ilec reporting unit largely reflects the value associated with revenues generated from its customers and future customers based on being the incumbent local exchange carrier and tandem access provider in these rural markets 
the radio spectrum licenses relate primarily to pcs licenses in service in the markets that we serve 
the company utilizes the greenfield cash flow valuation method in its impairment testing for these assets 
the greenfield method is an income approach which isolates value to the specific assets being valued and then compares the values to the calculated enterprise value as a validity test 
the method is based on a number of assumptions under a start up scenario but considers the company s future projects in modeling the operating results as the business matures 
pension benefits and retirement benefits other than pensions ntelos inc sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements and were employed by ntelos inc prior to october  the pension plan was closed to ntelos inc employees hired on or after october  pension benefits vest after five years of plan service and are based on years of service and an average of the five highest consecutive years of compensation subject to certain reductions if the employee retires before reaching age and elects to receive the benefit prior to age sections and of the internal revenue code and erisa sections and establish minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans 
the minimum required contribution is generally equal to the target normal cost plus the shortfall amortization installments for the current plan year and each of the six preceding plan years less any calculated credit balance 
if plan assets less calculated credits are equal to or exceed the funding target  the minimum required contribution is the target normal cost reduced by the excess funding  but not below zero 
the company s policy is to make contributions to stay at or above the threshold required in order to prevent benefit restrictions and related additional notice requirements and is intended to provide not only for benefits based on service to date  but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
also  ntelos inc has nonqualified pension plans that are accounted for similar to its pension plan 
ntelos inc provides certain health care and life benefits for retired employees that meet eligibility requirements 
the company has two qualified nonpension postretirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually 
the life insurance plan is also contributory 
these obligations  along with all of the pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans  are ntelos inc obligations assumed by the company 
eligibility for the life insurance plan is restricted to active pension participants age as of january  neither plan is eligible to employees hired after april the accounting for the plans anticipates that the company will maintain a consistent level of cost sharing for the benefits with the retirees 
the company s share of the projected costs of benefits that will be paid after retirement is generally being accrued by charges to expense over the eligible employees service periods to the dates they are fully eligible for benefits 
ntelos inc also sponsors a contributory defined contribution plan under internal revenue code section k for substantially all employees 
the company s policy is to match of each participant s annual contributions for contributions up to of each participant s annual compensation and of each participant s annual contributions up to an additional of each participant s annual compensation 
company contributions vest after two years of service 
effective june   the company began funding its k matching contributions in shares of the company s common stock 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences

the company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and income tax expense  respectively 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of asu additionally  the new guidance will require entities to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company is currently assessing the impact of asu on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures  but does not believe it will have a material impact 
on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act 
the new legislation makes extensive changes to the current system of health care insurance and benefits 
this new health care legislation creates an income tax charge for companies that provide qualifying prescription drug coverage to medicare eligible retirees and which currently receive a nontaxable subsidy from the us government 
under the new health care legislation  income tax deductions for the cost of providing that prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of any subsidy received 
this change will cause companies to record a charge to earnings to write off a portion of their deferred tax assets related to postretirement health care obligations under current accounting requirements 
under fasb guidance  the effect of changes in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is reflected in the period that includes the enactment date  even though the changes may not be effective until future periods 
the subsidy that the company receives is not material and the expected impact of this new legislation is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements which amends the fasb s fair value measurements and disclosures requirements to require reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or non recurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the asu also clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs and valuation techniques 
the disclosures were included in this filing 
in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the task force in eitf a  intangibles goodwill and other topic  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this eitf modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
eitf a is effective for public entities for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
upon adoption of the eitf  an entity with reporting units that have carrying amounts that are zero or negative is required to assess whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired 
if the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill of one or more of its reporting units is impaired  the entity should perform step of the goodwill impairment test for those reporting unit s 
any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
the company is currently assessing the impact of this eitf on its consolidated financial statements upon the effective date of january  in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the task force in eitf g  business combinations topic  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
eitf g specifies 
table of contents that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity acquirer should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
eitf g also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
eitf g is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily related to interest rates 
as of december   million was outstanding under the first lien term loan 
as of december   ntelos inc had a leverage ratio of and an interest coverage ratio of  both of which are favorable to any future covenant requirement 
this facility bears interest at above either the eurodollar rate or  whichever is greater  or above either the federal funds rate or  whichever is greater 
we have other fixed rate  long term debt in the form of capital leases totaling million as of december  we have a million interest rate cap agreement which is used to manage our exposure to interest rate market risks and to comply with the terms and conditions of the first lien term loan 
this cap agreement helps minimize our exposure to interest rate movements by capping libor at 
we have interest rate risk on borrowings under the first lien term loan in excess of the million covered by the cap agreement million at december  
the cap agreement ends in august at december   our financial assets included cash of million 
other securities and investments totaled million at december  the following sensitivity analysis indicates the impact at december   on the fair value of certain financial instruments  which are potentially subject to material market risks  assuming a ten percent increase and a ten percent decrease in the levels of our interest rates in thousands book value fair value estimated fair value assuming noted decrease in market pricing estimated fair value assuming noted increase in market pricing first lien term loan capital lease obligations a ten percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a change of million in interest expense for  computed using the libor floor stipulated in our senior credit facility 
interest on our senior credit facility is calculated at the higher of libor rate or plus 
actual libor rates at december  were well below and thus  a change in the actual libor rate from the rate at december  would result in no change in interest expense in
