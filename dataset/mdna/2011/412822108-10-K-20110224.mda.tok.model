hdfs provides financing to the company s canadian distributor  harley davidson independent dealers and the retail customers of those dealers in the us and canada 
the company s independent distributors  dealers and their retail customers in the europe  asia pacific and latin america regions are not directly financed by hdfs  but have access to financing though other established financial services companies  some of which have licensing or branding agreements with the company 
seasonality the timing of retail sales made by the company s independent dealers tracks closely with regional riding seasons 
the seasonality of wholesale shipments made by the company has been different depending on the geographic market 
the company s independent dealers in the us and canadian markets typically have built their inventory levels in the late fall and winter in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
the availability of floor plan financing and financing assistance through hdfs has allowed dealers to manage these seasonal increases in inventory 
in the us  seasonal financing assistance is subsidized by the company  and in canada  seasonal financing assistance is sponsored by the region s single independent distributor  deeley harley davidson canada fred deeley imports ltd 
as a result  the company s wholesale shipments to these markets have historically not been affected to any material extent by seasonality 
in the majority of the remaining international markets  the company s wholesale shipments track more closely with regional riding seasons 
in general  the company s independent dealers and distributors in these international markets do not build inventory levels in the non riding seasons  and as a result  the company s wholesale shipments to these markets are generally lower in the non riding seasons than in the riding seasons 
the seasonality of the company s wholesale shipments affects its ability to produce on a level scale throughout the year

the company may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings 
unfavorable changes in the political  regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales  financial condition  profitability or cash flows 
the company must effectively execute the company s restructuring plans within expected costs 
during and  the company announced a combination of restructuring actions that are designed to reduce administrative costs  eliminate excess capacity and exit non core business operations 
effectively executing these plans within expected costs and realizing expected benefits will depend upon a number of factors  including the time required to complete planned actions  effective collaboration and agreement with the unions representing the company s employees  the absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions  availability of and effective use of third party service providers to assist in implementing the actions  avoidance of unexpected disruptions in production  retention of key employees involved in implementing the restructuring plans and the ability of the company to dispose of vacated facilities in a cost effective manner 
the company sells its products at wholesale and must rely on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of its products 
the company depends on the capability of its independent dealers and distributors to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers and distributors purchase from the company 
if the company s independent dealers and distributors are not successful in these endeavors  then the company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations 
further  independent dealers and distributors may experience difficulty in funding their day to day cash flow needs and paying their obligations because of weakened retail sales and tightening credit 
if dealers are unsuccessful  they may exit or be forced to exit the business or  in some cases  the company may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealerships 
as a result  the company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of dealer relationships 
additionally  liquidating a former dealer s inventory of new and used motorcycles can add downward pressure on new and used motorcycle prices

the company s dealers may experience a further decline in retail sales resulting from general economic conditions  tightening of credit  political events or other factors 
the motorcycle industry has been affected by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 
these factors have caused a weaker retail environment leading to weaker demand for discretionary purchases  and the decision to purchase a motorcycle has been and may continue to be affected by these factors 
the related tightening of credit has led to more limited availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the purchase of motorcycles from lenders  including hdfs 
should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand decline further  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be further substantially adversely affected 
the motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 

table of contents retail sales of the company s independent dealers may be adversely impacted by declining prices for used motorcycles and excess supplies of new motorcycles 
the company has observed that when prices for used harley davidson motorcycles have declined  it has had the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new harley davidson motorcycles at or near manufacturer s suggested retail prices 
also  while the company has taken steps designed to balance production volumes for its new motorcycles with demand  the company s competitors could choose to supply new motorcycles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which could also have the effect of reducing demand for new harley davidson motorcycles at or near manufacturer s suggested retail prices 
ultimately  reduced demand among retail purchasers for new harley davidson motorcycles leads to reduced shipments by the company 
the company may not be able to successfully execute its manufacturing strategy 
the company s manufacturing strategy is designed to continuously improve product quality and productivity  while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace 
the company believes flexible manufacturing  including flexible supply chains and flexible labor agreements  is the key element to enable improvements in the company s ability to respond to customers in a cost effective manner 
to implement this strategy  the company must be successful in its continuous improvement efforts which are dependent on the involvement of management  production employees and suppliers 
any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of the company s products and its ability to deliver the right product at the right time to the customer 
the company and its independent dealers must successfully adjust to a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
the company records the wholesale sale of a motorcycle when it is shipped to the company s independent dealers and distributors 
in the past several years  increased availability of new harley davidson motorcycles has resulted in the timing of retail purchases from the company s independent dealers tracking more closely with regional motorcycle riding seasons 
as a result  the company and its independent dealers and distributors must be able to successfully manage changes in production rates  inventory levels and other business processes to manage costs associated with a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
failure to adjust through the implementation of a more flexible manufacturing process or through adjustments to its methods of distributing motorcycles among its independent dealers and distributors may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company relies on third party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles 
the company cannot be certain that it will not experience supply problems such as unfavorable pricing or untimely delivery of raw materials and components 
in certain circumstances  the company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part  and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the company s production schedule 
in addition  the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the company s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material 
further  company suppliers may experience difficulty in funding their day to day cash flow needs because of tightening credit caused by financial market disruption 
in addition  adverse economic conditions and related pressure on select suppliers due to difficulties in the global manufacturing arena could adversely affect their ability to supply the company 
these supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s financial services operations rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations 
liquidity is essential to the company s financial services business 
disruptions in financial markets may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease to loan money to borrowers  including financial institutions 
the company s financial services operations may be negatively affected by the difficulty in raising capital in the long term and short term capital markets 
these negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in various ways  including through higher costs of capital  reduced funds available 
table of contents through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers  and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital 
the company s financial services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund their operations at competitive interest rates  the company s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings  and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations 
the ability of the company and its financial services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short term and long term credit ratings 
if the company s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings outlook is negatively changed  the company s cost of borrowing will increase  resulting in reduced earnings and interest margins  or the company s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired 
the company s financial services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale receivables 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer to meet the terms of any contract with the company s financial services operations 
credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions  including unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings and other factors that negatively affect household incomes  as well as contract terms  customer credit profiles and the new and used motorcycle market 
negative changes in general business  economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the company s financial services credit losses and future earnings 
credit losses are adversely impacted by increases in the frequency of loss and by decreases in the value of repossessed harley davidson branded motorcycles 
if there are adverse circumstances that involve a material decline in values of harley davidson branded motorcycles  those circumstances or any related decline in resale values for harley davidson branded motorcycles could contribute to increased delinquencies and credit losses 
the company has a number of competitors of varying sizes that are based both inside and outside the united states  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
many of the company s competitors are more diversified than the company  and they may compete in the automotive market or all segments of the motorcycle market 
also  the company s manufacturer s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors  and if price becomes a more important competitive factor for consumers in the heavyweight motorcycle market  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  the company s financial services operations face competition from various banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms  particularly for borrowers in higher credit tiers 
failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures worldwide and in the us may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s marketing strategy of appealing to and growing sales to multi generational and multi cultural customers worldwide may not continue to be successful 
the company has been successful in marketing its products in large part by promoting the experience of motorcycling 
to sustain and grow the business over the long term  the company must continue to be successful selling products and promoting the experience of motorcycling to both core customers and outreach customers such as women  young adults and ethnically diverse adults 
the company must also execute its multi generational and multi cultural strategy without adversely impacting the strength of the brand with core customers 
the company s success depends upon the continued strength of the harley davidson brand 
the company believes that the harley davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base 
failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the harley davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new  innovative and compliant products 
the motorcycle market continues 
table of contents to advance in terms of cutting edge styling and new technology and  at the same time  be subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions 
the company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors products with unique styling and new technologies and to protect its intellectual property from imitators 
in addition  these new products must comply with applicable regulations worldwide and satisfy the potential demand for products that produce lower emissions 
the company must make product advancements while maintaining the classic look  sound and feel associated with harley davidson products 
the company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to the marketplace in an efficient and timely manner 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the company s new products 
the company s motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor 
substantially all of the hourly production employees working in the motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
harley davidson motor company is currently a party to five collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers and the united steelworkers of america 
current collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in wisconsin  pennsylvania and kansas city will expire in  and  respectively 
new agreements were ratified in pennsylvania and wisconsin in december and september  respectively 
hourly production employees in missouri are expected to vote on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement in march with any agreement to be effective when the current agreement expires 
collective bargaining agreements generally cover wages  healthcare benefits and retirement plans  seniority  job classes and work rules 
there is no certainty that the company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms that will allow the company to be competitive 
failure to renew these agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the company and the unions could result in the relocation of production facilities  work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on customer relationships and the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees  including executive officers and other senior leaders 
the company s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate  retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of its organization 
the company s current and future total compensation arrangements  which include benefits and cash bonuses  may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating the company s existing employees 
if the company does not succeed in attracting new personnel  retaining existing personnel  implementing effective succession plans and motivating personnel  including executive officers  the company may be unable to develop and distribute products and services and effectively execute its plans and strategies 
the company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits 
the company s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and healthcare benefits for both active and retired employees are based on several factors that are outside the company s control 
these factors include funding requirements of the pension protection act of  the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the rate of return on plan assets  current and projected healthcare costs  healthcare reform or legislation  retirement age and mortality 
changes in these factors can impact the expense and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations  liquidity or shareholders equity 
in addition  costs associated with these benefits put the company under significant cost pressure as compared to our competitors that may not bear the costs of similar benefit plans 
the company manufactures products that create exposure to product liability claims and litigation 
to the extent plaintiffs are successful in showing that personal injury or property damage result from defects in the design or manufacture of the company s products  the company may be 
table of contents subject to claims for damages that are not covered by insurance 
the costs associated with defending product liability claims  including frivolous lawsuits  and payment of damages could be substantial 
the company s reputation may also be adversely affected by such claims  whether or not successful 
the company must maintain its reputation of being a good corporate citizen and treating customers  employees  suppliers and other stakeholders fairly 
the company believes it has a history of good corporate governance 
prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the act  the company had in place many of the corporate governance procedures and processes now mandated by the act and related rules and regulations  such as board committee charters and a corporate governance policy 
in  the company established a code of business conduct that defines how employees interact with various company stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality  conflict of interest and fair dealing 
failure to maintain this reputation may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company must invest in and successfully implement new information systems and technology 
the company is continually modifying and enhancing its systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency 
as new systems are implemented  the company could experience unanticipated difficulties resulting in unexpected costs and adverse impacts to its manufacturing and other business processes 
when implemented  the systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to ongoing operations  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the company s business  financial condition  reputation and brand 
the defense of the lawsuits may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  any such payment may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
refer to the company s disclosures concerning legal proceedings in the periodic reports that the company files with the securities and exchange commission for additional detail regarding lawsuits and other claims against the company 
the company must comply with governmental laws and regulations that are subject to change and involve significant costs 
the company s sales and operations in areas outside the us may be subject to foreign laws  regulations and the legal systems of foreign courts or tribunals 
these laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies may result in increased costs or restrictions on the ability of the company to sell its products in certain countries 
the company s international sales operations may also be adversely affected by united states laws affecting foreign trade and taxation 
the company is subject to income and non income based taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax liabilities and other tax liabilities 
the company believes that it complies with applicable tax law 
if the governing tax authorities have a different interpretation of the applicable law or if there is a change in tax law  our financial condition and or results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company s domestic sales and operations are subject to governmental policies and regulatory actions of agencies of the united states government  including the environmental protection agency epa  sec  national highway traffic safety administration  department of labor and federal trade commission 
in addition  the company s sales and operations are also subject to laws and actions of state legislatures and other local regulators  including dealer statutes and licensing laws 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 

table of contents the company s motorcycle products use internal combustion engines 
these motorcycle products are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise  including standards imposed by the epa  state regulatory agencies  such as california air resources board  and regulatory agencies in certain foreign countries where the company s motorcycle products are sold 
the company is also subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise in the conduct of the company s manufacturing operations 
any significant change to the regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise may substantially increase the cost of manufacturing the company s products 
further  in response to concerns about global climate changes  the company may face greater regulatory or customer pressure to develop products that generate less emissions 
this may require the company to spend additional funds on research  product development  and implementation costs and subject the company to the risk that the company s competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage 
the company s financial services operations are governed by various foreign  federal and state laws that more specifically affect general financial and lending institutions 
the financial services operations originate the majority of its consumer loans through its subsidiary  eaglemark savings bank  a nevada state thrift chartered as an industrial loan company 
the us congress is currently considering several proposals that would impose additional regulation and supervision over the financial services industry 
in  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act was passed into law 
the act is a sweeping piece of legislation  and the financial services industry is still assessing the impacts 
congress detailed some significant changes  but the act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study 
the full impact will not be fully known for months or even years  as regulations that are intended to implement the act are adopted by the appropriate agencies  and the text of the act is analyzed by impacted stakeholders and possibly the courts 
the act also created the bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb  housed in the federal reserve 
the cfpb has been granted significant rule making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services 
the direction that the cfpb will take  the regulations it will adopt  and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are all elements that are not yet known 
failure to comply with these regulations  changes in these or other regulations  or the imposition of additional regulations  could affect hdfs earnings  limit its access to capital  limit the number of loans eligible for hdfs securitization programs and have a material adverse effect on hdfs business and results of operations 
in addition  the company is also subject to policies and actions of the new york stock exchange nyse 
many major competitors of the company are not subject to the requirements of the sec or the nyse rules 
as a result  the company may be required to disclose certain information that may put the company at a competitive disadvantage to its principal competitors 
breaches of security involving consumer or employee personal data may adversely affect the company s reputation  revenue and earnings 
the company and certain of its third party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with its human resources operations  financial services operations  the harley owners group and other aspects of its business 
breach of the systems on which sensitive consumer or employee information is stored or other unauthorized release of consumer information may adversely affect the company s reputation and lead to claims against the company 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign country s local currency 
the company is also subject to risks associated with changes in prices of commodities 
earnings from the company s financial services business are affected by changes in interest rates 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to attempt to manage foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price and interest rate risks 
also  these transactions may expose the company to credit risk in the event of counterparty default to the derivative financial instruments 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will successfully manage these risks 

table of contents the company s operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 
in particular  climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide 
many scientists  legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
there have been bills pending in congress that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  several states  including states where the company has manufacturing plants  are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs 
energy security and availability and its related costs affect all aspects of the company s manufacturing operations in the united states  including the company s supply chain 
the company s manufacturing plants use energy  including electricity and natural gas  and certain of the company s plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts 
greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity the company purchases  increase costs for use of natural gas  potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas  require the company to purchase allowances to offset the company s own emissions or result in an overall increase in costs of raw materials  any one of which could increase the company s costs  reduce competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect the company s business  operations or financial results 
many of the company s suppliers face similar circumstances 
while additional regulation of emissions in the future appears likely  it is too early to predict how this regulation will ultimately affect the company s business  operations or financial results 
physical risks to the company s business operations as identified by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and other expert bodies include scenarios such as sea level rise  extreme weather conditions and resource shortages 
extreme weather may disrupt the production and supply of natural gas  a fuel necessary for the manufacture of motorcycles 
supply disruptions would raise market rates and jeopardize the continuity of motorcycle production

the york facility was formerly used by the us navy and amf prior to the purchase of the york facility by the company from amf in although the company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the york facility  it has been working with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep since in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities  including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs 
in january  the company entered into a settlement agreement the agreement with the navy 
the agreement calls for the navy and the company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to and  respectively  of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the york facility response costs 
the trust administers the payment of the response costs incurred at the york facility as covered by the agreement 
in february  the company was advised by the epa that it considers some of the company s remediation activities at the york facility to be subject to the epa s corrective action program under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and offered the company the option of addressing corrective action under a rcra facility lead agreement 
in july  the york facility was designated as the first site in pennsylvania to be addressed under the one cleanup program 
the program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both padep and epa and will be carried out consistent with the agreement with the navy 
as a result  the rcra facility lead agreement has been superseded 

table of contents although the ri fs is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the york facility  the company estimates that its share of the future response costs at the york facility will be approximately million 
the company has established reserves for this amount  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimate of the company s future response costs that will be incurred at the york facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the company  the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities 
response costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in response costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond product liability matters additionally  the company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business 
the company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures 
the company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

the increase in retail finance receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in off balance sheet term asset backed securitization activity throughout due to capital market volatility and the utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitization structures during the increase in wholesale outstanding finance receivables resulted from an increased use of floorplan financing combined with a higher number of average days financed

hdfs determined these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions 
given the 
table of contents challenging us economy  credit losses on hdfs retail finance receivables have increased  and as a result  the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined  and in some cases this decline is other than temporary 
a write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded  but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that hdfs expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests

the reclassification resulted in an additional provision for credit losses of million 
in addition  the provisions for credit losses related to retail receivables and wholesale receivables increased by million and million  respectively  over the increase was primarily the result of higher expected incidence of loss  lower expected recovery values on repossessed motorcycles  and an increase in the finance receivables held for investment

operating expenses were also impacted by a restructuring charge of million in as detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with hdfs 
as a result of the company s lower retail sales volume projections and the decline in operating performance at hdfs during due to significant write downs of its finance receivable portfolio and investment in retained securitization interests  the company performed an impairment test of the goodwill balance associated with hdfs as of june  the results of the impairment test indicated the current fair value of hdfs had declined below its carrying value 
other matters critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill the company reviews its goodwill for impairment  based on financial data related to the reporting unit to which it has been assigned  at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill must be adjusted to its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  the company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors  industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation 
asset groups to be disposed of by sale asset groups assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and a loss should be recognized for any initial adjustment required to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
the fair value less cost to sell must be assessed each reporting period the asset group remains classified as held for sale 
gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of an asset group will be recognized on the date of sale 
in determining the fair value of an asset group representing a business  the company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors  industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation 
in addition  the determination of fair value for an asset group held for sale may be influenced by information received from market participants interested buyers having appropriate knowledge of the asset group 
the appropriate level of knowledge may not be obtainable solely from public observations  but could be obtained in the course of a normal due diligence process 
off balance sheet finance receivable securitizations prior to  the company sold retail motorcycle finance receivables through securitization transactions utilizing qspes that qualified for accounting sale treatment under prior us gaap 
upon sale of retail finance receivables in a securitization transaction  hdfs received cash and retained an interest in excess cash flows  subordinated securities  and cash reserve account deposits  all of which were collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables 
retained interests were carried at fair value and were periodically reviewed for impairment 
market value quotes of fair value are generally not available for retained interests 
therefore  fair value was measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that incorporated management s best estimate of key assumptions that  in management s 
table of contents judgment  reflected the assumptions marketplace participants would use 
the impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hdfs retained servicing rights under retail finance receivables that it sold to the securitization trust and received a servicing fee 
the servicing fee paid to hdfs was considered adequate compensation for the services provided and was included in financial services revenue as earned 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted new accounting guidance within asc topic and asc topic as of january  that ultimately required the company to consolidate these formerly off balance sheet qspes 
gains or losses on securitizations from the sale of retail finance receivables were recorded as a component of financial services revenue and were based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses  prepayment speed and discount rates 
gains or losses on sales of retail finance receivables also depended on the original carrying amount of the retail finance receivables  which were allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
valuation of finance receivables held for sale finance receivables held for sale in the aggregate were carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
hdfs used discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporated appropriate assumptions for discount rate  funding costs and credit enhancement  as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that  in management s judgment  reflected assumptions marketplace participants would use 
any amount by which cost exceeded fair value was accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income 
allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables portfolio 
hdfs performs a periodic and systematic collective evaluation of the adequacy of the retail allowance 
hdfs utilizes loss forecast models which consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  historical loss trends  origination or vintage analysis  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral  recovery rates and current economic conditions including items such as unemployment rates 
the wholesale portfolio is primarily composed of large balance  non homogeneous finance receivables 
hdfs wholesale allowance evaluation is first based on a loan by loan review 
a specific allowance is established for wholesale finance receivables determined to be individually impaired when management concludes that the borrower will not be able to make full payment of contractual amounts due based on the original terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment is determined based on the cash that the company expects to receive discounted at the loan s original interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in establishing the allowance  management considers a number of factors including the specific borrower s financial performance as well as ability to repay 
finance receivables in the wholesale portfolio that are not considered impaired on an individual basis are segregated  based on similar risk characteristics  according to the company s internal risk rating system and collectively evaluated for impairment 
the related allowance is based on factors such as the company s past loan loss experience  current economic conditions as well as the value of the underlying collateral 
product warranty estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale 
the warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims 
the company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available 
the company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims  however  the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile 
as a result  actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the company s warranty provision and related reserves 
the company s warranty liability is discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement healthcare benefits the company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans  which cover substantially all employees of the motorcycles segment 
the company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements serpa with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the tax revenue reconciliation act of pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations 
the valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
the company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations 
based on this analysis  the discount rate for pension and serpa obligations was decreased from as of december  to as of december  the discount rate for postretirement healthcare obligations was decreased from to 
the company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation  the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants 
based on the company s assessment of this data as of december   the company increased its healthcare cost trend rate to from as of december  the company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of beginning in these assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods 
the following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions in thousands amounts based on current assumptions impact of a decrease in the discount rate impact of a increase in the healthcare cost trend rate net periodic benefit costs pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare benefit obligations pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare this information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts 
the calculation of pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here 
this information should be considered in combination with the information provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock compensation costs the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted adjusted for forfeitures 
this cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures 
as a result  changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
the company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options  including stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

table of contents the company uses a weighted average of historical and implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock 
the implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options 
in addition  the traded options have exercise prices that are both a near the money and b close to the exercise price of the employee stock options 
finally  the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year 
dividend yield was based on the company s expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option 
however  the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted  and as result  the company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted
