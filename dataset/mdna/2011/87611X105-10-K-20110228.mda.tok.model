overview targa resources partners lp is a publicly traded delaware limited partnership formed on october  by targa resources corp 
targa or parent 
our common units are listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ngls 
in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our or the partnership are intended to mean the business and operations of targa resources partners lp and its consolidated subsidiaries 
targa resources gp llc is a delaware limited liability company  formed by targa in october to own a general partner interest in us 
its primary business purpose is to manage our affairs and operations 
targa resources gp llc is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
we acquired targa s ownership interests in the following assets  liabilities and operations on the dates indicated collectively  the dropdown transactions february north texas system  october san angelo saou and louisiana lou  september downstream business  april permian business and straddle assets august versado  and september venice operations 
for periods prior to the above acquisition dates  we refer to the operations  assets and liabilities of these acquisitions as our predecessors 
our operations our business operations consist of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas and storing  fractionating  treating  transporting and selling natural gas liquids ngls and ngl products 
we report our operations in two divisions i natural gas gathering and processing  consisting of two reportable segments a field gathering and processing and b coastal gathering and processing  and ii ngl logistics and marketing consisting of two reportable segments a logistics assets and b marketing and distribution 
the financial results of our hedging activities are reported in other 
prior to the second quarter of  we reported our results under four reportable segments natural gas gathering and processing  logistics assets  ngl distribution and marketing and wholesale marketing 
the increase in our coastal gathering and processing businesses as a result of our acquisition of the permian business and straddle assets  and consideration of underlying operational and economic differences between field and coastal gathering and processing systems led to more granular analysis of the natural gas gathering and processing results 
also  we have aggregated the previously separately reported ngl distribution and marketing segment and wholesale marketing reportable segment into one reportable segment  marketing and distribution 
this combined marketing segment reflects significant operational interrelationships among the marketing and distribution activities apparent in our current business model 

table of contents the natural gas gathering and processing division includes assets used in the gathering of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting natural gas liquids and removing impurities 
the field gathering and processing segment s assets are located in north texas and the permian basin of west texas and new mexico and the coastal gathering and processing segment s assets are located in the onshore and near offshore region of the louisiana gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
the ngl logistics and marketing division is also referred to as our downstream business 
it includes all the activities necessary to convert raw natural gas liquids into ngl products  market the finished products and provide certain value added services 
the logistics assets segment transports and stores mixed ngls and fractionates  stores  and transports finished ngls 
these assets are generally connected to and supplied  in part  by our gathering and processing segments and are predominantly located in mont belvieu  texas and western louisiana 
the marketing and distribution segment covers all activities required to distribute and market raw and finished natural gas liquids and all natural gas marketing activities 
it includes marketing our own natural gas liquids production and purchasing natural gas liquids products in selected united states markets  providing liquefied petroleum gas balancing services to refinery customers  transporting  storing and selling propane and providing related propane logistics services to multi state retailers  independent retailers and other end users  and marketing natural gas available to us from our gathering and processing segments and the purchase and resale of natural gas in selected united states markets 
factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are substantially impacted by the volumes that move through both of our gathering and processing and our logistics assets  our contract terms and changes in commodity prices 
volumes 
in our gathering and processing operations  plant inlet volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production  our competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for oil  natural gas and ngls on exploration and production activity in the areas of our operations 
the factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to our downstream business 
in addition  fractionation volumes are also affected by the location of the resulting mixed ngls  available pipeline capacity to transport ngls to our fractionators  and our competitive and contractual position relative to other fractionators 
contract terms and contract mix and the impact of commodity prices 
because of the significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  the contract mix of our natural gas gathering and processing segment can have a significant impact on our profitability  especially those that create exposure to changes in energy prices 
set forth below is a table summarizing the mix of our natural gas gathering and processing contracts for and the potential impacts of commodity prices on operating margins percent of contract type throughput impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margins 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of liquids or to wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
favorable processing economics typically occur when processed ngls can be sold  after allowing for processing costs  at a higher value than natural gas on a btu equivalent basis 

table of contents we generally prefer to enter into contracts with less commodity price sensitivity including fee based and percent of proceeds arrangements 
however  negotiated contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed  and customer requirements 
our gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition  and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
the contract terms and contract mix of our downstream business can also have a significant impact on our results of operations 
during periods of low relative demand for available fractionation capacity  rates are low and take or pay contracts are not readily available 
currently  demand for fractionation services is relatively high  rates have increased  contract terms or lengths have increased and reservation fees are required 
these fractionation contracts in the logistics assets segment are primarily fee based arrangements while the marketing and distribution segment includes both fee based and percent of proceeds contracts 
impact of our commodity price hedging activities 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for these periods 
we actively manage the downstream business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing ngl prices 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
general and administrative expenses 
our omnibus agreement with targa  our general partner and others addresses the reimbursement of costs incurred on our behalf and indemnification matters 
under the omnibus agreement as amended  which runs through april  targa will provide general and administrative and other services to us associated with our existing assets and any future targa conveyances and subject to mutual agreement  our future acquisitions from third parties 
since october   after the final conveyance of assets to us by targa  substantially all of targa s general and administrative costs have been and will continue to be allocated to us  other than targa s direct costs of being a separate public reporting company 
the employees supporting our operations are employees of targa 
we reimburse targa for the payment of certain operating expenses  including compensation and benefits of operating personnel assigned to our assets  and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
targa performs centralized corporate functions for us  such as legal  accounting  treasury  insurance  risk management  health  safety and environmental  information technology  human resources  credit  payroll  internal audit  taxes  engineering and marketing 
under a amendment to the omnibus agreement  targa will provide distribution support to us in the form of reduced general and administrative expense billings  up to million per quarter  if necessary  for a times distribution coverage ratio 
the distribution support is in effect for the nine quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of no distribution support has been required through the fourth quarter of distributions to our unitholders we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner at least at the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures  as well as our working capital needs 

table of contents the following table shows the distributions we paid in and distributions paid distributions for the three limited partners general partner per limited date paid months ended common subordinated incentive total partner unit in millions  except per unit amounts november  september  august  june  may  march  february  december  november  september  august  june  may  march  february  december  on february   we paid a cash distributions of per unit on our outstanding common units 
the total distribution paid was million  with million paid to our non affiliated common unitholders and million  million and million paid to targa for its common unit ownership  general partner interest and incentive distribution rights 
under the terms of our amended and restated partnership agreement  all  subordinated units converted to common units on a one to one basis on may  general trends and outlook we expect the midstream energy business environment to continue to be affected by the following key trends demand for our services  significant relationships  commodity prices  volatile capital markets and increased regulation 
these expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
demand for our services 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase 
we believe that the current strength of oil  condensate and ngl prices as compared to natural gas prices has caused producers in and around our natural gas gathering and processing areas of operation to focus their drilling programs on regions rich in liquid forms of hydrocarbons 
this focus is reflected in increased drilling permits and higher rig counts in these areas  and we expect these activities to lead to higher inlet volumes in the field gathering and processing segment over the next several years 
while we expect demand for our ngl products to remain strong  a reduction in demand for ngl products or a significant increase in ngl product supply relative to this demand  could impact our business 
producer activity in areas rich in oil  condensate and ngls is currently generating increased demand for our fractionation services and for related fee based services provided by our downstream business 
while we expect development activity to remain robust with respect to oil and liquids rich gas development and production  currently depressed natural gas prices have resulted in reduced activity levels surrounding comparatively dry natural gas reserves  whether conventional or unconventional 

table of contents significant relationships 
the following table lists the counterparties that account for more than of our consolidated sales and consolidated product purchases year ended december  revenues chevron phillips chemical company llc purchases louis dreyfus energy services lp commodity prices 
current forward commodity prices for the january through december period show natural gas and crude oil prices strengthening while ngl prices weaken on an absolute price basis and as a percentage of crude oil 
various industry commodity price forecasts based on fundamental analysis may differ significantly from forward market prices 
both are subject to change due to multiple factors 
there has been and we believe there will continue to be significant volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among ngl  crude oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  the volatility and uncertainty of natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices impact drilling  completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to our systems 
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas  ngl and condensate prices  primarily as a result of our percent of proceeds contracts 
our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
recent weak economic conditions have negatively affected the pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which caused a reduction in profitability of our processing operations 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account our hedges  we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
volatile capital markets 
we are dependent on our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures 
global financial markets have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile and disrupted and weak economic conditions may cause a significant decline in commodity prices 
as a result  we may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms  or at all  which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we execute growth plans 
prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our ability or willingness to enter into new hedges  fund organic growth  connect to new supplies of natural gas  execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures 
increased regulation 
additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact our operations and financial condition 
for example  increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas and of ngls from producers 
please read risk factors increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that the partnership gathers  processes and fractionates 
similarly  the forthcoming rules and regulations of the cftc may limit our ability or increase the cost to use derivatives  which could create more volatility and less predictability in our results of operations 
please read risk factors the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the united states congress could have an adverse effect on the partnership s ability to hedge risks associated with its business 
how we evaluate our operations our profitability is a function of the difference between the revenues we receive from our operations  including revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate we sell  and the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas and mixed ngls that we purchase as well as operating and general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
our contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls  and the volumes of natural gas and ngl throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability 
our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  supply and demand for our products and services and changes in our customer mix 

table of contents our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  operating expenses and the following non gaap measures gross margin  operating margin  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production as well as by capturing natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties 
similarly  our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed ngl supply  typically connected by third party transportation  to our downstream fractionation facilities 
we fractionate ngls generated by our gathering and processing plants as well as by contracting for mixed ngl supply from third party gathering or fractionation facilities 
in addition  we seek to increase operating margins by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with our gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  we monitor the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants 
we also monitor the volumes of ngls received  stored  fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets 
this information is tracked through our processing plants and downstream facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations  we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
similar tracking is performed for our logistics assets 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
labor  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses generally remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
gross margin 
gross margin is defined as revenues less purchases 
it is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and hedging program 
we define natural gas gathering and processing gross margin as total operating revenues from the sales of natural gas and ngl plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases 
logistics assets gross margin consists primarily of service fee revenue 
gross margin for marketing and distribution equals total revenue from service fees and ngl sales  less cost of sales  which consists primarily of ngl purchases  transportation costs and changes in inventory valuation 
the gross margin impacts of cash flow hedge settlements are reported in other 
operating margin 
operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we define operating margin as gross margin less operating expenses 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 
gross margin and operating margin are non gaap measures 
the generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure most directly comparable to gross margin and operating margin is net income 
gross margin and operating margin are not alternatives to gaap net income  and have important limitations as analytical tools 
you should not consider gross margin and operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because gross margin and operating margin exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and are defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of gross margin and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing their utility 

table of contents targa senior management reviews business segment gross margin and operating margin monthly as a core internal management process 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
gross margin and operating margin provide useful information to investors because they are used as supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others 
the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors

table of contents distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp plus depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes and amortization of debt issue costs included in interest expense  adjusted for losses gains on mark to market derivative contracts and debt repurchases  less maintenance capital expenditures net of any reimbursements of project costs 
the impact of noncontrolling interests is included in our measure 
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to make distributions to our investors

the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
we have hedged the commodity price associated with a significant portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes by entering into derivative financial instruments 
our hedging strategy is in effect to forward sell our equity gas and ngl volumes generated by our gas plants 
as such  these hedge positions will enhance our margins in periods of falling prices and decrease our margins in periods of rising prices 
on april  and august  the dropdown dates  commodity derivative contracts were re assigned to us as part of the conveyance of assets from targa 
as a result  we recast our financial statements as if these derivative contracts had always been assigned to us in accordance with common control accounting 
on the dropdown dates  we designated the respective derivative contracts as hedges  and  as such  they receive hedge accounting treatment from their respective dropdown dates forward 
prior to the dropdown dates  under common control accounting  the respective commodity derivatives were not designated as hedges  and therefore receive mark to market accounting  which is recorded as a component of other income loss

we did not have income from business interruption insurance during year ended december  in millions coastal gathering and processing logistics assets marketing and distribution liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance our operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet our indebtedness obligations  to refinance our indebtedness or to meet our collateral requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including weather  commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  and our ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  the issuance of additional units by the partnership and access to debt markets 
the capital markets continue to experience volatility 
many financial institutions have had liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
our exposure to current credit conditions includes our credit facility  cash investments and counterparty performance risks 
continued volatility in the debt markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
we continue to evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit 
we have all of our commodity derivatives with major financial institutions or major oil companies 
should any of these financial counterparties not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
we sell our natural gas  ngls and condensate to a variety of purchasers 
non performance by a trade creditor could result in losses 
crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for this period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
the current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts 
a significant reduction in commodity prices could reduce our operating margins and cash flow from operations 

table of contents as of december  our liquidity of million consisted of million of available cash  and million of available borrowings under our credit facility 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
additionally  we continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders in our credit facility 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that replaced our existing variable rate senior secured credit facility with a new variable rate senior secured credit facility due july the new senior secured credit facility increased available commitments to billion  and allows us to request increases in commitments up to an additional million 
the amended and restated credit agreement increased our availability by million 
our cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance our operating expenditures and non acquisition related capital expenditures 
based on our anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  we believe that internally generated cash flow and borrowings available under our senior secured credit facility should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  long term indebtedness obligations  collateral requirements and minimum quarterly cash distribution for at least the next twelve months 
a significant portion of our capital resources are utilized in the form of cash and letters of credit to satisfy counterparty collateral demands 
these counterparty collateral demands reflect our non investment grade status  as determined by moody s investors service  inc and standard and poor s rating service  and counterparties views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations  as well as commodity prices and other factors 
at december   our total outstanding letter of credit postings were million 
we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner at least at the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
as of december   such annual minimum amounts payable to non targa unitholders approximate million 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures

working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell 
in general  our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices 
however  our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices 
in addition  the timing of payments received by our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger suppliers and customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month 
we expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors 
we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 
as of december   we had a positive working capital balance of million

capital requirements the midstream energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to our gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  we expect to make significant expenditures during the next year for the construction of additional natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure and to enhance the value of our natural gas logistics and marketing assets 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  add capabilities  reduce costs or enhance revenues

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates 
property  plant and equipment 
in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the period it benefits 
our property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets 
at the time we place our assets in service  we believe such assumptions are reasonable  however  circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions  which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively 
examples of such circumstances include changes in energy prices  changes in competition  changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset  changes in technology that render an asset obsolete  changes in expected salvage values  and changes in the forecast life of applicable resources basins  if any 
as of december   the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and we recorded million in depreciation expense for the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result 
for example  if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that depreciation expense would increase by million per year  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
in addition  if an assessment of impairment resulted in a reduction of of our long lived assets  our operating income would decrease by million in the year of impairment 
there have been no material changes impacting estimated useful lives of the assets 
revenue recognition 
as of december   our balance sheet reflects total accounts receivable from third parties of million 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  of million 
our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable relates to the financial health of its counterparties 
we have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if an assessment of uncollectibility resulted in a reduction of our third party accounts receivable  our operating income would decrease by million in the year of assessment 
price risk management hedging 
our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we have entered into i derivative financial instruments related to a portion of our equity volumes to manage the purchase and sales prices of commodities and ii interest rate financial instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable debt 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in these derivative financial instruments 
we also monitor ngl inventory levels with a view to mitigating losses related to downward price exposure 
our cash flow is affected by the derivative financial instruments we enter into to the extent these instruments are settled by i making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty or ii making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative financial instrument 
typically a derivative financial instrument is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions we use to value our derivative financial instruments  which are reflected at their fair values in the balance sheet 
the relationship between the derivative financial instruments and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the derivative financial instrument and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a derivative financial instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative financial instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
the estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments was a net liability of million as of december   net of an adjustment for credit risk 
the credit risk adjustment is based on the default probabilities by year for each counterparty s traded credit default swap transactions 
these default probabilities have been applied to the unadjusted fair values of the derivative financial instruments to arrive at the credit risk adjustment  which aggregates to less than million as of december  we and our indirect parent  targa  have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if a financial instrument counterparty were to declare bankruptcy  we would be exposed to the loss of fair value of the financial instrument transaction with that counterparty 
ignoring our adjustment for credit risk  if a bankruptcy by financial instrument counterparty impacted of the fair value of commodity based financial instruments  we estimate that our operating income would decrease by million in the year of bankruptcy

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by our customers 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of our revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls or equity volumes  as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  as of december   we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes that result from our percent of proceeds processing arrangements for our field gathering and processing  operations through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of our expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngl and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes  we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
we utilize purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
we intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar hedge transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other hedge instruments as market conditions permit 
we have tailored our hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of its physical equity volumes 
our ngl hedges cover specific ngl products based upon our expected equity ngl composition 
we believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
our ngl hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu through  except for the price of isobutane in  which is based on the ending pricing 
our natural gas hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at waha  permian basin and mid continent  which closely approximate the actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
we hedge a portion of our condensate sales using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
these commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association form with customized credit and legal terms 
our principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
our payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges  are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we expect to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time  even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not create credit exposure to us for our counterparties 
for all periods presented we entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of our forecasted equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors 
during  and  our operating revenues were increased decreased by net hedge adjustments of million  million and million 

table of contents as of december   our commodity derivative arrangements were as follows natural gas instrument price mmbtu per day type index mmbtu fair value in millions swap if waha swap if waha swap if waha total swaps swap if pb swap if pb swap if pb total swaps swap if ngpl mc swap if ngpl mc total swaps natural gas basis swaps basis swaps various indexes  maturities january may ngl instrument price barrels per day type index gal fair value in millions swap opis mb swap opis mb swap opis mb total swaps floor opis mb floor opis mb total floors total sales condensate instrument price barrels per day type index bbl fair value in millions swap ny wti swap ny wti swap ny wti swap ny wti total sales these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which we have hedged  we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
we account for the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore required an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we determine the value of our ngl derivative contracts utilizing a discounted cash flow model for swaps and a standard option pricing model for options  based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets or are quoted by counterparties to these contracts 
prior to  all of our ngl contracts were classified as level within the hierarchy 
in  we were able to obtain inputs from quoted prices related to certain of these commodity derivatives for similar assets and liabilities in active markets 
these inputs are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for the full term of the commodity swaps and options 
for the ngl contracts that have inputs from quoted prices  we have changed our classification of these instruments from level to level within the fair value hierarchy 
for those ngl contracts where we were unable to obtain quoted prices for the full term of the commodity swap and options the ngl valuations are still classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
to the extent that interest rates increase  interest expense for our revolving debt will also increase 
as of december   we had variable rate borrowings of million outstanding 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have entered into several interest rate swap and interest rate basis swap agreements
