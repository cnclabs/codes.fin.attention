our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new technologies and products  and complemented by our ability to implement our selective acquisitions strategy 
new technologies or products that we may develop may not lead to an incremental increase in revenues  and there is a risk that these new technologies or products will decrease the demand for our existing products and result in an offsetting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that the benefits of any acquisition will outweigh the attendant costs  and if they do not  our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected 
in october  we completed the acquisition of zarlink semiconductor inc  an international semiconductor supplier that designs  manufactures and distributes microelectronic components for the communications and medical industries 
we expect that zarlink s timing  synchronization and voice products  which complement our existing communications products  will significantly add to our consolidated net sales in however  uncertain macroeconomic conditions worldwide and the devastating flooding and ongoing impacts in thailand  which shut down our operations at two subcontracted facilities  subject us to certain risks see part ii  item a  risk factors  negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations and the concentration of the facilities that service the semiconductor industry  including facilities of current or potential vendors or customers  makes us more susceptible to events or disasters affecting the areas in which they are most concentrated 
net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for with increases in each of our reported end markets

table of contents restructuring and severance charges in  we approved consolidation plans that resulted in the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona scottsdale  which ceased production during the quarter ended april  the scottsdale facility occupied a  square foot leased facility 
employee severance is expected to be paid through facility termination costs relate primarily to remaining obligations under facility and equipment leases and are expected to be paid through the following table reflects the restructuring activities for the scottsdale facility and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance facility termination costs total balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at october  at october   we had recorded severance accruals of million from reductions in force at our various facilities other than scottsdale 
we recorded additional provisions  primarily related to activities at microsemi soc  for severance and retention payments totaling million in severance covered approximately individuals in manufacturing  engineering and sales 
substantially all accrued amounts are expected to be paid within twelve months 
the following table reflects the restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance balance at october  provisions cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at october  critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
additional information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained in note of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amount shown in the balance sheet are trade accounts receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based in part on our historical write off experience and specific review of account balances due 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
to date  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been within management s estimates 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
additionally  inventory write downs are made based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
to date  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities accounting standards codification asc permits entities to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
for financial assets or financial liabilities for which an entity elects the fair value option  asc requires that the entity record the financial asset or financial liability at fair value rather than at historical cost with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement 
asc requires that upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
we have elected the fair value option on our credit facility that we entered into in long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition including manufacturing plant closures 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets within the asset group over their fair value is recorded 
the appropriate asset group is determined based on the lowest level of largely independent cash inflows and outflows for the related assets 
depending on the nature of the primary assets in the asset group  fair value is estimated using one of several approaches including replacement cost  appraised values  market quotes or estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and a held and used impairment of million for the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill on an impairment only approach and amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings 
we operate as one reporting unit and an impairment charge would equal the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in our one reporting unit over its then fair value 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we perform our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we primarily recognize revenue from customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors  and these contracts may permit limited stock rotation returns 
we provide an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenue have been within management s expectations 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts 
revenue for these contracts are recorded under a percentage of completion method  which is based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion 
gross profit expected to be realized on fixed price contracts are based on periodic estimates of total revenues and costs for each contract 
losses on contracts are accrued when estimated total costs exceed total revenues 
occasionally  we will enter into contracts on a cost plus fee basis 
we recognize revenue based on reimbursements for actual expenses plus the contractually agreed upon fee with the customer 
restructuring charges we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded and can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability is recorded 
the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions and elimination of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability exists  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their expected termination dates and expected severance payments or when formal severance plans exist  when the severance payments are probable and reasonably estimable 
the elimination of excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated sublease income  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from the facilities 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises or ceased use of the facility 

table of contents stock based compensation compensation expense for stock options was calculated based on the date of grant or conversion using the black scholes option pricing model with exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards were granted to employees with compensation expense determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options and restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if length of service requirements are unmet 
expected life was estimated based on historical exercise data that was stratified between members of the board of directors  executive employees and all other recipients 
expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility using equally weighted daily price observations over a period approximately equal to the expected life of each option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury securities with an equivalent remaining term 
no dividends are expected to be paid 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions when they meet a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we file us federal  state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
fiscal years to generally remain subject examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the to tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
we establish liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to  international tax issues and certain tax credits 
we do not believe the results of any audits would have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
segment information we use the management approach for segment disclosure  which designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we manage our business on the basis of one reportable segment  as a manufacturer of semiconductors in different geographic areas  including the united states  europe and asia 

table of contents results of operations net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for sales in each end market were favorably impacted both in and by contributions from products we added from recent acquisitions 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for the last three fiscal years is approximately as follows amounts in thousands defense security aerospace enterprise communications industrial alternative energy total net sales in the defense security end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
sales in this end market were favorably impacted by contributions from the ramping of millimeter wave scan subsystems used in whole body scanners  missile defense and in military rf applications 
over the near term  we believe the department of defense and homeland security budgets for electronic content  an area of microsemi focus  will continue to expand and contribute to growth in this end market 
we also believe that international defense sales will increase  enabled in part by our security product offerings  and that microsemi s dollar content in defense programs will increase as our products move up the value chain 
however  we recognize that the current us federal budget situation will result in short term delays in defense programs and potentially defer growth beyond the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the aerospace end market increased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
after a period where this end market was negatively impacted by global economic conditions  net sales between and increased and was driven by demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  growing electronic content in current aircraft  refurbishment programs for older aircraft and demand for the high reliability radar and avionics solutions we provide 
sales into satellite applications have grown as we have increased our product portfolio  especially system level products  power management ics and dc dc converter solutions 
generally space related applications are in a less economically sensitive market though we currently expect a moderation of growth 
combined with expected growth from commercial air applications  we expect that this end market will grow in the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the enterprise communications end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
net sales in recovered from  a period that was negatively impacted as enterprise demand waned in a challenging economic environment and demand for parts used in automotive navigation systems and notebook storage products declined 
this recovery continued in as we experienced steady sales of our poe offerings  rf power amplifier and dc dc products 
we believe that rapid market adoption of poe technology  especially by enterprise customers  has increased our market share and our wireless lan products are well accepted 
we expect additional contribution from our display products such as led drivers for solid state lighting and television backlighting 
while this end market is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions  based on current and expected backlog  we expect that net sales from products prior to the acquisition of zarlink will grow in the upcoming quarter 
we also expect significant contribution from zarlink  as approximately of its net sales are expected to be in this end market 

table of contents net sales in the industrial alternative energy end market increased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
the increases in were driven by growth in products for semiconductor capital equipment  an area which experienced substantial declines in and part of due to decreased capital spending during the recent economic downturn 
we have also noted growth in plasma cutting and welding applications where our high power proficiency differentiates our products and also contributions from microsemi soc 
the declines in were due to products in medical applications that were impacted by lower procurement levels of icd products that were in line with moderating growth in the icd space 
sales into medical applications in also benefited from our support of a product launch schedule of a principal icd customer 
declines in this end market in were partially offset by growth in products for semiconductor capital equipment 
we expect cyclicality in the semiconductor capital equipment  as well as well as a slowdown in products solar applications will adversely impact this end market 
in addition  due to the impact of flooding at our subcontractor s facilities in thailand  we expect that sales in this end market will decline in the upcoming quarter 
we do expect contribution from zarlink in this end market as approximately of its net sales are expected to be in this end market 
an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for  and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total gross profit increased million between and  to million of sales for from million of sales for and increased million between and  from million of sales for gross profit percentage for was favorably impacted by higher margin products related to microsemi soc  cost optimization programs  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities including the closure of our scottsdale facility and reductions in personnel 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of bridging inventory that we intended to complete at other locations and million for the write off of medical inventory that did not meet our corporate gross margin targets 
we also recorded a charge in the second quarter of of million for scottsdale remediation and fixed assets that we abandoned as part of our scottsdale facility closure 
in addition  we recorded non cash purchase accounting expenses of million in related to manufacturing profit in acquired inventory 
gross profit percentage for was favorably impacted by cost optimization programs  which included the closure of our facility in colorado  ramp down of our scottsdale facility  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities and reductions in personnel 
in  gross profit percentage was impacted basis points from inventory write downs related to product lines that do not meet gross margin targets  products that are being migrated to newer generations  products that service large capital spending end markets for which demand has declined and inventory at our scottsdale facility that we announced we are closing 
the remaining decline in gross profit percentage in was due substantially to the effects of fixed costs allocated over lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million between and to million for from million for and increased million between and from million in while selling  general and administrative expenses in were favorably impacted by restructuring and cost control measures  these expenses increased overall primarily due to the incremental costs incurred from acquisitions we added over the last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were favorably impacted from restructuring and cost control measures 
selling  general and administrative expense in and also included acquisition related costs such as investment advisor  transaction and legal fees of 
table of contents million and million  respectively  while in  these costs were allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired in accordance with gaap then in effect 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase next quarter  related to incremental costs from zarlink  offset by cost controls we have implemented in response to the current economic environment 
research and development expense increased million between and to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in the increase in was due to additional product development to support our organic growth and attributable to additional research and development activities from acquisitions 
the increase between and was due to higher purchases of materials  masks and other supplies related to new product development for both high reliability and analog mixed signal products  as well as additional spending related to acquisitions 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
we expect research and development expense to increase next quarter related to incremental costs from zarlink and to support our product development efforts as we intend to continue to make product investments that deliver continued organic growth 
amortization of intangible assets increased million between and to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in the increases reflect additional amortization expense related to identifiable intangibles resulting from acquisitions consummated in and restructuring charges amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the restructuring charges included million related to our scottsdale facility lease termination costs accrued at the cease use date and million in charges for severance and termination benefits  primarily at facilities that we acquired in or at locations where we integrated recent acquisitions  principally actel 
restructuring charges in related to costs incurred to optimize our personnel levels 
restructuring charges in consisted of million in severance and million in other related costs and included amounts from the closure of our scottsdale manufacturing facility 
operating income decreased million to million in from million in the favorable impact of higher sales were offset by million higher amortization of acquired intangibles  million higher restructuring costs related to severance expenses and the closure of our scottsdale facility  and incremental costs from our acquisitions 
impairment charges in related to facility closures represented the held for sale impairment for the building and real estate related to our closed broomfield  colorado facility amounting to million and the held and used impairment for our scottsdale manufacturing facility amounting to million to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in was related to term loan borrowings under our credit agreement 

table of contents other income expense  net  was million in compared to million in and million in we elected the fair value option in accounting for the term loan balance outstanding under our credit agreement and changes in fair value of the loan balances are reflected as adjustments to the income statement 
in connection with the credit agreement  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the acquisition of zarlink  we entered into a foreign currency forward agreement in the fourth quarter of to minimize our foreign currency risk associated with the transaction that we funded in canadian dollars cad 
we reflect the change in fair value of our term loan balances  swaps and forward contract through other income or expense 
we recorded expense of million related to these adjustments 
in addition  upon election of the fair value option  we were required to immediately expense up front debt issuance and refinancing costs that totaled million in finally  in we recorded a gain of million related to the sale of a facility 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on pretax income of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million on pre tax income of million in the benefit for income taxes of million included the release of million of the remaining valuation allowance related to our israel operation s deferred tax assets  release of million of our us valuation allowance and recognition of million in current year tax benefits from net operating losses and tax credits as a result of the excess deferred tax liabilities resulting from our acquisitions of actel corporation  aml corporation  and asic advantage  inc these benefits were partially offset by foreign tax expense of million 
we had cumulative operating losses for our us operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain us deferred tax assets would not be realized 
key positive and negative evidence we considered in making this determination included recent history of cumulative operating losses for our us operations  future estimates of operating results for our us operations  and our ability to carry back our us operating losses  tax credits and reversing temporary differences to recover previously paid taxes 
based on this assessment  we determined that a valuation allowance was required for the deferred tax assets related to our us operations that could not be carried back due to lower availability of previously paid taxes 
accordingly  we recorded a million valuation allowance on a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets  which was included in the total tax provision of million for fiscal year during fiscal year we released the remaining valuation allowance related to our israel operation based on an evaluation of key positive and negative evidence including the history of substantial losses in past years but cumulative income for the past three year period  and the indefinite carryforward period for the israeli net operating loss carryforwards which are the principal component of our deferred tax assets in israel

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in credit risk  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates or the stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  which are related to credit risks  changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and changes in certain interest rates 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed 
table of contents to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
specific to the acquisition of zarlink  as further discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we entered into foreign currency forward agreement in the fourth quarter of to minimize our foreign currency risk associated with the transaction that we funded in canadian dollars 
we agreed to purchase cad million for million for settlement in october other than the foregoing  we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have considered and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consisting principally of trade accounts receivable 
concentrations of credit risk exist because we rely on a significant portion of customers whose principal sales are to the us government 
approximately of total net sales in were in the defense security end market  with a very significant amount to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we  as a subcontractor  sell our products to higher tier subcontractors or to prime contractors based upon purchase orders that usually do not contain all of the conditions included in the prime contract with the us government 
however these sales are usually subject to termination and or price renegotiations by virtue of their reference to a us government prime contract 
therefore  we believe that all of our product sales that ultimately are sold to the us government may be subject to termination  at the convenience of the us government or to price renegotiations under the renegotiation act 
we have never experienced a material loss due to termination of a u 
s government contract 
we have never had to renegotiate our price under any government contract 
at the end of fiscal year  interest under the facilities is  at our option  base rate or libor  plus a margin ranging from to for base rate based loans that are either term loans or revolving loans and ranging from to for libor based loans that are either term loans or revolving loans  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the base rate for term loans is equal to per annum and for revolving loans is a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the highest of a the prime rate  b of per annum above the federal funds effective rate and c one month libor plus 
interest for base rate based loans is calculated on the basis of a day year and interest for libor based loans is calculated on the basis of a day year 
the current principal amount outstanding under our term loan facility is a libor based loan and is subject to an interest rate of 
a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility would increase interest expense by approximately million annually 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we amended our credit agreement and increased the term loan balance to million which was subject to an interest rate of 
we also borrowed million under the revolving facility 
a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility and revolving facility would increase interest expense by approximately million annually 
in connection with the credit agreement  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
the cash flows received under the interest rate swap agreements are expected to offset the change in cash flows associated with libor rate borrowings between the effective and maturity dates of the swaps 
our three swap agreements have notional amounts  fixed rates and terms as follows million at for two years  million at for three years and million at for four years 
we reflect the change in value of the swaps through other income or expense and at october   recorded a liability of million 
we recorded the related expense in other income expense  net 
we classify interest rate swap balances as level fair value measurements 
we determined the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements based on mid market valuations reported to us by rj capital services  inc  the counterparty to the swap agreements
