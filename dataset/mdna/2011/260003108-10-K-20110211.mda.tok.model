valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the 
table of contents company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  then revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete 
in addition  when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement  the company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed 
revenues associated with construction type contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method 
the company recognizes contract revenue under percentage of completion accounting using the cost to cost method measure of progress 
the application of percentage of completion accounting requires estimates of future revenues and contract costs over the full term of the contract 
the company updates project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or more frequently when changes in circumstances warrant 
inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
the electronic technologies companies tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation  in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though the company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
the company has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
the company s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or  when indicators of impairment exist  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  during the interim periods 
the company estimates fair value using discounted cash flow analyses ie an income approach which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability 
changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
no goodwill impairment was indicated by the company s testing of its identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of  and the fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying values 
if the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by  the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized 
the valuation of the company s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for the company s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on the company s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
the company s discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams 
the plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year by year 
table of contents spot rates 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s weighted average discount rates used to measure its qualified defined benefit  supplemental and other post retirement obligations were  and  respectively  in each case reduced from the rates of  and  respectively 
the reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interests over these periods 
a basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december  the company s pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on assets would have increased the company s defined benefit pension expense by approximately million 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated  using more likely than not criteria  for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and the company s future taxable income levels 
the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its provision for income taxes 
the company has significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  the company s experience and relevant industry data 
the company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
the company has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates is required to quantify the company s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to ensure that the company is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while the company believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar type entities 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
the company is required to recognize in its consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock and performance share awards 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its sars  and stock options that are granted to employees 
the model requires management to estimate the expected life of the sar or option  expected forfeitures and the volatility of the company s stock using historical data 
the company uses the monte carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also requires management 
table of contents to estimate the volatility of its stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of its peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group

new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu which is intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires entities to disclose significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels  the reasons for the transfers and to present information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
additionally  the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using significant other observable inputs level and significant unobservable inputs level 
the company has applied the new disclosure requirements as of january   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level reconciliation  which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu which amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist  and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables 
the guidance is expected to result in more multiple deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance 
this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january  and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements 
its adoption is not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non software components that operate together to deliver a product s functionality from the scope of current generally accepted accounting principles for software 
this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january  and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements 
its adoption is not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
non gaap disclosures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses non gaap information which management believes provides useful information to investors 
free cash flow  net debt  the net debt to net capitalization ratio  total debt  total capitalization  adjusted working capital  average annual adjusted working capital  revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities  debt or equity  revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with gaap  and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity 
net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating the company s capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs 
free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase the company s common stock 
reconciliations of free cash flow  total debt and net debt can be found above in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management believes that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital  which is calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue 
management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency  which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational changes  given the global nature of dover s businesses 
management believes that reporting organic revenue growth  which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions  provides a useful comparison of the company s revenue performance and trends between periods 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the diverse nature of the company s business activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks  including those related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the company s policy is to contract with highly rated  diversified counterparties 
interest rate exposure the company may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   the company did not have any open interest rate swap contracts 
the company issues commercial paper  which exposes it to changes in variable interest rates  however  maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
the company considers its current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since its debt is largely long term and fixed rate in nature 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of company s long term debt by approximately million 
however  since the company has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturities  the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company s long term debt does not affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
foreign currency exposure the company conducts business in various non us countries  primarily in canada  mexico  substantially all of the european countries  brazil  argentina  malaysia  china  india and other asian countries 
therefore  the company has a significant volume of foreign currency exposures that result from its international sales  purchases  investments  borrowings and other international transactions 
changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in non us operations 
the company may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges 
at december   the company had one outstanding floating to floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of million in exchange for chf million  which matures on february  this transaction hedges a portion of the company s net investment in non us operations 
the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income  with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings 
the fair values at december  reflected losses of million and million  due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 
certain individual operating companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and or cash flow hedging programs 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of non us operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change of or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the translation of the company s balance sheet or statement of operations
