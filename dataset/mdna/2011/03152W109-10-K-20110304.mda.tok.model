item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview amicus therapeutics  inc amicus is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of orally administered  small molecule drugs known as pharmacological chaperones for the treatment of rare diseases 
pharmacological chaperones are a novel  first in class approach to treating a broad range of diseases including lysosomal storage disorders and diseases of neurodegeneration 
we believe that our pharmacological chaperone technology  our advanced product pipeline  especially our lead product candidate  amigal  and our strategic collaboration with glaxosmithkline uniquely position us as a leader in the development of treatments for rare diseases 
our current areas of focus include the following the phase development of our lead product candidate  amigal for fabry disease  the preclinical and clinical development of pharmacological chaperones co administered with enzyme replacement therapy  and the preclinical evaluation of the use of pharmacological chaperones for diseases of neurodegeneration 
our novel approach to the treatment of human genetic diseases consists of using pharmacological chaperones that selectively bind to the target protein  increasing the stability of the protein and helping it fold into the correct three dimensional shape 
this allows proper trafficking of the protein within the cell  thereby increasing protein activity  improving cellular function and potentially reducing cell stress 
we have also demonstrated in preclinical studies that pharmacological chaperones can further stabilize normal  or wild type proteins 
this stabilization could lead to a higher percentage of the target proteins folding correctly and more stably  which can increase cellular levels of that target protein and improve cellular function  making chaperones potentially applicable to a wide range of diseases 
our lead product candidate  amigal migalastat hydrochloride for fabry disease  is in phase development 
we are developing and commercializing amigal with an affiliate of glaxosmithkline plc gsk pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement entered into in october our partnership with gsk allows us to utilize gsk s significant expertise in clinical  regulatory  commercial and manufacturing matters in the development in amigal 
in addition  the cost sharing arrangements and potential milestone and royalty payments under the license and collaboration agreement provide us with financial strength and allow us to continue the development of amigal while also advancing our other programs 
we also believe this collaboration is important in validating our status as a leader in the development of treatments for rare diseases given the increasing focus placed on the rare disease field 
our phase clinical development program for the use of amigal as monotherapy in fabry disease includes two clinical trials study and study we have enrolled a majority of the planned patients for study  and intend to commence an additional phase study study in the first half of we plan to use the data from study to support the filing of a new drug application  or nda  for marketing approval in the united states and the data from study to support the filing of an application for marketing authorization in europe 
while our initial clinical efforts have focused on the use of pharmacological chaperones to treat lysosomal storage diseases  we believe that our technology may be applicable to the treatment of certain diseases of neurodegeneration 
our lead preclinical program in this area is focused on parkinson s disease  where we expect to complete late stage preclinical proof of concept studies  including ind enabling activities  for our pharmacological chaperone molecule at during our second preclinical program in this area is focused on alzheimer s disease 
our preclinical work in both parkinson s and alzheimer s disease is presently focused on genetically defined subpopulations of parkinson s and alzheimer s patients and leverages our expertise and knowledge in the rare disease field 
we have generated significant losses to date and expect to continue to generate losses as we continue the clinical development of our drug candidates  including amigal  and conduct preclinical studies on other programs 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
from our inception in february through december   we have accumulated a deficit of million 
as we have not yet generated commercial sales revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue and are likely to be substantial over at least the next couple of years 
in june  we completed our initial public offering ipo of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a select group of institutional investors 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable any time on or after the six month anniversary of the date they were issued  at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 

table of contents collaboration with gsk on october   the company entered into the license and collaboration agreement with glaxo group limited  an affiliate of gsk  to develop and commercialize amigal 
under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement  gsk received an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize amigal 
in consideration of the license grant  the company received an upfront  license payment of million from gsk and is eligible to receive further payments of approximately million upon the successful achievement of development and commercialization milestones  as well as tiered double digit royalties on global sales of amigal 
gsk and the company will jointly fund development costs in accordance with an agreed upon development plan 
this plan provides that the company will fund of the development costs for and of the development costs in and beyond 
the company s development costs are subject to annual and aggregate caps 
additionally  gsk purchased approximately million shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the total value of this equity investment to the company is approximately million and represents a ownership position in the company 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  while we will collaborate with gsk  gsk will have decision making authority over clinical  regulatory and commercial matters related to amigal 
additionally  gsk will have primary responsibility for interactions with regulatory agencies and prosecuting applications for marketing and reimbursement approvals worldwide 
financial operations overview revenue in november  gsk paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million and a premium of million related to gsk s purchase of an equity investment in amicus 
the total upfront consideration received of million will be recognized as collaboration revenue on a straight line basis over the development period of the collaboration agreement which is approximately years 
at december   we recognized approximately million of the total upfront consideration as collaboration revenue 
research and development expenses we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses as we continue to develop our product candidates and explore new uses for our pharmacological chaperone technology 
however  we will share future research and development costs related to amigal with gsk in accordance with the license and collaboration agreement 
internal costs associated with our research and clinical development activities  payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  technology license costs  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in drug discovery and development  activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
we have multiple research and development projects ongoing at any one time 
we utilize our internal resources  employees and infrastructure across multiple projects 
we record and maintain information regarding external  out of pocket research and development expenses on a project specific basis 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates 
from our inception in february through december   we have incurred research and development expense in the aggregate of million 

table of contents the following table summarizes our principal product development projects through december   including the related stages of development for each project  and the out of pocket  third party expenses incurred with respect to each project in thousands 
period from february  inception to years ended december  december  projects third party direct project expenses amigal fabry disease phase plicera gaucher disease phase at pompe disease phase neurodegenerative diseases total third party direct project expenses other project costs personnel costs other costs total other project costs total research and development costs other project costs are leveraged across multiple projects 
other costs include facility  supply  overhead  and licensing costs that support multiple projects 
we do not plan to advance plicera into phase development at this time 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates 
as a result  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates  including amigal or any of our other preclinical product candidates 
this uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the conduct  duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of evolving events during clinical development  including the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the results of our clinical trials  and any mandate by the us food and drug administration fda or other regulatory authority to conduct clinical trials beyond those currently anticipated 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others 
in addition  gsk has considerable influence over and decision making authority related to our amigal program 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
drug development may take several years and millions of dollars in development costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services  including patent related expense and accounting services 
from our inception in february through december   we spent million on general and administrative expense 

table of contents interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our capital lease facility and our equipment financing agreement 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion represents our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured 
in multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting and each deliverable in an arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there is no general right of return for the delivered elements 
in instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit of accounting 
allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit s relative selling price 
in instances where there is determined to be a single unit of accounting  the total consideration is applied as revenue for the single unit of accounting and is recognized over the period of inception through the date where the last deliverable within the single unit of accounting is expected to be delivered 
our current revenue recognition policies  which were applied in fiscal  provide that  when a collaboration arrangement contains multiple deliverables  such as license and research and development services  we allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on i its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  ii third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or iii estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we would establish the vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
the tpe of selling price would be established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
the best estimate of selling price would be established considering internal factors such as an internal pricing analysis or an income approach using a discounted cash flow model 
the revenue associated with reimbursements for research and development costs under collaboration agreements is included in research revenue and the costs associated with these reimbursable amounts are included in research and development expenses 
we record these reimbursements as revenue and not as a reduction of research and development expenses as we have not commenced our planned principal operations ie  selling commercial products and we are a development stage enterprise  therefore development activities are part of our ongoing central operations 
our collaboration agreement with gsk provides for  and any future collaboration agreements we may enter into also may provide for contingent milestone payments 
in order to determine the revenue recognition for these contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition at the inception of a collaboration agreement 
the criteria requires that i we determine if the milestone is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved 

table of contents accrued expenses when we are required to estimate accrued expenses because we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost  we identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees owed to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees owed to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees owed to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  fees owed for professional services  and unpaid salaries  wages and benefits 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation  which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of the award 
we chose the straight line attribution method for allocating compensation costs and recognized the fair value of each stock option on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million  and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes information related to stock compensation expense recognized in the income statement in millions years ended december  stock compensation expense recognized in research and development expense general and administrative expense total stock compensation expense we use the black scholes option pricing model when estimating the value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of our stock and the weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use a blended weighted average approach using our own historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury  zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows years ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options years expected annual dividend per share the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during  and were  and  respectively 
warrants we allocated million of proceeds from our march registered direct offering to warrants issued in connection with the offering that was classified as a liability and is subject to fair value mark to market adjustment each period 
the valuation of the warrants is determined using the black scholes model using inputs such as the underlying price of the shares issued when the warrant is exercised  volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the instrument 
the fair value of the warrants at december  was determined by using the black scholes model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life of years which is equal to the contractual life of the warrants 
as a result  for the year ended december   we recorded a change in warrant liability expense of million 
the resulting fair value of the warrant liability at december  was million 

table of contents basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share as a measurement of the company s performance while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
therefore  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share in thousands except share amounts years ended december  historical numerator net loss attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of common stock options for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods because of their anti dilutive effect 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing a decrease of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs of million associated with the work force reduction  a million decrease in contract manufacturing costs due to the timing of batch production and a million decrease in contract research related to clinical trials 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs of million associated with the work force reduction and a decrease in legal and professional fees of million 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in due to the corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of the restructuring charges included million for employment termination costs payable in cash and a facilities consolidation restructuring charge of million  consisting of lease payments of million related to the net present value of the net future minimum lease payments at the cease use date and the write down of the net book value of fixed assets in the vacated building of million 
there were no restructuring costs in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in both and there was no increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to less property  plant and equipment purchased in as compared to prior years 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances throughout the year 
interest expense was million in both and change in fair value of warrant liability 
in connection with the sale of our common stock and warrants from the registered direct offering in march  we recorded the warrants as a liability at their fair value using a black scholes model and will remeasure them at each reporting date until exercised or expired 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in the statements of operations as non operating income or expense 
for the year ended december   we reported a loss of million related to the increase in fair value of these warrants from issuance dates 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of these warrants 

table of contents other income expense 
other income increased due to funds received from the us treasury department in of million for the qualified therapeutic discovery projects tax credit and grant program 
other expense increased during the year due to certain items from property and equipment being disposed of during the year resulting in a charge of million 
tax benefit 
during  we sold a portion of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards  which resulted in the recognition of million in income tax benefits 
assuming the state of new jersey continues to fund this program  which is uncertain  the future amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carry forwards which we may sell will also depend upon the allocation among qualifying companies of an annual pool established by the state of new jersey 
net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   the company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal carry forward will begin to expire in and will end in the state carry forwards acquired prior to  will begin to expire in and will end in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  contains provisions which limit the amount of nols that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
we completed a detailed study of our nols and determined that as a result of our registered direct offering in march  there was an ownership change in excess of and the federal nols subject to the limitations were written down to their net realizable value 
additionally  we determined that the annual limitation on the utilization of the pre ownership change loss will be approximately million 
ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth prior to the work force reduction  a million increase in contract manufacturing costs due to the timing of batch production and a million increase in contract research related to clinical trials 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs related to stock compensation expense of million and an increase in rent of million related to additional office space obtained in  partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in due to the corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of this measure was intended to reduce costs and to align the company s resources with its key strategic priorities 
the restructuring charges included million for employment termination costs payable in cash and a facilities consolidation restructuring charge of million  consisting of lease payments of million related to the net present value of the net future minimum lease payments at the cease use date and the write down of the net book value of fixed assets in the vacated building of million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of million or  from million in due to assets acquired in interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and the decline in interest rates 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the increase of million or was due to the secured loan obtained in june 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources source of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in we have funded our operations principally with million of proceeds from redeemable convertible preferred stock offerings  million of gross proceeds from our ipo in june  million of gross proceeds from our registered direct offering in march  million from the non refundable license fees from the collaboration agreements and million from gsk s investment in the company at the time the collaboration was formed 
in the future  we expect to fund our operations  in part  through the receipt of cost sharing and milestone payments from gsk

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements with regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits  we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
our investment portfolio has not been materially adversely impacted by the recent disruption in the credit markets 
however  if there is continued and expanded disruption in the credit markets  there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a select group of institutional investors 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable any time on or after the six month anniversary of the date they were issued  at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting the placement agency fee and all other estimated offering expenses 
in october  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with gsk  which included the sale of approximately million shares of the company s common stock to gsk at a price of per share 
the total value of this equity investment to the company is approximately million and represents a ownership position in the company 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million due primarily to the net loss for the year ended december  of million  partially offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the change in operating assets and liabilities of million was due primarily to deferred revenue related to the collaboration agreement with gsk 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million due primarily to the operating expenses for the year ended december  of million  partially offset by the reimbursed research and development costs of million 

table of contents net cash used in and provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million

net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by investing activities reflects million for the sale and redemption of marketable securities  offset by million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash provided by and used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was and reflects the million from the issuance of common stock and the million from common stock issued to gsk as part of the collaboration agreement 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the payments of our secured loan agreement and capital lease obligations of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and reflected the proceeds of our secured loan agreement of million and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the payments of our capital lease obligations and secured loan agreement of million and million  respectively 
funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development expenses  including expenses related to conducting clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials of our drug candidates  including amigal  our ability to achieve development and commercialization milestone payments and sales royalties under our collaboration with gsk  the scope  progress  results and costs of preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates including those testing the use of pharmacological chaperones co administered with ert and for the treatment of diseases of neurodegeneration  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone  royalty or other payments from any such collaborators 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from commercial sales for at least the next two years  if at all 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  including anticipated payments from gsk in connection with the collaboration  is expected to be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the anticipated commercial launch of amigal in the united states 
financial uncertainties related to potential future payments milestone payments we have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties 
while our license agreements for amigal and at do not contain milestone payment obligations  two of these agreements related to plicera do require us to make such payments if certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
upon the satisfaction of certain milestones and assuming successful development of plicera  we may be obligated  under the agreements that we have in place  to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million 
however  such potential milestone payments are subject to many uncertain variables that would cause such payments  if any  to vary in size 

table of contents royalties under our license agreements  if we owe royalties on net sales for one of our products to more than one licensor  then we have the right to reduce the royalties owed to one licensor for royalties paid to another 
the amount of royalties to be offset is generally limited in each license and can vary under each agreement 
for amigal and at  we will owe royalties only to mt 
sinai school of medicine mssm 
we would expect to pay royalties to all three licensors with respect to plicera should we advance plicera to commercialization 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are at least a couple years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
in accordance with our license agreement with mssm  we paid million of the million upfront payment received from gsk to mssm in the fourth quarter of we will also be obligated to pay mssm royalties on worldwide net sales of amigal 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
less than over total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations debt obligations total fixed contractual obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities  and d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
we lease office and laboratory space in cranbury  new jersey and these leases will expire by their terms by february in  we leased office and laboratory space in san diego  ca and this lease will expire by its terms in september in may  the company entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank that provides for up to million of equipment financing through october borrowings under the loan agreement are collateralized by equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan and bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately 
on december   we amended the employment agreement with our president and chief executive officer that provides for an annual base salary  a cash bonus of up to of base salary  and monthly payments up to a maximum of million for out of pocket medical expenses and the corresponding tax gross up payments 
the agreement will continue for successive one year terms until either party provides written notice of termination to the other in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we have entered into agreements with clinical research organizations and other outside contractors who are partially responsible for conducting and monitoring our clinical trials for our drug candidates including amigal 
these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table above because we may terminate them without penalty 
we have no other lines of credit or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition related to the milestone method of revenue recognition 
this guidance provides criteria on defining a substantive milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
early adoption is permitted retrospectively from the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
the company early adopted this guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition and retrospectively applied this guidance to the beginning of this method was first applied in conjunction with the license and collaboration agreement with gsk during the fourth quarter of  there have been no milestones recognized in the year of adoption 
this guidance did not have a material impact on the timing or pattern of revenue recognition relative to the agreement nor is expected to in future periods 
in january  the fasb issued amendments to its fair value guidance which requires additional disclosures that include separate disclosures on significant transfers into and out of level  the amount of transfers between level and level and the reasons for such transfers  lower level of disaggregation for fair value disclosures by class rather than by major category and additional details on the valuation techniques and inputs used to determine level and level measurements 
the company has included these additional disclosures within the form k for the period ended december  and they did not have a significant impact on the financial statements disclosures of the company 
in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition related to multiple element arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities and us government agency notes with maturities of less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and  due to the short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure and consistent with our investment policy  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

as december   our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were all due on demand or within one year 
our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and therefore  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations

if exchange rates undergo a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
