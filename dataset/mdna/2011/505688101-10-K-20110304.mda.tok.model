once a product design is approved for production  responsibility is shared with outside sourcing facilities or with our domestic manufacturing facility for pattern development and commercialization 
our presence in portland  oregon provides access to a broad talent pool of footwear design professionals 
customers  sales  and distribution channels we market our two brands  lacrosse and danner  through four channels of distribution wholesale  government  direct  and international 
within the wholesale channel  the lacrosse and danner brands are marketed through our employee field sales staff and certain independent distributors 
a national account sales team complements the sales activities for the brands

our wholesale customer base is diversified as to size and location of customers and markets served 
the government channel  in which we position the danner brand  provides performance footwear built to meet the demands and specific requirements for multiple branches of the us military as well as federal  state  and other government agencies 
many of these products are manufactured in the company s iso certified manufacturing facility located in portland  oregon

manufacturing and sourcing manufacturing overview we source approximately two thirds of the products we sell through a network of international contract manufacturers  primarily in asia  with the remaining one third manufactured domestically in our portland  oregon facility 
in august  we moved our danner factory to a  square foot industrial building approximately one mile from our corporate headquarters 
our new facility significantly enables us to extend our great tradition of superior craftsmanship by significantly increasing our capacity to meet demand from our customers in the work  military  law enforcement  outdoor recreation  hunting and japanese markets who depend on our us manufactured danner footwear being crafted to the very highest standards 
furthermore  this state of the art facility allows us to continue to innovate with new footwear designs and production processes by expanding our overall capabilities and capacity 
the new factory also improves our operating efficiencies by incorporating the latest lean manufacturing techniques to meet at once demand 

table of contents sourcing overview lacrosse international  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of lacrosse footwear  inc with an office in zhongshan  china 
lacrosse international has three primary functions work with suppliers to maintain our standards for high quality products  locate and develop relationships with complementary sourcing alternatives  and increase speed to market for new products 
we do not have any long term contracts with our contract manufacturers  choosing instead to retain the flexibility to re evaluate our sourcing and manufacturing base on an ongoing basis 
substantially all of our transactions with our foreign contract manufacturers are denominated in us dollars 
however  these us dollar prices are impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we regularly evaluate our vendors on the quality of their work  cost and ability to deliver on time 
the raw materials used in production of our products are primarily leather and crude rubber 
we have historically been able to recover any significant increases in raw material costs as well as increases in direct labor costs through associated product price increases 
both our contract manufacturers and our domestic manufacturing facility purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both lacrosse and danner footwear 
gore tex is a registered trademark of gore 
over of danner styles are lined with gore tex 
while we believe that our relationship with gore is good  our contracts with gore are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
in the event the relationship was to terminate  we have identified other sources of products with similar characteristics 
competition the categories of the footwear markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete with numerous other manufacturers and distributors  many of whom have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
because we have a broad product line  our competition varies by product category 
we believe that we maintain a competitive position through the strength of our brands  our attention to quality  delivery of value  position as an innovator  our record of delivering products on a timely basis  strong customer relationships  and  in some cases  the breadth of our product line 
certain of our competitors in leather footwear categories have strong brand name recognition in the markets they serve and are the major competitors of our danner and lacrosse leather product lines 
these competitors manufacture domestically and or import products from offshore 
domestically manufactured danner brand products are generally at a price disadvantage against lower cost imported products 
danner focuses on the premium quality  premium price segment of the market in which product function  design  comfort  quality  continued technological improvements  brand awareness  and timeliness of product delivery are the overriding characteristics that consumers demand 
by devoting attention to these factors  we believe that the danner footwear line has maintained a strong competitive position in our market 
several rubber boot marketers with strong brand recognition in their respective markets are competitors of the lacrosse brand 
we occupy a favorable niche in the higher price segments of the work and outdoor rubber boot markets 
our history of supplying quality rubber boots  all of which are currently sourced from overseas suppliers  has provided a foundation to compete effectively 
other suppliers offer similar products  some at lower prices and quality levels  against which we must effectively compete 
we believe that our superior quality products  innovation and design leadership  coupled with solid delivery and customer support enables us to effectively compete in this market 

table of contents employees as of december   we had employees located in the united states  employees in china and in denmark 
substantially all employees are full time 
approximately employees in our portland  oregon facilities are represented by the united food commercial workers union ufcw under a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in january trademarks and trade names  patents we own united states federal registrations for several of our trademarks  including lacrosse  danner  burly  alpha burly  the stylized indianhead design that serves as our logo  ice king  iceman  terra force  hyper dri  camohide tm  acadia  quad comfort  striker  pronghorn tm  and tfx 
we rely on common law trademark rights for all unregistered brands 
we defend our trademarks and trade names against infringement to the fullest extent practicable under the law 
each federally registered trademark is renewable indefinitely if the trademark is still in use at the time of renewal 
pursuant to our agreements with gore we are permitted to use the gore tex mark to designate our footwear styles lined with gore tex waterproof fabric 
we also own several united states patents related to our footwear and have other technologies that are patent pending at this time 
our portfolio of issued patents currently extends as far as we register our trademarks  tradenames and patents in foreign jurisdictions based on the footwear styles and brands introduced to the relevant jurisdiction 
seasonality sales have been historically higher during the second half of the year due primarily to greater consumer demand for our outdoor product offerings during the fall and winter months 
accordingly  the amount of our fixed operating expenses represents a larger percentage of our net sales in the first two quarters than in the last two quarters of each year 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the coming periods 
we place orders for products sourced from overseas suppliers during the first quarter with anticipated deliveries starting late in the second quarter 
as a result  our inventories generally peak early in the third quarter  and then trend down to the end of the year 
factors other than seasonality could have a significant impact on our sales backlog 
our order backlog may experience cancellations by our customers 
accordingly  our backlog at any point in time may not be indicative of future results 
additionally  the timing of receipt of large military contracts has historically caused fluctuations in our quarterly revenue patterns 
during periods in which we receive fewer military contract sales  our fixed operating expenses will represent a larger percentage of net sales 
foreign operations and sales outside of the united states as previously noted  we maintain offices in china and denmark to support our contract manufacturers and european sales staff  respectively 
our sales outside of the unites states are conducted through our european subsidiary  our japan distributor  and certain other distribution partners 
such sales accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in   and  respectively 

table of contents the net book value of fixed assets located outside of the us totaled million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
such assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets  office equipment and software 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to waterways and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
such laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately assess the effect they will have on our operations in the future 
compliance with federal  state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had  nor are they anticipated to have in the future  a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position

risk factors in evaluating our company  careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  future operating results and or financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

table of contents sales to the us government  which are becoming an increasingly significant portion of our net sales  may not continue at current levels  or we may not be able to fill these orders due to facility constraints 
additionally  we may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenue performance due to the timing of orders and requested shipment dates for us government contract orders 
our ability to continue to generate sales growth in the government channel is partially dependent upon a wide range of factors  some of which are outside of our ability to control 
such factors include the current us government s policies regarding troop deployments in various global regions requiring our specialized footwear  the potential for reductions in the us budget  our ability to meet aggressive delivery schedules  and increased competition from other footwear suppliers who may compete more effectively on the basis of price 
additionally  a substantial portion of our us government sales must be produced by our domestic manufacturing facility 
we may experience disruptions in manufacturing and shipping products to our customers 
any such delay or disruption would adversely affect our results of operations 
being unable to fill orders on a timely basis could cause us to lose future orders from these sources and other customers in the work  law enforcement  japanese and other markets who depend on our us manufactured danner footwear being crafted to the very highest standards and being delivered on schedule 
given that government orders can be sporadic  we may incur fixed costs associated with this operation even if the orders do not support such levels of fixed costs 
if government orders do not continue at current levels  or if we are unable to fill orders  it would have a negative impact on our earnings and results of operations 
for all of our distribution channels  including domestic retailers  a deterioration in the general business environment and lack of growth in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic and consumer credit conditions could create an environment of increasing price discounts which would negatively impact our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
our success in generating sales of our products to consumers depends upon a number of factors  including economic factors impacting disposable consumer income 
these economic factors include considerations such as employment levels  general business conditions  consumer confidence  prevailing interest rates and changes in tax laws 
in addition  spending patterns of consumers may be affected by changes in the amount or severity of inclement weather  the acceptability of us brands in international markets and the growth or decline of global footwear markets 
reduced levels of consumer spending may negatively impact our domestic wholesale partners  which would impact their financial operations and their access to capital to fund growth  which increases and concentrates our credit risk 
a contraction in consumer spending and tightening of credit markets creates an unfavorable business environment for our wholesale partners  especially those who use debt to finance their inventory purchases and other operating capital requirements 
if our wholesale partners are unable to obtain financing for their inventory purchases and to fund their operations  it could result in delayed payment or non payment of amounts owed to us and or a reduction in the number of sales we make to such wholesale partners  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in the price or availability of raw materials and labor in the global market  as well as currency fluctuation and other risks associated with international operations could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results  particularly our gross margins 
raw materials and component parts are purchased by us and our third party manufacturers from various suppliers to be used in the manufacturing of our products 
changes in relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of purchased raw materials or component parts could result in manufacturing interruptions  delays or inefficiencies and could affect our ability to successfully market our products 
these occurrences would negatively affect our business  product gross margins and results of operations 

table of contents our product costs are subject to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the chinese renminbi  rubber price increases  oil price increases  higher foreign labor costs and other variable costs associated with our operations including trade laws  duties and taxes  and other product sourcing costs 
if we are unable to increase our selling prices to offset such cost increases  our revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted 
if petroleum costs were to increase  it could result in significantly higher freight costs to our company  as we rely on transport companies to deliver our products from abroad to our distribution centers  and in some cases directly to our customers 
increased petroleum costs also affect our manufacturing costs 
foreign currency fluctuations and increased labor cost abroad would be problematic given our dependence on manufacturing in asia and distribution through our european subsidiary 
our profit margins may increase or decrease as foreign currency rates  prices of petroleum  and the cost of foreign labor fluctuate and we are unable to pass those costs on to our customers 
we may experience consolidation in our raw materials supply base for outsoles and leather  which presents overall risks in our supply base 
interruptions in supply of raw materials or increased costs for such raw materials could negatively impact the operations of our domestic manufacturing facility as well as our international manufacturing partners 
raw materials supply constraints or price increases could negatively impact our customer relationships  our ability to fill current and future orders and our results of operations 
our european subsidiary  lacrosse europe aps  increases our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations and the outsourcing of our european distribution center 
foreign operations through our european subsidiary increases our exposure to risks associated with foreign currency transactions and compliance with foreign laws 
also  our distribution center for europe is owned and managed by an independent third party  which increases our risks associated with inventory management and timely and accurate customer shipments 
any negative outcome related to these risks would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our profitability is significantly dependent upon future effective tax rates for federal  state and international taxing jurisdictions 
tax rates on corporations may be increased in future periods 
higher effective federal  state and international tax rates would lower our earnings performance and restrict our ability to invest in various areas of our business 
future changes to rates of taxation in areas outside of the us could also negatively impact our future earnings performance 

table of contents we conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing activities and a certain portion of our net sales occurs outside the us  therefore we are subject to the risks of international commerce 
also  any adverse political conditions or governmental actions  including the imposition of duties and quotas  internally within china where the majority of our third party manufacturers are concentrated or externally with nafta countries and the european union could disrupt our supply of product to customers 
we use third party manufacturers located in foreign countries  primarily in asia  to manufacture the majority of our products  including all of our lacrosse branded products 
foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks  including the following delays associated with the manufacture  transportation and delivery of foreign sourced products  tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules  delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns  labor disputes at various ports or other events  foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the chinese renminbi  a risk which we do not currently seek to mitigate through hedging transactions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  changing economic conditions  restrictions  due to privacy laws  on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information  changes in governmental policies and regulations  political unrest  terrorism or war  any of which can interrupt commerce  work slowdowns  stoppages  strikes  expropriation or nationalization affecting our manufacturing partners  difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the us  difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  limited capital of foreign distributors and the possibility that such distributors may terminate their operations or their relationships with us  and concentration of credit risk  currency  and political risks associated with international distributors 
additionally  although net sales outside of the us do not constitute a significant portion of our revenues  we expect our international sales will grow over the next few years 
our ability to continue to do business in international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations  as noted above  as well as the difficulties associated with promoting products in emerging markets 
we are also subject to additional risk as we have a limited number of foreign distributors  who may have inadequate capital to continue operations over the long term 
certain of our sales to the international markets are achieved through those foreign distributors  principally in japan 
our sales and sales growth may be adversely affected if our relationships with those distributors were to deteriorate and we are unable to engage suitable alternatives in a timely manner 
furthermore  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into nafta or european union countries and into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents because we depend on third party manufacturers  we face challenges in maintaining a timely supply of goods to meet sales demand  and we may experience delay or interruptions in our supply chain 
any shortfall or delay in the supply of our products may decrease our sales and have an adverse impact on our customer relationships 
third party manufacturers located primarily in asia produce approximately two thirds of our footwear products 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over the third party manufacturers  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
due to various potential factors outside of our control  one or more of our third party manufacturers may be unable to continue meeting our production requirements 
also  certain of our third party manufacturers have manufacturing arrangements with companies that are much larger than we are and whose production needs are much greater than ours 
as a result  such manufacturers may choose to devote additional resources to the production of products other than ours if their capacity is limited 
in addition  we do not have long term supply contracts with these third party manufacturers  and any of them could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of products of an acceptable quality and price from our third party manufacturers 
we may be unable to offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in our company operated manufacturing facility due to capacity constraints  and we may be unable to substitute suitable alternative third party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices 
any disruption in the supply of products from our third party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is substantially affected by weather conditions  and sustained periods of warm and or dry weather can negatively impact our sales 
additionally  such weather conditions may negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period sales 
we sell our products into two primary markets  work and outdoor 
for the year ended december   of our annual revenues were to the outdoor market 
this market category is highly seasonal and weather dependent 
sales of these products are largely dependent on the timing and severity of weather in the different regions of the united states and europe 
during sustained periods of warm and or dry weather conditions  certain key categories in the outdoor market may be negatively impacted  including hunting  hiking and cold weather products  as consumers postpone purchases of our products pending the resumption of more conducive weather patterns 
additionally  given our advance ordering timelines  such reduced demand during normal outdoor market seasons may also negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period profits as such excess inventories are sold 
if we do not accurately forecast consumer demand  we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers orders  either of which could adversely affect our business 
the footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations and declines in performance  as well as fashion risks and rapid changes in consumer preferences  the effects of weather  general economic conditions and other factors affecting demand 
furthermore  the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for the design and manufacture of products 
consequently  we must commit to production based on our forecasts of consumer demand 
if we overestimate demand for our products  we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at a discount to customers  resulting in markdowns and lower gross margins 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand  we could have inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to 
table of contents customers  strains on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
a decline in demand for our products  or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
labor disruptions or disruptions due to natural disasters or casualty losses at one of our distribution facilities or our domestic manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
some of our employees at our danner distribution and manufacturing facilities are organized in a labor union  the united food and commercial workers union 
our inability to renew  on favorable terms  the collective bargaining agreement between us and the union that represents our employees  or any strike  work stoppage or other labor disruption could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  any natural disaster or other serious disruption at one of these facilities  including our distribution facility in indianapolis  indiana  and third party manufactures due to fire  earthquake  tornadoes  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or manmade cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our warehouse for our products 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our financial success may be limited by the strength of our relationships with our wholesale customers and by the success of such wholesale customers 
our financial success is significantly related to the willingness of our wholesale customers to continue to carry our products and to the success of such customers in selling our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our wholesale customers 
sales to our wholesale customers are increasingly on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer 
if we cannot fill our wholesale customers orders in a timely manner  the sales of our products and our relationships with those customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on our sales and ability to grow our product line 
if any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us in the future 
in addition  we extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
if a significant customer to whom we have extended credit experiences financial difficulties  our bad debt expense may increase relative to revenues in the future  which would adversely impact our net income and cash flow 
we face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively  sales of our products may decline and our business could be harmed 
the footwear industry is highly competitive 
some of our competitors have products with similar characteristics  such as design and materials  with certain of our products 
in addition  access to offshore manufacturing is also making it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete 
the footwear industry includes footwear manufacturers  fashion oriented footwear marketers  vertically integrated specialty stores and retailers of private label products 
our principal competitive differentiators include product design  product performance  quality  brand image  marketing and promotion  customer support and service  the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers  and others 
certain of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and stronger brand recognition than we have 
additionally  they have greater distribution capabilities and a broader market presence in retail outlets  or have their own retail outlets 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future  our sales and profits may decline and our financial condition may deteriorate 

table of contents we may be unable to meet changing consumer preferences and demands 
the footwear industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and functional products that are competitive with other brands in our market 
in addition  we must design and manufacture products that appeal to many consumer markets at a range of price points 
while we continually update our product line with new and innovative products  our products may not continue to be popular and new products we introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
our failure to anticipate  identify and react to shifts in consumer preferences and maintain a strong brand image could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position and reduce future revenues 
protecting our intellectual property is an important factor in maintaining our brand and our competitive position in the footwear industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
we have a number of licensing agreements  both for product  camouflage patterns and trademarks  which are significant to our business 
if we are unable to renew the agreements  and suitable replacements are not available in a timely manner  our revenues could be negatively impacted 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials  and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs 
we depend on a limited number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear 
for example  we and our suppliers purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both our lacrosse and danner footwear 
over three fourths of danner styles are gore tex lined 
while we consider our relationship with gore to be good  the agreements with gore are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
if gore were to terminate our agreements  the time required to obtain substitute materials could interrupt our production cycle 
additionally  consumers may be unwilling to accept any such replacement material 
any termination or delay in our supply of gore tex waterproof fabric or the loss of our ability to use the gore tex mark in association with our products  or in the procurement of any other key product component  could result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strained relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  product development engineers  sales people  and others 
we face competition for such individuals throughout the footwear and work and outdoor products industries 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

table of contents if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility  we may be unable to maintain existing  or secure additional financing  and repayment obligations on any outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated 
our revolving credit facility contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply 
our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results  which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non compliance  we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable  which could harm our business 
at december  we had no outstanding borrowing under this credit facility 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws and wisconsin corporate law each contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management 
among other things  these provisions classify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and establish advance notice and other procedural requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions  which may prevent a change of control and or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable 
in addition  subchapter xi of the wisconsin business corporation law includes provisions that may discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to maximize the work and outdoor experience for our consumers 
to achieve this  we design  develop  manufacture and market premium quality  high performance footwear  supported by compelling marketing and superior customer service 
our trusted danner and lacrosse brands are sold through four channels of distribution wholesale government direct and international 
we focus on two types of consumers for our footwear lines work and outdoor 
work consumers include people in military services  law enforcement  transportation  mining  oil and gas exploration and extraction  construction and other occupations that require high performance and protective footwear as a critical tool for the job 
outdoor consumers include people active in hunting  outdoor cross training  hiking and other outdoor recreational activities 
weather  especially in the fall and winter  has been  and will likely continue to be  a significant contributing factor impacting our financial performance 
our sales are typically higher in the second half of the year due to stronger demand for our cold and wet weather outdoor product offerings 
we augment these offerings by infusing innovative technology into all product categories with the intent to create additional demand in all four quarters of the year 
our sales performance continues to be driven by the success of our new product lines  our ability to meet at once demand  and our ability to diversify and strengthen our portfolio of sales channels 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenue performance due to the timing of orders and requested shipment dates for us government contract orders 
future us government sales are dependent upon a wide range of factors  some of which are outside of our control 
such factors include the us government s policies regarding troop deployments in global regions requiring our specialized footwear  our ability to meet aggressive delivery schedules and increased competition from other footwear suppliers 
we continually evaluate our portfolio of product offerings to ensure we are providing innovative and high performance products to the marketplace 
as a part of this evaluation process  during we decided to discontinue our offerings in the apparel business  which has historically represented approximately million of annual net sales 
we believe that our remaining apparel inventories will be sold by the end of the second quarter of and will have a negligible impact on our gross margins 
one of our key contract manufacturers experienced capacity constraints during  which negatively affected our supply of certain leather footwear products during the year 
additionally  we have seen a trend of increasing raw materials prices 
we have taken steps to pursue various alternatives to improve capacity  manage product costs  and maintain product availability to meet forecasted demand for the long term

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded working capital requirements and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit agreement or other long term lending arrangements 
we require working capital to support fluctuating accounts receivable and inventory levels caused by our seasonal business cycle 
working capital requirements are generally the lowest in the first quarter and the highest during the third quarter 
on march   we entered into a year extension of our previous line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which expires june  amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the maximum aggregate principal amount of borrowings allowed from january to may is million and from june to december  the total available is million 
there are no borrowing base limitations under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for an interest rate of libor plus and an annual commitment fee of on the unused balance 
at december  and  we had no outstanding balances due under this financing agreement 
see note  financing arrangements and note subsequent events to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on january   we entered into a letter amendment to our line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na which increased the allowable capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  and increased allowable cash dividends for the year ending december  on september   we entered into a second letter amendment to our line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na which increased the allowable capital expenditures for the remainder of on january   we entered into a third letter amendment to our line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na which increased the allowable capital expenditures for the remainder of the credit agreement term 
in june  we received a grant of million and a non interest bearing loan of million from the portland development commission  which were used to finance certain leasehold improvements at our portland distribution facility 
the grant is recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized as a reduction of operating expenses on a straight line basis over five years  which is the estimated useful life of the associated leasehold improvements 
in the third quarter of  the loan was forgiven by the portland development commission and accordingly we have reclassified the remaining unamortized long term debt to deferred revenue and will continue to amortize the balance until in may  we received a loan of million from the state of oregon to finance certain equipment purchases at our new danner factory which began production in the third quarter of the state of oregon will forgive all  or a portion of the loan  along with all interest accruing on any portion of the loan forgiven upon meeting employment criteria at the danner factory 
the employment criteria require us to maintain a certain number of employees at the danner factory over a consecutive eight quarter period beginning july  and ending no later than september  at that time the remaining loan balance which has not been forgiven will bear interest at per annum and will mature on october  as we meet the specified employment criteria at the danner factory during a given period  beginning with the fourth quarter of  a corresponding portion of the loan will be reclassified to deferred revenue and amortized over the life of the factory lease 
consolidated statements of cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million for the decline in cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily related to an increase in our inventories  partially offset by a greater accounts payable in as compared to the higher inventory 
table of contents build up in is primarily attributable to a planned increase in inventory of core products intended to improve availability for at once demand 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily related to increased inventory purchases as well as the timing of payments to our third party manufacturers for inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in we purchased property and equipment of million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures during primarily represent investments in our new factory store and danner factory which opened during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
in  capital expenditures included million related to racking  computer systems and other build out costs in our new indianapolis distribution center in the first half of during  we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase of million was attributable to higher dividends of million  which represents a special dividend of per share paid in the first quarter of  partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options million and proceeds from a long term debt agreement with the state of oregon for the danner factory facility million 
on february   we announced a first quarter cash dividend of twelve and one half cents per share of common stock 
this dividend will be paid on march  to shareholders of record on february  and amount to approximately million 
at december  and  our pension plan had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the respective plan assets of million and million  respectively 
this obligation in excess of plan assets and accrued liabilities resulted in a cumulative reduction of equity  net of tax  of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to the pension plan in off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than operating leases and purchase commitments that are disclosed in the contractual obligations table below and in our consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any special purpose entities established by us  at our direction or for our benefit 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases product purchase obligations see part i  item properties for a description of our leased facilities 
from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers and third party manufacturers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 

table of contents we also have a commercial line of credit as described below  which is more fully described under the caption liquidity and capital resources other commercial maximum amount commitment committed outstanding at date of expiration line of credit  june  we believe that our existing resources  our commercial line of credit and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts and non defective returns ownership of our products transfers to the customer when the product is delivered to a third party carrier at one of our distribution facilities or upon receipt at our customers designated facilities depending upon the applicable terms of the customer order 
significant judgment is required when determining the allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts  and non defective returns  each of which reduces the amount of accounts receivable and operating income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our historical experience of write offs of uncollectible accounts has been insignificant 
in addition to an allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for anticipated cash discounts to be taken by customers and for non defective returns 
cash discounts are provided under certain customer service programs and are estimated based on available programs and historical usage rates 
reserves for non defective returns are estimated based on historical rates of return 
allowance for slow moving inventory provision for potentially slow moving or excess inventories is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  future sales forecasts and current estimated market values 
actual customer requirements and market values in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products for a specified time period after sale 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such anticipated costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include sales experience along with historical and anticipated future rates of warranty claims 
we also utilize information received from customers to assist in determining the appropriate warranty accrual levels 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill and property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill of million and the investments we have made in property and equipment  we have analyzed our market capitalization together with assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 

table of contents please refer to the risk factors in part i  item a for a discussion of factors that may have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note  compensation and benefit agreements to our annual consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or material changes in our assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations  our future expense and shareholders equity 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a in this annual report on form k for further sensitivity analysis regarding our estimated pension obligation 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance our deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance related to the state of wisconsin net operating loss nol carryforwards  as realization of nol carryforwards is dependent upon having taxable income in wisconsin in future periods 
the remaining balance of the deferred taxes after such valuation allowance represents the portion of wisconsin nol carryforwards which management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
stock based compensation the company estimates the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  share based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to calculate the share based compensation expense  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of option based awards on the date of grant is impacted by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding certain highly subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the anticipated risk free interest rate  anticipated future dividend yields and the expected life of the options 
the anticipated risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options granted 
the expected volatility  life of options and dividend yield are based on historical experience 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers and information on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under level of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the adoption of this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we have adopted this guidance in the financial statements presented herein  which did not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
our line of credit interest rate is the libor rate plus 
using an average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would impact the company s annual interest expense by approximately million 
we are also exposed to market risk related to the assumptions we make in estimating our pension liability 
the assumed discount rate used  in part  to calculate the pension plan obligation is related to the prevailing long term interest rates 
at december   we used an estimated discount rate of 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the actuarial present value of projected pension benefits of approximately million at december  at december   we used an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
the historical annualized ten year rate of return on pension plan assets is approximately 
a one percent change in the actual rate of return on pension plan assets would affect the charge to equity by approximately million 
our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
our net investment exposure in our foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in recorded value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  at december  we had no formal plans to liquidate any of our operating foreign subsidiaries within the consolidated group  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not affect our results of operations
