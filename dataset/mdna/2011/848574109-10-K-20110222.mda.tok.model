item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and the selected consolidated financial information and other data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that must be understood in the context of numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this annual report 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
our results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
recent events on january   we announced that we reached an agreement with the boeing company regarding certain claims associated with the development and production of the airplane in december the agreement provides that the parties will complete formal amendments in the first half of the impact of the agreement was included in our fourth quarter and full year results 
for further discussion see item  business our relationship with boeing  in this annual report 
on november   boeing announced the postponement of further flight test activities on the b  following the occurrence of an onboard electrical fire 
on december   boeing announced that it was resuming test flight activities on the b that day 
on january   boeing announced that it expects delivery of the first b to take place in the third quarter of overview we are one of the largest independent non oem original equipment manufacturer aircraft parts designers and manufacturers of commercial aerostructures in the world  based on annual revenues  as well as the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to boeing 
in addition  we are one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to airbus 
boeing and airbus are the two largest aircraft oems in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which includes forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which includes nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components  and wing systems  which includes wings  wing components  flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts 
all other activities fall within the all other segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other companies that have operations in wichita 
the fuselage systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita  kansas and kinston  north carolina 
the propulsion systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita  kansas 
the wing systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma  prestwick  scotland  subang  malaysia and kinston  north carolina 
fuselage systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and less than respectively  of our net revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the global industry s revenue rebounded sharply in for both passenger air traffic and cargo freight  after significant contraction in and one key near term variable affecting the industry is fuel costs  which are expected to rise in  possibly deteriorating the industry s profit margins 
if fuel costs were to rise near the recent highs of  airlines might respond with canceled or deferred orders 
however  boeing and airbus have indicated that they do not anticipate any near term erosion to their backlogs 
both oem s have announced multiple production rate increases  commencing in with the respective single aisle programs airbus a and boeing b 

table of contents demand for commercial aerostructures is highly correlated to demand for new aircraft 
from through  boeing and airbus experienced an unprecedented order intake and backlog growth 
in that period  the two manufacturers obtained combined total gross orders of approximately  aircraft 
their aggregate backlog increased from nearly  to over  aircraft 
an order slowdown in resulted in a decrease in aggregate backlog 
however  net orders for rebounded from the previous year 
commercial net orders were  in  resulting in a backlog increase of aircraft 
high backlog levels are expected to continue to drive increasing production and delivery forecasts in the near to mid term from both boeing and airbus 
the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through and delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced that it expects its deliveries to be between we expect airbus deliveries to be approximately in inventory continues to grow in terms of absolute dollars and remains stable as a percentage of total assets 
inventory as a percentage of total assets was  and at december    and  respectively 
this overall trend in inventory is driven primarily by our contractually required investments in new programs which include the boeing b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for an increase in inventory from to of million  which is net of a million forward loss provision recorded in as a reduction to inventory on our g contract 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in inventory from mature boeing and airbus programs 
the increases in inventory for new programs in the last few years are a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting with regard to inventory and revenue recognition 
under this method  investments in new contracts  including contractual pre production costs and recurring production costs in excess of the projected average cost to manufacture all units in the contract block  initially accumulate in inventory for the related contract 
once production has reached a point where the cost to produce a ship set falls below such projected average cost  the inventory balance for such program will begin to decrease 
as many of our new programs are either in the pre production phase or the early stages of recurring production  we expect that inventory balances will continue to increase in deferred inventory costs are evaluated for recoverability through their inclusion in the total costs used in the calculation of each contract s estimated profit margin 
when the estimated total contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues  an inventory reserve is established 
new program performance we are currently performing work on several new programs  which are in various stages of development 
several of these programs entered flight testing during the fourth quarter of  including the boeing b  gulfstream g  and gulfstream g which includes the rolls royce br and we delivered revenue generating production units for all of these programs in in addition  we are working on the new boeing b derivative the b  which entered flight testing in february of certain of these programs continue to pose a risk of additional charges and or forward losses given the low margins that are currently forecasted and cost pressure that has continued through the fourth quarter of in  we recorded a million unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment related to periods prior to on our sikorsky ch k contract as a result of additional costs required to meet test hardware schedules 
we continue to see risk for cost growth on this program  which has deteriorated current margins on our contract to break even 
our estimated margins on the initial rolls royce br contract continue to be zero 
the g program is experiencing cost growth as we progress through the certification process 
we are currently in the process of restructuring the major cost elements of the g program in order to drive cost savings 
a forward loss on this program continues to be a significant risk and is dependent upon our ability to successfully perform under the 
table of contents revised reduced cost structure as we enter into production 
we are also estimating zero margins on a contract related to the wing portion of the b program 
the b contract profitability will depend on our ability to achieve cost reduction opportunities as we increase production levels in the coming months and years 
during the fourth quarter of  based on a comprehensive analysis of our contract  we revised our contract estimates to reflect a break even margin  which resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment in the fourth quarter which was a million charge 
a forward loss on this program continues to be a significant risk until planned cost reductions are realized through performance initiatives 
the next six to twelve months will be a critical time for these programs as we manufacture the initial units and establish baseline performance for the recurring cost structure 
if we are not able to achieve anticipated productivity and cost improvements  or if external factors such as market demand trend unfavorably  additional charges  including forward loss reserves  may be recorded in future periods 
basis of presentation the financial statements include spirit s financial statements and the financial statements of its majority owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
investments in business entities in which we do not have control  but have the ability to exercise influence over operating and financial policies  are accounted for by the equity method 
kansas industrial energy supply company kiesc  a tenancy in common with other wichita companies established to purchase natural gas  is fully consolidated as spirit owns of the entity s equity 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
spirit s uk subsidiary uses local currency  the british pound  as its functional currency 
all other foreign subsidiaries use local currency as their functional currency with the exception of our malaysian subsidiary  which uses the british pound  and our french subsidiary  which uses the us dollar 
as part of the monthly consolidation process  the functional currency is translated to us dollars using the end of month currency translation rate for balance sheet accounts and average period currency translation rates for revenue and income accounts as defined by fasb authoritative guidance on foreign currency translation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of the company s revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
the company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones or use of the cost to cost method  that are indicative of our progress 
table of contents toward completion depending on facts and circumstances 
we follow the requirements of fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates are recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs of a contract 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the contract 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin contract block is predicated upon contractual terms and market forecasts 
the assumed timeframe period covered by the contract block is generally equal to the period specified in the contract or the future timeframe for which we can project reasonably dependable cost estimates 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contracts span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenues earned from providing maintenance services including any contracted research and development are recognized when the service is complete or other contractual milestones are attained 
since boeing retained title to tooling assets and provides such tooling to the company at no cost  the company treats the amortization of boeing owned tooling as a reduction to revenues as required by fasb authoritative guidance on consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including resellers of the vendor s product 
these items are netted against gross revenues in calculating net revenues 
the company expects to recognize no reductions to net revenues in for boeing tooling  as the tooling became fully amortized in however  under an agreement with airbus  certain payments that are also accounted for as consideration given by a vendor to a customer will be amortized as a reduction to net revenues beginning in new programs a significant portion of the company s future revenues is expected to be derived from new programs  most notably the b  on which we may be contracted to provide design and engineering services  recurring production  or both 
there are several risks inherent to such new programs 
in the design and engineering phase  we may incur costs in excess of our forecasts due to several factors  including cost overruns  customer directed change orders and delays in the overall program 
we may also incur higher than expected recurring production costs  which may be caused by a variety of factors  including the future impact of engineering changes or other change orders or our inability to secure contracts with our suppliers at projected cost levels 
our ability to recover these excess costs from the customer will depend on several factors  including our rights under our contracts for the new programs 
in determining our profits and losses in accordance with the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs  as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables 
we continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience 
if we make material changes to our assumptions  such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract which could be caused by emerging 
table of contents market trends or other factors  an increase in future production costs or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs  we may experience negative cumulative catch up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized 
in some cases  we may recognize forward loss amounts 
for a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new programs  see risk factors risk factors related to our business and industry 
inventory raw materials are stated at lower of cost principally on an actual or average cost basis or market 
inventoried costs attributed to units delivered under long term contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining revenues of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period the loss becomes known  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
costs in inventory include amounts relating to contracts with long production cycles  some of which are not expected to be realized within one year 
the company reviews its general stock materials and spare parts inventory each quarter to identify impaired inventory  including excess or obsolete inventory  based on historical sales trends and expected production usage 
impaired inventories are written off in the period identified 
finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized 
tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for tax credits 
under this method  tax credits reduce income tax expense 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on employers accounting for pensions  post retirement benefits other than pensions  defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 

table of contents we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted fasb authoritative guidance which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours  which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans that include restricted share grants and restricted stock units

table of contents for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for boeing aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for airbus aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
other components which are part of the same aircraft ship sets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or ship set deliveries  which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various ship set components in any given period

under our contract for this program  we have the exclusive right to design  develop and manufacture wing components over the life of the program 
the contract provides for fixed prices  which are subject to annual formulaic adjustments based on changes in certain specified cost indices 
in addition  the g contract requires us to fund certain up front development expenses 
the g program charge resulted from the combination of higher than anticipated non recurring costs  increased forecasted costs on recurring production and a decrease in the estimated number of units to be produced over which the increased non recurring costs will be spread 
the increases in costs were driven by several factors  including changing technical requirements  overspending on the design and engineering phase of the program and uncertainty in our ability to secure long term contracts with suppliers at projected cost levels 
the decrease in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract was due to deterioration in the global economy and decreasing demand for mid sized 
table of contents business jets 
further cost increases or an inability to meet revised recurring cost forecasts on the g program may result in additional forward loss reserves in future periods  while improvements in future costs compared to current estimates may result in favorable adjustments if forward loss reserves are no longer required 
twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december   were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with net revenues of  million for the prior year 
the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in ship set deliveries in for the boeing b as compared to as the lingering effects of the iam strike at boeing impacted the first quarter deliveries 
in addition  deliveries for the boeing b also increased driven by customer delivery schedule 
non recurring revenues  which are derived primarily from engineering and design efforts  were million and million for each of the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
favorable volume based pricing adjustments of million were recorded in as a result of lower deliveries due to the iam strike at boeing as compared with million of such adjustments recorded during the same period of the strengthening dollar during resulted in an million decrease in the value of net revenues from spirit europe 
deliveries to boeing increased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year  mostly due to increases in b and b ship set deliveries  partially offset by a decrease in b ship set deliveries driven by customer delivery schedule 
deliveries to airbus decreased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year due to a customer delivery re phasing at spirit europe which reduced third quarter a deliveries 
we re aligned with customer a delivery levels in the fourth quarter of in total  ship set deliveries decreased to ship sets in compared to  ship sets for the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to reduced deliveries of hawker  a and a ship sets  which are not a significant source of revenue  partially offset by increased boeing ship set deliveries 
approximately of spirit s net revenues for came from our two largest customers  boeing and airbus 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was for the twelve months ended december   as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in is primarily due to the absence of unusual charges recorded in  consisting of million related to a forward loss on our g contract and the cessna citation columbus program termination  as well as an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million in during  we recorded expenses of approximately million associated with the shares granted to eligible iam represented employees at the ratification of a new ten year agreement on june   million in early retirement incentives accepted by iam represented employees in the third quarter of also in accordance with the new ten year contract  and million associated with shares granted to eligible uaw represented employees at the ratification of a new ten year contract on december  we updated our contract profitability estimates resulting in an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million driven by a million charge on our hawker xp contract related to the decision to exit the program  million unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment related to periods prior to on our sikorsky ch k contract as a result of additional costs required to meet test hardware schedules  and million recorded in the propulsion segment primarily driven by the fourth quarter of comprehensive analysis of our contract  during which we revised our contract estimates to reflect a break even margin  partially offset by favorable performance trends on mature programs 
we also recorded a million forward loss charge for tooling contracts for the g program in in addition to these specific charges  we continue to experience lower profitability on follow on production blocks that began in the fourth quarter of in january  we adopted a change in accounting estimate which extended the useful lives of certain assets 
the effect of this change was a decrease in depreciation charges of million to inventory for  which will eventually flow through cost of sales following the process for contract accounting 
sg a  research and development 
combined sg a and research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues were for both of the twelve month periods ended december  and december  sg a expense increased million  or  primarily due to early retirement incentives offered in  as well as additional sg a expenses incurred as we expanded our global footprint to malaysia  north carolina and france 
in addition  we recognized million in stock compensation expense in sg a during the twelve months ended december   as compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
research and 
table of contents development expenses for the twelve months ended december  were down million  or compared to the same period in the prior year due to the completion of certain a related r d work in operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  compared to operating income of million for the prior year 
operating income increased in primarily due to the absence of charges similar in nature to those recorded in the second quarter of  that are discussed above  partially offset by the decrease in volume based pricing adjustments recorded in  the stock award charge recorded in related to the ratification by iam represented employees as the result of a new ten year agreement  charges associated with the early retirement incentives offered in as part of that contract  and the stock award charge recorded in related to the ratification by uaw represented employees of a new ten year agreement 
operating margins continued to reflect the reduced profitability on follow on production blocks as compared with interest expense and financing fee amortization 
interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended december   includes million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs  as compared to million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs in the prior year 
in june  the company amended its credit facility which resulted in an increase in amortized deferred financing costs 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily driven by interest on the senior unsecured notes issued at the end of the third quarter in  partially offset by interest incurred on the drawn portion of the revolver in the increase in deferred financing fees was primarily the result of a full year discount amortization in on the notes issued in the third quarter of interest income 
interest income for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period in the prior year  which included million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable from boeing for capital expense reimbursement pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the boeing acquisition 
the last of these payments for capital reimbursement was made by boeing to the company in other income expense 
other income expense for included expense of million due to changes in foreign exchange rates on intercompany activity and borrowings  as compared to income of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in expense was driven primarily by the intercompany payable from spirit europe to spirit related to our a xwb program  as well as trade payables and borrowings 
should these balances increase  they will be more susceptible to changes in exchange rates 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises 
events or items that give rise to discrete recognition could include finalizing audit examinations for open tax years  statute of limitations expiration  or a stock acquisition 
the income tax provision for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to million for the prior year 
the effective tax rate was as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate recorded for is related primarily to settling the and us federal examinations  additional state income tax credits  and our tax holiday in malaysia 
the decrease from the us statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the us federal research tax credit  qualified domestic production activities deduction  state income tax credits  and our tax holiday in malaysia

the decrease of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to lower accretion income as a result of a lower outstanding balance on the discounted long term receivable which was collected in full in december and lower interest rates on interest bearing accounts 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises 
events or items that give rise to discrete recognition could include finalizing audit examinations for open tax years  a statute of limitations expiration  or a stock acquisition 
the income tax provision for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to million for the prior year 
the effective tax rate was as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate recorded for is related primarily to additional us federal research and experimentation tax credits 
the decrease from the us statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the us federal research and experimentation tax credit and the qualified domestic production activities deduction 
segments 
segment operating income before unallocated expenses for the twelve months ended december  included several unusual charges  including a million forward loss charge for the gulfstream g business jet program  an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million  the million impact of the cessna citation columbus program termination  and increased r d spending on new programs

fuselage systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended december   were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with fuselage systems segment net revenues of  million for the prior year 
this reflects an increase in deliveries for most boeing large commercial aircraft programs in due to the iam strike in late and delivery of eleven b forward fuselage sections in as compared with three deliveries in the prior year  partially offset by fewer deliveries of b units

unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments of million were recorded in related to periods prior to wing systems 
wing systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended december   were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with wing systems segment net revenues of million for the prior year 
this reflects increased non recurring revenues related to engineering and development work on our new programs 
wing systems recorded segment operating margins of for the twelve months ended december  as compared to reported for the prior year due primarily to a million forward loss charge for the gulfstream g business jet program recorded in the second quarter of  as well as net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments of million realized in related to periods prior to unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments of million were recorded in related to periods prior to all other 
all other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and revenues from kiesc 
in the twelve months ended december   all other segment net revenues were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in net revenues for the twelve months ended december   was primarily driven by a decrease in third party tooling sales 
the all other segment recorded operating margins of for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in margins was primarily due to a million charge recorded in the second quarter of related to tooling for the gulfstream g business jet program 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity include cash flow from operations  which include advance payments and receivables from customers  borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our bond issuances 
our liquidity requirements and working capital needs depend on a number of factors  including delivery rates and payment terms under our contracts  the level of research and development expenditures related to new programs  capital expenditures  growth and contractions in the business cycle  contributions to our union sponsored benefit plans and interest and principal payments on our indebtedness 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
based on our planned levels of operations and our strong liquidity position  we currently expect that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  inventory growth as discussed below  planned capital investments  research and development expenditures and scheduled debt service payments for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents cash flows the following table provides a summary of our cash flow for the years ended december   december   and december  for the twelve months ended december  december  december  in millions net income adjustments to reconcile net income changes in working capital net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the period cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  operating activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash inflow of million from operating activities  an increase of million compared to a net cash outflow of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to higher net income  the slowing of new program inventory growth on programs other than b which is ramping up production  and a payment received in the fourth quarter of as a result of the memorandum of agreement and settlement agreement between spirit and boeing relating to the b contract 
this overall improvement was partially offset by a decrease in advance payments as increased deliveries of the b liquidated advances previously received  and a decline in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in in  we benefited from a change in accounts payable terms which occurred in the first quarter of our overall trend of inventory growth is driven primarily by our contractually required investments in new programs which include the boeing b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for an increase in inventory in of million  as compared to an increase of million in we expect these programs will continue to drive inventory growth as we incur additional up front costs to produce initial units  which traditionally have a higher cost 
the mature boeing and airbus program inventories decreased million in as compared with a million increase for these contracts in in  inventory balances decreased million on remaining programs  including non program specific inventory  as compared to an increase in inventory balances of million for the same period in the prior year 
as a component of the increase in inventory  the amount related to the b program increased by million in compared to an increase of million in the same period of deferred production balances increased by million in compared to million in the same period of as a result of delivery of sixteen b ship sets in as compared to eleven ship sets in the same period of deferred production per unit also decreased reflecting the decreasing manufacturing cost per unit 
deferred production costs represent the deferral of excess over average costs over the production block 
the revenue we recognized upon delivery of b ship sets in both and did not result in cash receipts  resulting instead in the liquidation of customer advances 
this will continue until cash payments for the b units resume  which is expected to occur 
table of contents prior to the delivery of the th unit 
additionally  increases in inventory related to the b will continue to consume incremental amounts of cash until the cost to build a ship set falls below the ship set price recognized at delivery 
investing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of million from investing activities  an increase in outflow of million  as compared to a net cash outflow of million for the same period in the prior year 
the primary driver in the increased use of cash between periods was the final payment of the long term receivable from boeing in december  which resulted in a cash benefit of million in with no corresponding benefit in during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  software and program tooling  which was million higher than during the same period in the prior year  as the result of set up of our facilities in kinston  north carolina and saint nazaire  france 
financing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash inflow of million from financing activities  an increase in cash flow of million  compared to a net cash inflow of million for the same period in the prior year

spirit repaid million and million of borrowings under its senior secure credit facility using a portion of the bond proceeds in and  respectively 
twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  operating activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of million from operating activities  a decrease of million  as compared to a net cash inflow of million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided from operations in was primarily due to lower net income and recognition of net customer advances and net deferred revenue of million as compared to million of customer advances and deferred revenue received in related to the b and a xwb programs 
while the overall change in inventory balance related to the b program increased by million in compared to an increase of million in  deferred production costs increased by million in and million in as a result of delivery of eleven b ship sets in as compared to three in deferred production costs represent the deferral of excess over average costs over the production block 
the revenue we recognized upon delivery of b ship sets in did not result in cash receipts  resulting instead in the liquidation of customer advances 
this will continue until cash payments for the b units resume  prior to the delivery of the th unit 
additionally  increases in inventory related to the b will continue to consume incremental amounts of cash until the cost to build a ship set falls below the ship set price recognized at delivery 
increased spending on new programs year over year also had an impact of million on inventory 
investing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of million related to investing activities  a million decrease  as compared to a cash outflow of million in the prior year 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  software and program tooling  which was million lower than during the same period in the prior year  partially offset by a slight decrease in boeing payments to spirit attributable to the acquisition of title of various tooling and other capital assets 
the last of these payments were received in december financing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash inflow of million related to financing activities  a million increase  as compared to a million cash inflow in the prior year 
this was due primarily to the receipt of million in net proceeds received from spirit s bond offering in the third quarter of  partially offset by additional deferred financing costs associated with the bond offering 
spirit repaid million of borrowings under its existing senior secured revolving credit facility using a portion of the bond proceeds 
future cash needs and capital spending our primary future cash needs will consist of working capital  debt service  research and development and capital expenditures

we anticipate reaching maximum capacity for certain programs  and are evaluating various plans to relieve capacity constraints for the announced customer production rate increases 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand  from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
tax payments total tax payments  net of refunds  were million in  million in and million in year to year changes are due to changes in legislation and levels and mix of taxable income 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our us pension plan remained fully funded at year end as a result of the plan s asset performance during  we now expect a decrease in non cash pension income in future periods 
our plan investments are broadly diversified and we do not anticipate a near term requirement to make cash contributions to our us pension plan 
we continue to make contributions to our uk pension plan 
our projected contributions to the uk pension plan for are million

tax incentive bonds 
both spirit and the predecessor utilized city of wichita issued industrial revenue bonds irbs to finance self constructed and purchased real and personal property at the wichita site 
the bonds issued in     and mature ten years from issuance while the bonds issued in through mature years after their issuance 
tax benefits associated with irbs include provisions for a ten year complete property tax abatement and a kansas department of revenue sales tax exemption on all irb funded purchases 
spirit and the predecessor purchased these irbs so they are both bondholders and debtor lessee for the property purchased with the irb proceeds 
therefore  we offset the amounts invested and obligations for these bonds on a consolidated basis 
certain predecessor property that was subject to predecessor owned irbs continues to be subject to those irbs 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  the predecessor assigned its leasehold interest in irb funded assets and the related bonds to a special purpose trust beneficially owned by boeing which subleases these assets to spirit 
pursuant to the sublease terms  the special purpose trust will purchase the assets from the city of wichita  terminate the leases between the city and the predecessor  redeem the bonds  and transfer the assets to spirit when these assets cease to qualify for the ten year property tax abatement 
the face value for the bonds subleased from the special purpose trust is approximately million 
in addition  spirit obtained irbs in     and with a million aggregate principal amount 
spirit redeemed million of irbs issued in in we have an incentive agreement with the kansas department of commerce  pursuant to which the kansas development finance authority issued bonds and provided loans to finance eligible projects

pursuant to offset 
table of contents provisions in the underlying debt instruments  there are no principal or interest cash payments associated with the bonds

the million in debt instruments will expire in december credit ratings on october   our corporate credit rating at standard poor s rating services was affirmed at bb and our corporate credit rating at moody s investor service was upgraded to ba from ba our credit ratings are reviewed periodically by the rating agencies listed above 
the credit rating agencies consider many factors when assigning their ratings  such as the global economic environment and its possible impact on our financial performance  including certain financial metrics used by the rating agencies in determining our credit ratings 
accordingly  it is possible the rating agencies could downgrade our credit ratings from their current levels 
this could significantly influence the interest rate of any future debt financings 
a debt security credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or held a security 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases disclosed in the notes to our financial statements included in this annual report  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  tax we establish reserves in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited 
we recognize the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit s progress  case law developments  and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that with a million long term payable  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog as of december   our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft  regional jet  business jet and military equipment deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  was approximately billion 
this is an increase of billion over our corresponding estimate as of the end of reflecting the fact that orders exceeded deliveries in backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing or airbus announced backlog on our supply agreements 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  our expected backlog as of december   may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period 
foreign operations we engage in business in various non us markets 
as of december   we have a foreign subsidiary with one facility in the united kingdom  which serves as a production facility  an assembly facility in malaysia  a worldwide supplier base  and a repair center for the european and middle eastern regions 
we purchase certain components and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers  including airbus  or resold to foreign end users ie  foreign airlines and militaries 
in addition  spirit has built a new assembly facility in saint nazaire  france to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the airbus a xwb commercial aircraft from the facility in kinston  north carolina before they are shipped to airbus 
the new facility is expected to begin operations in spirit is party to a joint venture operation with russian based progresstech ltd

currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 

table of contents sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments countries 
furthermore  the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit s contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars 
spirit europe s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
in some cases  our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
although the raw material industry is experiencing a softening in demand  some specific materials have yet to reflect a corresponding reduction in price 
we expect that raw material market pricing volatility will remain a factor that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities  we are exposed to various market risks that may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
these market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay on our variable rate debt 
other than the interest rate swaps described below  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  the funds in which our pension assets are invested  and trade accounts receivable 
accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers  amounts earned but unbilled  particular estimated contract changes  claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery  and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our net revenues were from sales to boeing 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in liquid short term money market funds 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 
commodity price risks some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are 
table of contents party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing and airbus 
these collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from market volatility across the industry for certain specialized metallic and composite raw materials used in the aerospace industry 
although our supply agreements with boeing and airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing pricing increases for metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium despite softening market demand across the industry 
although the demand pressure has been somewhat eased for certain metallic and composite raw materials  the specialized nature of the materials used in the aerospace industry has prevented a corresponding decrease in prices 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we continue to review a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities
