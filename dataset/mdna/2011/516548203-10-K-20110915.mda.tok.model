fiscal year financial highlights and other information a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fiscal year ended june  are as follows as reported on form k dated june   we substantially completed the independent investigation of certain allegations asserted by a director of lantronix 
for the fiscal year ending june   we had incurred approximately million of expenses related to the investigation and estimate that we could incur an additional  of expenses in the first quarter of fiscal related to activities associated with concluding the investigation 
also reported on form k dated june   the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo resigned and entered into separation agreements with lantronix 
as a result of the separation agreements  we recorded approximately  of expenses as of june   related to severance and benefits that will be paid according to the terms of the respective agreements 
in addition  we will incur approximately  of expenses in the first quarter of fiscal related to consulting services per the terms of the separation agreements 
net revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the overall increase in net revenues was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in our device enablement product lines and a  or  increase in our device management product lines  offset by a  or  decrease in our non core product lines 
during fiscal  we renegotiated agreements with certain distributors as part of an initiative to optimize the sales channel 
these new agreements removed stock rotation and price protection terms  which previously caused the company to recognize revenue on a sell through basis as opposed to upon shipment 
a majority of these customers were redirected to purchase through large lantronix distributors located in their respective regions 
the result of these changes was the recognition of revenue during the second and third fiscal quarters that would have otherwise been deferred to the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
these customers are no longer required to provide sell through reports and the majority of these customers are now buying from other lantronix distributors whose revenue is recognized on a sell through basis by lantronix and not directly through lantronix 
the net impact of these changes to revenue in the current fiscal year is not practically determinable 
it should be noted that the company has not changed its revenue recognition policy as revenue is still recognized on a sell through basis for those customers with stock rotation and price protection terms 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in inventory reserve expenses related to slow moving products and excess materials for end of life products  an increase in warranty expenses as a result of a specific product issue and product mix as a result of certain lower margin products increasing as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  was due to million of expenses related to the investigation   of expenses related to the contested proxy that was settled in november of   of expenses related to the separation of the former ceo and cfo in june of and an increase in personnel related expenses due to the suspension of a company wide furlough program in the equivalent period one year ago and in increase in outside services related to development projects for upcoming product releases 
net loss was million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  net loss for the fiscal year ended june  included million of expenses related to the investigation   of expenses related to the contested proxy that was settled in november of and  of expenses related to the separation of the former cceo and cfo in june of cash and cash equivalents were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  the decrease in cash is mainly due to payments associated with the increase in inventory and payments of expenses related to the contested proxy and investigation 
net accounts receivable were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  annual days sales outstanding dso in receivables were days for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to days for the fiscal year ended june  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by the timing of shipments within a quarter  our collections performance and that a significant portion of our revenues are recognized on a sell through basis upon shipment from distributor inventories rather than as goods are shipped to distributors 
the increase in net accounts receivable was mainly due to renegotiating agreements with certain distributors as part of an initiative to optimize our sales channel as discussed in detail above 
the impact to net accounts receivable was a lower deferred revenue balance which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable 
net inventories were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  annual inventory turns were for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in inventory was due to an increase in safety stock of certain products to ensure the on time fulfillment of customer demand as well as an increase in the sls spider product family inventory as a result of lower than forecasted demand 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we do not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenues and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
when product revenues are recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience  when price reductions are approved  we establish an estimated liability for price protection payable on inventories owned by product resellers 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenues would result 
our products typically carry a one or two year warranty 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenues are recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertainties relative to the collection of former officer notes receivable 
factors considered in determining the level of this reserve include the value of the collateral securing the notes  our ability to effectively enforce collection rights and the ability of the former officers and lantronix directors to honor their obligations 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally three to twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replacement stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance that would be reflected as an income tax benefit at that time 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of our one reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of the reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate  which generally uses valuation techniques based on multiples of revenue for similar companies and the company s market capitalization 
in addition  management may consider the reporting unit s expected future earnings 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating fair value  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment losses 
as of april   the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be million based upon the company s market capitalization compared to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  of million 
as of june  we have million of goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate purchased intangible assets when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of these assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital is used to estimate the fair value of the assets 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenues  the remaining estimated economic lives of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of our purchased intangible assets 
in the event they are lower  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain purchased intangible assets could be required 
as of june   we have approximately  of purchased intangible assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet

the federal statutory rate was for all periods presented 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of our domestic losses recorded without a tax benefit  as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
as a result of our cumulative losses  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the fiscal years ended june  and the following table summarizes our net operating loss nol carryovers june  in thousands federal state our nol carryovers for federal and state income tax purposes begin to expire in fiscal years and  respectively 
at june   our fiscal through fiscal tax years remain open to examination by federal  state  and foreign taxing authorities 
however  we have nols beginning in fiscal which would cause the statute of limitations to remain open for the year in which the nol was incurred 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception through fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock  a term loan and operating activities 
the following table presents details of our working capital and cash june  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents in order of significance  our working capital as of june  decreased  as compared to june  primarily due to i a decrease in cash as a result of payments related to the investigation  proxy contest and inventory and ii an increase in accounts payable as a result of the increase in inventory and the timing of cash payments to vendors 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available from our line of credit will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenue  research and development  expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments  and expenses related to litigation  which could affect our ability to generate additional cash 
if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may need to raise capital by borrowing additional funds through bank loans  selling of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to operate our business
