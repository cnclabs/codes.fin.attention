item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview of performance and company and industry trends 
as the company entered  the economic environment continued to be uncertain  but showed signs of stabilizing 
with this in mind  management established priorities for the company in to address the uncertainties and the opportunities presented by the economy 
these priorities included continuing to strengthen the balance sheet  focusing on core operations that drive revenues and profitability  monetizing non core assets prudently  beginning to invest capital opportunistically but with discipline  and operating the company more simply and efficiently 
the company made progress in each of these focus areas in  and as a result  management believes that the company is better positioned for the challenges of and beyond 
with respect to the balance sheet  management was able to reduce overall leverage primarily through the sale of non core assets 
the company began the year with consolidated debt of million which represented of total market capitalization 
at year end  consolidated debt decreased to million and the debt to total market capitalization ratio decreased to 
the active  but opportunistic  sale of assets was the primary reason for the improvement in leverage 
for the year  the company sold million in assets 
the largest single asset sale was san jose marketcenter  which generated million in gross proceeds 
in addition  the company generated million from the sale of land tracts and ground leased outparcels  million from the sale of for sale multi family units and million from the sale of residential lots 
the company also sold westside parkway for million 
the company also reduced its exposure to near term maturities during by refinancing two consolidated mortgage loans  extending an unconsolidated construction loan and refinancing another unconsolidated mortgage loan 
one of the consolidated mortgage loans was a million mortgage loan on terminus  which was scheduled to mature in the company refinanced this loan by reducing the principal amount to million  reducing the interest rate from a fixed annual rate of to and extending the maturity date to the other consolidated loan was a million mortgage note on meridian mark plaza which was scheduled to mature in september the company refinanced this loan by increasing the principal amount to million  reducing the interest rate from a fixed annual rate of to and extending the maturity date to in addition  the million construction loan in the cf murfreesboro associates venture that was scheduled to mature in july was extended to  and the company replaced a million  mortgage loan at its cp venture five llc joint venture that matured in with a million  mortgage loan that matures in the company also renegotiated its credit facility in in exchange for a reduction in the overall capacity of the facility from million to million and an increase in the spread it pays over libor  the company modified certain financial and operating covenants to  among other things  provide more flexibility in its ability to sell assets 
in  the company also changed its investment in terminus the company reduced its interest in terminus from to  paid its million loan guarantee  committed to invest an additional million into the project and extended the loan from to subsequent to this change  terminus s percent leased increased from at the beginning of to at year end 
with respect to the company s objective of focusing on core operations  the company made progress leasing its vacant space 
in a still challenging leasing environment  the company increased its percent leased at its office properties from at the beginning of the year to at year end 
retail properties percentage leased increased from to when san jose marketcenter is excluded from beginning of year statistics and industrial properties increased from to 
an added benefit from increased retail leasing was a reduction in the company s exposure to co tenancy clauses in various retail leases 
leases subject to co tenancy issues decreased from  square feet at the beginning of the year to  square feet at year 
table of contents end  representing less than of total retail square footage 
this leasing activity also caused rental property revenues less rental property operating expenses to increase million across the company s portfolio of consolidated and joint venture properties in the company expects additional increases in as revenues commence on certain space leased in the company s fee income in remained consistent with that of in spite of the loss of slightly over million square feet of management and or leasing contracts from its third party business 
the loss in the related fees was offset by management and leasing fees from our terminus joint venture and development fees from two new engagements 
in addition to the additional investments the company made in terminus and terminus discussed above  at the end of  the company was able to deploy capital in an attractive investment opportunity 
the company invested million of equity in a joint venture that owns four publix anchored shopping centers in the southeast 
the company s investment capital was used to help its joint venture partner restructure indebtedness on the properties 
in exchange  the company will receive a preference on operating cash flows and cash flows from the sale or refinancing of the properties 
the company was able to accomplish its goals while reducing its overall personnel costs and with more efficient management of expenses 
during  the company reduced its non property personnel by approximately which  combined with expense management activities from  caused non property salary expense to decrease by in the company expects overall general and administrative expenses for to be lower than those of based on these and additional expense management initiatives 
management continues to evaluate all of its general and administrative expenses as the company s business and economic conditions change 
looking into  management expects the company to continue to liquidate its non strategic land  residential lot and industrial holdings to further improve its financial position 
management also believes that the company can continue to lease its vacant office and retail space 
management will continue to search for opportunities to invest in real estate projects  and these investments may take the form of underperforming office or retail projects in need of capital to complete and in need of leasing and asset management expertise to lease and operate efficiently 
there is no guarantee that any of these opportunities will materialize or that the company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities 
critical accounting policies 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as outlined in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  selling multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to its long lived assets  including cost capitalization  depreciation and amortization  and impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  revenue recognition  including residential lot sales  land tract sales  multi family residential unit sales and valuation of receivables  income tax valuation allowances  and accounting for investments in non wholly owned entities 
long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate development 
the company expenses predevelopment costs on a project until the project becomes probable defined as more likely than not that it will be developed 
after management determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with accounting rules 
if the company abandons development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  the company charges all previously capitalized costs to expense 
if this occurs  the company s predevelopment expenses could rise significantly in that period because all capitalized predevelopment costs associated with that project would be 
table of contents charged to expense in the period that this change occurs 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets and earnest money as of december  once a project is deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates or amortizes real estate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating certain indirect project costs to projects under development 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
the company generally amortizes tenant costs over the lease term 
in certain situations  the tenant may not fulfill its commitments under its lease  and the estimated amortization period of those tenant assets could change 
in recent years  some of the company s retail tenants have experienced bankruptcy or have modified the terms of their lease  which resulted in accelerated amortization of tenant costs or a change in the amortization period  thereby directly affecting the current year s net income 
impairment of long lived assets real estate assets 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its real estate assets for impairment indicators that include  but are not limited to  a decline in a property s leasing percentage  a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property  a decline in lease rates or market sales prices  an adverse change in tenants industries or other changes in the market 
if management determines that indicators of impairment are present  management performs a further analysis to determine whether an impairment loss is required 
with the recent decline in the housing market and the overall economic downturn  management determined that indicators of impairment were present on several of the company s real estate assets 
therefore  the company evaluated these assets for recoverability 
these analyses require significant judgment on the part of management 
first  a determination of the intent and ability to hold these assets affects the type of analyses performed 
if an asset is considered to be held for use  as described in accounting guidance  the recoverability of the asset is assessed based on the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  the asset is determined to be impaired  and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the project s fair value 
if an asset is considered to be held for sale  as described in accounting guidance  the asset is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell 
the company performs real estate valuation assessments based on current and future market conditions utilizing assumptions which could differ materially from actual results 
these assumptions are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change 
several examples of these assumptions are enumerated in the next paragraph 
in analyzing the cash flows and fair value of assets with indicators of impairment  management estimates future market rental rates  cash outlays to generate leases  market capitalization rates for residual values and makes various other estimates 
for residential developments  management estimates sales prices  costs to complete development  carry costs and other project level cash flows 
management reviews similar products in the market in which its assets are held and adjusts its hold period  sales volume  pricing and other factors as it deems necessary 
the cyclical nature of the real estate industry  the high levels of existing inventories in the locations of the company s assets  consumer confidence  retailer health  employment levels and additional factors  all enter into management s judgment during this analysis 
in addition  the expected use of the company s assets could change over time as management obtains more information or adjusts its strategy 
in addition  the discount rates utilized to estimate the fair value of assets can vary greatly based on the risk associated with the asset  which normally is affected by the type of project  the stage of its life cycle and the location of the asset 
the fair value of an asset can materially change if the discount rate changes 
the company recorded impairment charges on several of its real estate projects and certain other assets in the last three years 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents management does not believe any of its other assets are impaired as of december   but will continue to monitor the state of the economy  the validity of the estimates utilized in the company s impairment analyses and the anticipated use and hold period of its assets 
impairment of long lived assets investments in joint ventures 
additionally  management performs an impairment analysis of the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures in accordance with accounting rules 
at each reporting period  management reviews its investments in joint ventures for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are present for any of the company s investments in joint ventures  management calculates the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  management must determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  as defined 
if management assesses the impairment to be temporary  the company does not record an impairment charge 
if management concludes that the impairment is other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge 
the company recorded impairment charges for several of its investments in joint ventures in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
management uses considerable judgment in determining whether there are indicators of impairment present and in the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the investment 
management also uses judgment in making the determination as to whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
the company utilizes guidance provided by the sec in making the determination of whether the impairment is temporary 
the guidance indicates that companies consider the length of time that the impairment has existed  the financial condition of the joint venture and the ability and intent of the holder to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in market value 
considerable judgment is required by management to make these determinations 
if management incorrectly concludes that an impairment is temporary  the company s financial statements may not include an impairment charge that would have had an adverse impact on its results of operations 
likewise  if management changes its previous conclusion and determines an impairment to be other than temporary  the company could be required to record a significant impairment charge 
revenue recognition residential lot  for sale multi family and land tract sales 
when selling a lot  multi family unit or land tract  a gross profit percentage is calculated 
these percentages are calculated based on estimated sales prices and the estimated costs of the development 
markets for certain products can change over time as the project is selling  and therefore historical sales prices may not be indicative of the project s prices over its lifetime 
also sales may not occur at a consistent or predictable rate 
therefore  sales price estimates made by management require a high degree of estimation 
in addition  the state of the housing market in some of the areas in which the company operates remain generally depressed  and the severity and duration of this cannot be predicted 
past estimates and assumptions may not have captured the magnitude of this decline 
also included in the estimate of gross profit percentage is the overall cost of the project 
management must estimate the costs to complete the development of the residential or for sale multi family projects or the cost of the land tract improvements 
if the company s estimated lot  unit or land tract sales prices  timing of sales or costs of development  or any of the other underlying assumptions were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the overall profit recognized on these sales 
valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance to record against its receivables 
this review process requires management to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
current economic conditions have affected certain of the company s tenants  which in some cases have led to store closings  lease adjustments  bankruptcies and other changes in the lease terms 
this pattern could continue and future information  which previously has been difficult to predict  can change past judgments regarding collectibility and  additionally  certain receivables currently deemed collectible could become uncollectible 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset 
table of contents ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
the company periodically assesses the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  its experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of joint ventures with varying structures 
management evaluates all of its joint ventures and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in accounting rules 
if the venture is a vie  and if management determines that the company is the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
the company reassesses its conclusions as to whether the entity is a vie and whether consolidation is appropriate as required under the rules 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  management evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
generally  entities under the company s control are consolidated  and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
if the company s judgment as to the existence of a vie  the primary beneficiary of the vie  and the extent of influence and control over a non vie is incorrect  the presentation on the balance sheet and the way the results of operations were reflected could be incorrect 
in addition  the conclusion of whether or not an entity should be consolidated can change as reconsideration events occur 
as time passes from the formation of an entity  the expected results of the entity can vary  which also could change the allocation to the partners 
different conclusions may be reached in the future depending on market conditions  and certain joint ventures not previously consolidated could become consolidated entities and vice versa 
the company recognizes on its consolidated balance sheets the partner s share of non wholly owned entities which the company consolidates 
the noncontrolling partner s share of current operations is reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company has several joint venture agreements that contain provisions requiring the company to purchase the noncontrolling interest at fair value upon demand or at a future date 
these noncontrolling interests with redemption features  or redeemable noncontrolling interests  are reflected at fair value in a separate line item on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company records the difference between cost and fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to equity as changes in fair value occur 
contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
this account is subsequently adjusted for the company s share of income or loss from unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as contributions and distributions to and from the entities 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets on the joint venture s balance sheet is adjusted as the related underlying assets are depreciated  amortized or sold 
discussion of new accounting pronouncement 
the company adopted new guidelines effective january   which modified how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and additional disclosures about a company s involvement in vies  including any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement  is required 
these new guidelines did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
the company s financial results have historically been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  real estate developments 
these types of transactions and developments do not necessarily recur 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results

impairment loss 
during  and  the company recorded the following impairment losses in thousands 
table of contents handy road n 
market related note receivable terminus place company airplane handy road  a consolidated joint venture that holds undeveloped land in atlanta  georgia  has a mortgage loan that is due in march the company has been holding this land for future development or sale 
in connection with the maturing mortgage loan  the company evaluated several alternatives with respect to this project and determined that it was unlikely to either seek an extension of the loan or to repay the loan in order to hold the land for future investment or development opportunities 
therefore  a conveyance of the property to the bank represents the most likely scenario for this project 
given this change in intent  the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million to record the land at its fair value  less costs to sell 
north market  a for sale multi family residential project in asheville  north carolina  was acquired by the company in july in satisfaction of a note receivable 
upon acquisition  the company recorded a million impairment loss which equaled the difference between the fair value of the project and the sum of the book value of the note receivable plus a construction loan on the project that the company paid 
in  the company recorded an additional impairment on the project of  as it determined the fair value of the project had declined further since its acquisition 
at december   there was approximately  square feet of commercial space available for sale with a carrying amount of  terminus place is a for sale multi family residential project in atlanta  georgia 
the company substantially completed the development in late  and at that point it was determined to be held for sale in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
the company recorded a million impairment loss at substantial completion to record the project at the company s estimate of fair value 
in  market conditions for for sale multi family residential projects deteriorated further  and the company recorded an additional impairment loss of million 
at december   seven units with a carrying amount of approximately million remain unclosed at this project and are included in multi family units held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in  the company sold its airplane at an amount lower than its cost basis  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
most of the company s real estate assets are considered to be held for use pursuant to the accounting rules 
if management s intent changes on any of these assets  the company may be required to record significant impairment charges in future periods 
changes that could cause these impairment losses include a decision by the company to sell the asset rather than hold for long term investment or development purposes  or changes in management s estimates of future cash flows from the assets that cause the future undiscounted cash flows to be less than the asset s carrying amount 
given the uncertainties with the economic environment and the amount of the company s land and residential lot holdings  management cannot predict whether or not the company will incur impairment losses in the future  and if impairment losses are recorded  management cannot predict the magnitude of such losses 
other expense

funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income loss available to common stockholders for the company 
the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates operating performance in part based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and key employees
