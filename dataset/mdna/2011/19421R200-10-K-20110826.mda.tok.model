item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business collectors universe  inc we  us management our or the company provides authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  trading cards  event tickets  autographs  sports and historical memorabilia and stamps 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles by providing dealers and collectors with a high level of assurance as to the authenticity and quality of the collectibles they seek to buy or sell  thereby enhancing their marketability and providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell such collectibles 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from other related services which consist of i the sale of advertising on our websites  ii the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in our publications and on our website  iii the sale of membership subscriptions in our collectors club  which is designed primarily to attract interest in high value collectibles among new collectors  iv the sale of subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins and to our coinfacts website  which offers a comprehensive one stop source for historical us numismatic information and value added content  and v the management and operation of collectibles trade shows and conventions 
we also generate revenues from sales of our collectibles inventory  which is primarily comprised of collectible coins that we have purchased under our coin grading warranty program  however  such product sales are neither the focus nor an integral part of our on going revenue generating activities 
factors that can affect operating results and our financial position factors that can affect our revenue 
our authentication and grading fees accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in each of the three years ended june  the amounts of those fees are primarily driven by the volume and mix of coin and collectibles sales and purchase transactions by collectibles dealers and collectors  because our collectibles authentication and grading services generally facilitate sales and purchases of coins and other high value collectibles by providing dealers and collectors with a high level of assurance as to the authenticity and quality of the collectibles they seek to sell or buy 
consequently  dealers and collectors most often submit coins and other collectibles to us for authentication and grading at those times when they are in the market to sell or buy coins and other high value collectibles that we authenticate and grade 
in addition  our coin authentication and grading revenues are impacted by the level of modern coin submissions  which can be volatile  primarily depending on the timing and size of modern coin marketing programs by the united states mint and by customers or dealers who specialize in sales of such coins 
the amounts of our authentication and grading revenues are affected by i the volume and mix of authentication and grading submissions among coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and other collectibles on the other hand  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable by dealers than modern coins and trading cards  and iv as discussed above  the timing of marketing programs for modern coins 
our revenues are also affected by the volume of coin authentication and grading submissions we receive at collectibles trade shows where we provide on site authentication and grading services to show attendees  who typically request higher priced same day turnaround for the coins they submit to us for authentication and grading at those shows 
the volume of trade show submissions varies from period to period depending upon a number of factors  including the number and the timing of the shows in each period and the volume of collectible coins that are bought and sold at those shows by dealers and collectors 
in addition  the number of such submissions and  therefore  the revenues and gross profit margin we generate from the authentication and grading of coins at trade shows can be impacted by short term changes in the prices of gold that sometimes occur around the time of the shows  because gold prices can affect the willingness of dealers and collectors to sell and purchase coins at the shows 
five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted  in the aggregate  for approximately of our total net revenues in the year ended june  as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a significant decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  could cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our results of operations 
the following table provides information regarding the respective numbers of coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that we authenticated or graded in the fiscal years ended june    and units processed coins trading cards autographs stamps total the following table sets forth the estimated values at which our customers insured the coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that they submitted to us for grading or authentication declared values s coins trading cards autographs stamps total factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins we earn on collectibles authentication and grading submissions are impacted by much the same factors that impact our revenues  as the average service fee and the resulting gross profit margin earned is affected by i the volume and mix of those submissions among coins  trading cards and other collectibles  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our costs of sales are fixed in nature in the short term  our gross profit margin is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles that we authenticate and grade in any period 
impact of economic conditions on our financial performance 
as discussed above  our operating results are affected by the volume of collectibles transactions by collectibles dealers and collectors which  in turn  is primarily affected by i the disposable income available to collectors and their confidence about future economic conditions  because high value collectibles are generally viewed as luxury goods and are purchased with disposable income  ii the cash flows generated by collectibles dealers and their confidence about future economic conditions  which affect their willingness and the ability of such dealers to purchase collectibles for resale  iii the availability and cost of borrowings because collectibles dealers often rely on borrowings to fund their purchases of collectibles  iv prevailing and anticipated rates of inflation and the strength or weakness of the us dollar  because the threat of increased inflation or concerns about the weakening of the us dollar often lead investors and consumers to purchase gold and silver coins as a hedge against inflation or reductions in the purchasing power of the us currency  and v the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets  which can affect the level of purchases and sales of collectible coins  because investors and consumers will often increase their purchases of hard assets  including gold coins if they believe that the market prices of hard assets will increase 
as a result  the volume of collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our authentication and grading services  generally increase during periods characterized by economic growth  the availability of lower cost borrowings  or increases in inflation or in gold prices or a weakening of the us dollar 
by contrast  collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our services generally decline during periods characterized by economic downturns or recessions  declines in consumer and business confidence  an absence of inflationary pressure  or declines in the market prices of gold 
however  these conditions can sometimes counteract each other as it is not uncommon  for example  for investors to shift funds from gold to other investments during periods of economic growth and growing consumer and business confidence 
despite the continued uncertainties with respect to the strength and the sustainability of the economic recovery  our revenues excluding product revenues in the current fiscal year increased by approximately  compared to the same period of the prior year  and included a increase in revenue from the authentication and grading of collectible coins  which is our largest grading and authentication market 
we believe those increases reflect the continued high prices of gold and concerns about inflation and the continued weakness of the us dollar among collectors and investors  as well as customer specific marketing initiatives that drive the grading of modern coins 
our revenues are discussed in more detail below under the caption results of operations net revenues 
factors that can affect our financial position 
a substantial number of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
as a result  historically  we have been able to rely on internally generated cash and have never incurred borrowings to fund our continuing operations 
we currently expect that internally generated cash flows and current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations at least through the end of fiscal in addition to the day to day operating performance of our business  our overall financial position can also be affected by the company s capital raising or stock buyback activities  the dividend policy adopted by the board of directors from time to time  and the company s decisions to invest in and to fund the acquisition of businesses 
in july  the company used approximately million of available cash to purchase  shares of our common stock in a dutch auction tender offer  and in fiscal  the board of directors reinstated the payment of dividends such that we paid approximately million and million in cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  our financial position is impacted by the company s tax position as the company may only be required to pay minimum taxes  when it has net operating losses and other tax attributes available to offset taxable income 
however  once those tax losses or other tax attributes have been fully utilized  the company will then be required to pay taxes at an estimated annual effective tax rate of  as adjusted for timing differences 
trends and challenges in and opportunities for our businesses in response to the economic recession and the credit crisis that adversely impacted the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us during fiscal  we implemented a cost reduction program to reduce our costs of revenue and our operating expenses to bring those costs and expenses more in line with our revenues and  thereby  increase our gross profits and operating income 
during fiscal and  that program  combined with the increase in our coin authentication and grading revenues  enabled us to realize increased gross profit margin and operating income when operating income is adjusted for a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal  and cash flows from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth comparative financial data for the years ended june  and year ended june  year ended june  amount percent of revenues amount percent of revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses impairment losses operating income interest income  net other expense income  net income before benefit provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income net income loss per diluted share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income in fiscal  pretax income decreased by  compared to fiscal excluding the impairment loss in fiscal  pre tax income would have increased by  and  compared to fiscal due primarily to increases of in revenues in the current year 
the increase in total revenues was primarily attributable to increases in authentication and grading fees in our coin business  comprising increases in the modern  vintage and world coins graded and authenticated 
however  due to the recognition of an income tax provision of  representing a tax rate of approximately in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal  income from continuing operations decreased in fiscal the substantially higher effective tax provision in fiscal was due to the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets at june  cash payments for income taxes continued to be minimal in fiscal these  as well as other factors affecting out operating results are described in more detail below 
see factors that can affect our operating results and financial condition critical accounting policies and estimates long lived assets other than goodwill  goodwill and income taxes  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances and results of operations below 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact  eg  our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances on which our judgments or estimates are based  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves  allowances  charges or losses to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets  such as  for example  accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves  allowances  charges or losses are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for their full effects to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves  allowances  charges or losses for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
in prior years  we acquired certain businesses and assets some of which are now classified as part of discontinued operations  as we have closed  or disposed of such assets  and in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate amounts paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see goodwill below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives see long lived assets other than goodwill below 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to ongoing evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the business acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
if it is determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such assets has declined below their carrying values  it would become necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge is recognized 
we also estimate losses associated with the disposal of a business or the sale of assets when a decision has been made to dispose of or discontinue such business or sell such assets 
in accordance with gaap  assets available for sale are stated at the lower of costs or their net realizable value 
in addition  the estimated fair value of liabilities for employee terminations is recognized as of the date such terminations are communicated to the affected employees and for lease obligations as of the date we cease using the real property or equipment subject to the lease 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves  allowances  charges or losses for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the customer  net of any taxes collected 
due to the insignificant delay between the completion of our grading and authentication services and the shipment of the collectible or high value asset back to the customer  the time of shipment corresponds to the completion of our services 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until the collectibles have been authenticated and graded and shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
a portion of our net revenues is comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for memberships in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members to access our on line and printed publications and  sometimes also to receive vouchers for free grading services from us 
we record revenue for this multi element service arrangement by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase 
we review this estimate at least semi annually by recalculating the percentage based on the relative values of the various elements in the collectors club offering and determining the appropriate percentage to attribute to the grading services and the remaining subscription 
our estimates have proven to be consistently around on an ongoing basis 
the balance of the membership fee is recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
with respect to our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of each of its collectibles conventions or trade shows in the fiscal period in which the convention or show takes place  and for pcgs s coinfacts subscription revenues  we recognize revenue over the subscription period 
we recognize the revenue from the sale of products when it is shipped to the customer and all the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
such products consist primarily of collectible coins that we purchase pursuant to our coin authentication and grading warranty program and those product sales are not considered an integral part of our ongoing revenue generating activities 
accrual for losses on facility leases 
as a result of the discontinuance of and our exit from the jewelry authentication and grading businesses in fiscal  we ceased the occupancy of facilities we had leased for their operations 
we retained a commercial real estate broker to sublease those facilities on our behalf 
through june   we established estimated loss accruals of  for liabilities under those leases 
the amount of those lease accruals was determined based on estimates on a discounted basis of i prevailing sublease rates in the real estate market where those facilities are located  as compared to our rental obligations under those leases  ii the time we expected it would take to sublet those facilities  and iii other direct costs associated with the leases 
in fiscal  the company continued to re evaluate its loss accruals for the lease obligations and recognized an additional accrual of  in the second quarter of fiscal in may  the company entered into agreements to reduce its lease obligations  whereby one of the spaces was sublet to a third party  and the second facility was returned to the landlord and the lease terminated with only a financial obligation remaining 
as a result of these agreements  and in accordance with gaap  the company measured the change in cash flows using the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the initial liabilities and the cumulative effect of the change of approximately  resulting from the revision  was recognized as a reduction to the liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of those changes  the payment of lease obligations and the recognition of accretion expense  the remaining obligations at june  were approximately  we will continue to review and  if necessary  make adjustments to these accruals on a quarterly basis 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers who submit collectibles to us for authentication and grading on an ongoing basis 
until the second quarter of fiscal  we also made advances to selected coin dealers evidenced by notes receivable pursuant to a dealer financing program  which have been substantially repaid or written down to zero at june  we regularly review our accounts receivable  estimate the amounts of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accounts and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors to pay their accounts receivable balances 
each quarter we review our estimates of uncollectible amounts and  if necessary  adjust the allowance to take account of changes in economic or other conditions or trends that we believe will have an adverse effect on the ability of any of the account debtors to pay their accounts in full 
since the allowance is increased by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause an increase in such expenses 
at june  and allowances for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively 
inventory valuation reserves 
our collectibles inventories  which consist primarily of collectible coins that we have purchased pursuant to our coin warranty program  are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories below their carrying values 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness and special features of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory and the volatility in the prices of precious metals  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
as a result  we review the market values of the collectibles in our inventory on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to the valuation reserve that we believe are necessary or prudent based on our judgments regarding these matters 
in the event that a collectible is sold for a price below its carrying value  we record a charge to operating income 
at june  and  collectibles coin inventories were  and  and inventory reserves were  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if we liquidate collectible coins at amounts below their carrying value  we may incur losses in excess of our recorded inventory reserves 
the company also maintains inventories of plastic holders and other related consumables used in our grading processes 
such consumable inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  trading cards and stamps that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if such a collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible for a price equal to the value of collectible at its original grade  or  at the customer s option  pay the difference between the value of the collectible at its original grade as compared with the value at its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded the item or if we otherwise determine that the collectible had been altered after we had authenticated and graded it 
if we purchase an item under a warranty claim  we recognize the difference in the value of the item at its original grade and its re graded estimated value as a reduction in our warranty reserve 
we include the purchased item in our inventory at the estimated re graded value of the collectible  which will be lower than the price we paid to purchase the item 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience  and we monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserve on an ongoing basis 
there also are a number of factors that can cause the estimated values of the collectibles purchased under our warranty program to change over time and  as a result  we review the market values of those collectibles see inventory valuation reserves above 
however  once we have classified such items as inventory and they have been held in inventory beyond the end of the fiscal quarter in which we purchased them  we classify any gains or losses on the subsequent disposal of such items as part of the gain or loss on product sales and not as an adjustment to our warranty reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for activity in our warranty reserves 
goodwill 
we test the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually on their respective acquisition anniversary dates  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are determined to exist 
when testing for impairment  we apply a discounted cash flow model or an income approach in determining a fair value that is used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a total basis  which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then there is the possibility of goodwill impairment and further testing and re measurement of goodwill is required 
during the first quarter ended september   we completed the annual goodwill impairment evaluations with respect to the goodwill acquired in our fiscal year purchases of cce and coinfacts and the fiscal year acquisition of our expos business  and determined that the carrying values of the acquired goodwill of these respective businesses were not impaired 
the fair value of the cce and coinfacts reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying value  and the risks of impairment in those businesses are minor 
as discussed in previous filings  at september   the fair value of our expos business was close to its carrying value 
management applied sensitivity analysis to our significant assumptions in concluding that no impairment existed at september  at june   we reviewed the performance of expos for fiscal and our expectations for that business in future periods 
in fiscal  the downward trend in revenues continued despite our earlier expectations that revenues would stabilize and grow in future years 
furthermore  due to continued difficulties experienced in retaining customer participation at the shows  we expect continued attrition in future periods 
this overall downward trend in revenues  combined with the follow on effect on specific customer revenue assumptions in the outer year of the forecast period  the impact on the terminal value of the expos business due to a declining revenue base and an increase in the discount rate applicable to expos from to due to a higher equity risk premium  small stock risk premiums and an increase in the risk free rate  led management to conclude that the expos business was impaired at june  therefore  the company recognized impairment losses related to goodwill of  in fiscal  which combined with impairment losses related to intangible assets see long lived assets other than goodwill  resulted in total impairment losses of  in fiscal with respect to our discontinued jewelry businesses  in the year ended june   we recognized impairment losses for their full carrying cost to the goodwill of  which  when combined with impairment losses  related to other indefinite lived intangible assets of those businesses totaling  and these impairment losses have been classified as part of discontinued operations for the year ended june  long lived assets other than goodwill 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets other than goodwill  including certain identifiable intangibles  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definite lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition in order to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
based on such reviews at june   we determined that impairment losses had occurred with respect to certain long lived assets of our expos business  and we therefore recognized impairment losses of  for intangible assets in fiscal  comprising a loss of  for the expos trade name and  for the customer database 
see goodwill above 
in addition  in fiscal  we reviewed the long lived assets of our continuing businesses and concluded that certain capitalized software used in our autograph business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of  for such capitalized software in our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  as part of our jewelry discontinued operations  we recognized impairment losses on our identifiable tangible and intangible assets in those businesses totaling  in fiscal  which have been classified as part of the loss on discontinued operations 
see goodwill above 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date of an award  based on its estimated fair value  and is recognized as expense over the employee or non employee director s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
however  if the vesting of a stock based compensation award is subject to satisfaction of a performance requirement or condition  the stock based compensation expense is recognized if  and when  management determines that the achievement of the performance requirement or condition and therefore the vesting of the award has become probable 
in the event that stock based compensation is recognized on the basis that the performance condition is probable  and management subsequently determines that the performance condition is not met  then all expense previously recognized with respect to the performance condition would be reversed 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for service based stock option awards using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
in addition  we recognize and report stock based compensation expense  net of a forfeiture rate with respect to outstanding awards that we expect will occur over their respective vesting periods  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect the likelihood of forfeiture 
we monitor the forfeiture rate closely to ensure that all stock awards that vest are fully expensed over their respective vesting periods using the straight line attribution method 
no options were granted in through  and substantially all options granted were fully vested as of june  service based stock awards that are granted to members of our board of directors on an annual basis and to certain members of senior management are recognized as stock based compensation over the requisite service period 
fiscal restricted stock awards 
on july   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a management incentive compensation program for the fiscal year ending june  the stock incentive program 
under the terms of that program  certain executive officers and management employees participants were awarded  restricted shares 
retention by each participant of the restricted shares is subject to satisfaction of certain vesting requirements and  if a vesting requirement that applies to any of the shares is not satisfied  those shares will be forfeited and cancelled 
the vesting requirements of the stock incentive program are as follows service based vesting requirement 
the vesting of of the restricted shares the service based shares awarded was made contingent on the participant s continued service with the company  whereby of the service based shares vested on june  and the remaining will vest on june  performance based vesting requirement 
the vesting of the other fifty percent of the restricted shares awarded to each of these participants the performance based shares was made contingent on the company s achievement of a financial performance goal for fiscal if that goal was not achieved  all of these performance based shares would have been forfeited and cancelled 
on the other hand  if the company achieved that fiscal financial performance goal  then i of the performance based shares would become vested when it was determined that the performance goal was achieved  provided that the participant was still in the company s service at the end of fiscal  ii another of the performance based shares would become vested on june   provided the participant continued in the company s service at that time  and iii the final of the performance based shares would become vested on june   provided the participant continued in the company s service at that time  subject to acceleration of such vesting if a participant s service with the company is terminated without cause or if a change of control occurs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  management determined that achieving the performance condition for fiscal was probable and began recognizing stock based compensation for the performance based shares 
in august  it was definitively determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors that the company had achieved the financial performance goal for  and as a result  of the performance based shares vested at that time 
fiscal restricted stock awards 
in august  the compensation committee of the board of directors definitively determined that the company had achieved the financial performance goal for fiscal  and one third of the fiscal performance shares vested 
as a result  stock based compensation on the remaining unvested shares granted is being recognized over the remaining service period through june  dependent on the continued service of the participant 
the company recognized total stock based compensation related to options and restricted shares of   and  for fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
capitalized software 
in fiscal years  and  we capitalized  for continuing operations  approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects 
gaap requires that certain software development costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software  which we have estimated at three years 
on the other hand  planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase of a software development project are recognized as expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine whether those values are impaired and  if necessary  we record an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that an impairment has occurred 
based on such an evaluation  we concluded that as of june  certain capitalized software used in our autograph and memorabilia authentication and grading business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of  in our continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended june  see long lived assets other than goodwill above 
no impairment was recognized in fiscal or fiscal income taxes  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
we account for income taxes in accordance with gaap  which requires the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns or uncertain tax positions 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  gaap requires that we evaluate the probability of realizing the future income tax benefits comprising that asset based on a number of factors  which include projections of future taxable income and the nature of the tax benefits and the respective expiration dates of tax credits and net operating losses 
through june   due to the length of time and the extent of the taxable income required to fully realize our deferred tax assets  we had recorded valuation allowances against all our deferred assets 
at june   due to i the improvement  that began in the second half of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal  in the operating performance and results of our continuing businesses  and ii management s expectations that such improved operating performance would continue in future periods  we concluded that it had become more likely than not  that we would be able to realize all of our remaining deferred tax assets 
as a result  the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were released at june  of this tax benefit of approximately million  approximately million was utilized to offset current fiscal taxable income  and the balance of million was recognized as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations and as deferred tax assets at june  in fiscal  the company recognized income tax provisions of million based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 
at june   the company has not recorded a deferred tax asset for the excess tax basis over the book basis of their investment in a subsidiary as there are uncertainties as to when the basis difference will reverse

fiscal vs 
for fiscal  our total net service revenues increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  and comprised increases of  or  in grading and authentication fees and  or  in other related services 
the increased authentication and grading fees of  in fiscal  was attributable to i increased coin authentication and grading fees of  or  and ii increased psa dna autograph authentication and grading fees of  or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of  or and  or in our sportcards and stamp authentication and grading fees  respectively 
the increase in fees generated from coins authenticated and graded of in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects the mix of fees earned from shows  vintage  modern coins and world coins including france grading in the respective periods 
our modern coin grading and authentication fees increased by approximately  or to record levels  reflecting marketing programs by the us mint and by our customers and dealers in the second half of the year 
world coin authentication and grading revenues grew by approximately  or  reflecting increased submissions of world coins  including grading at our paris  france facility 
vintage authentication and grading fees increased by approximately  or 
show authentication and grading revenues decreased by approximately  or  reflecting lower average grading fees earned per show in fiscal as discussed under factors that can affect our revenues and gross profit margin  the level of modern coins and trade show revenues can be volatile  and therefore it is uncertain what level of growth in those revenues  if any  will be achieved in future quarters 
in addition  the increase in our authentication and grading fees earned  reflects increased submissions of world coins from overseas  particularly asia  and fiscal represented our first year of authentication and grading at our paris  france facility 
it is  therefore  uncertain whether the increased fees earned from the authentication and grading of world coins can continue to grow at levels or whether we can expect continued future growth 
however  management plan to continue to focus attention on world coins as a growth opportunity 
due to the strong performance of our coin authentication and grading business relative to our other businesses in fiscal  our coin business represented approximately of total revenues  compared to of total revenues in fiscal year  thereby  reflecting the continued importance of our coin authentication and grading business to our overall financial performance 
the increases in other related services of  in fiscal included increased product sales of  web based subscriptions  including cce of  advertising revenues of  and collector club membership revenues of  partially offset by a reduction in the revenues of our expos collectibles trade show convention business and our cfc dealer financing business  which we have wound down 
fiscal vs 
for fiscal  net revenues increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was attributable to a  or  increase in authentication and grading fees and a small reduction in revenues from other related services related to product sales 
the increased authentication and grading fees for fiscal included increased coins authentication and grading fees of  or  partially offset by reductions of  or  in revenues from our trading cards and autographs businesses and  or  in stamps 
the increase in coin authentication and grading fees of  for fiscal was due primarily to modern coin grading revenue increases of approximately  or  over the corresponding periods in fiscal also contributing to the coin increase in fiscal  was revenues from authentication and grading of coins at collectible trade shows which increased by approximately  or  over the prior fiscal year  due primarily to an increase in the number of shows attended in those periods 
revenues from the authentication and grading of vintage coins were substantially unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
the costs of authentication and grading revenues consist primarily of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit card fees  warranty expense  occupancy  security and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services 
cost of revenues also includes printing  other direct costs of the revenues generated by our other non grading related services and the costs of product revenues which represent the carrying value of the inventory of products  which are primarily collectible coins that we sold and any inventory related reserves  considered necessary

during fiscal  our quarterly gross profit margin varied between in our second quarter  which is typically our lowest quarter of the year due to the holidays in that period and 
in addition  our gross profit margin may increase or decrease in certain periods depending upon the number of collectibles authenticated and graded in the period due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of our direct costs  although there can be offsetting charges in certain of our variable direct costs depending upon the mix of revenues in the period 
the gross profit margin for our expos business declined in fiscal  reflecting lower revenues and slightly higher direct costs as we attempted to offset declines in revenues in that business 
fiscal vs 
our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal that increase primarily reflects i an increase of in fiscal in coin related revenues on which we earn a higher gross profit margin  ii lower direct costs  both in dollars and percentage terms  as a result of our cost reduction programs and increased operational efficiencies  and iii a reduction of  in stock based compensation expense in fiscal as a result of awards granted in periods prior to fiscal that became fully vested in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit margin on a quarterly basis varied between and

fiscal vs 
the  increase in selling and marketing expenses in the fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to increased incentive compensation costs due to the increase in coin authentication and grading submissions and higher costs incurred in connection with on site grading at trade shows due primarily to an increase in the number of trade shows at which we participated in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are comprised primarily of compensation paid to general and administrative personnel  including executive management  finance and accounting personnel and information technology personnel  facilities management costs  depreciation  amortization and other miscellaneous expenses

due to the continued low interest rates prevailing in both fiscal and  interest income  net  was  compared with  in fiscal vs 
interest income  net was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to i a shift  during fiscal  of our cash and cash equivalent balances into money market investments  ii a decrease in our average cash balances in fiscal  compared to  due to the use of a portion of our available cash to fund the buyback of common stock in our dutch auction tender offer and the payment of increased dividends to stockholders in fiscal  iii cash used in the operating activities of our discontinued operations  and iv lower prevailing interest rates as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board

quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited selected quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent fiscal periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods  because collectibles commerce generally decreases during the holiday season 
our collectibles trade show business has added to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles trade shows it conducts 
as a general matter  the revenues of this business are significantly higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of our fiscal years  compared to the second quarter  because the long beach collectibles shows the larger of the two trade shows that it conducts take place during the first  third and fourth quarters  while the smaller santa clara collectibles shows take place in the second and fourth quarters of the year

in addition  changes in deferred tax balances and the timing of income taxes receivables and payables impact our cash flows from continuing operating activities  although the level of such tax balances can be affected by the activities of our discontinued operations  because all tax balances whether as a result of continuing or discontinued operations are accounted for as part of continuing operations

with the exception of these lease obligations for continuing and discontinued operations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt or capital lease or purchase obligations 
dividends 
during the quarter ended september   we paid quarterly cash dividends of per common share 
subsequent to the payment of the first quarter s dividend in september  the board of directors determined that  due to adverse market and economic conditions  including the liquidity crisis in the united states  the prudent course of action would be  and the board of directors voted  to suspend the future payment of cash dividends in order to preserve the company s cash resources to support the continued implementation of the company s strategic plan and the growth of its business 
at the same time  the board of directors approved a one time stock dividend on the company s outstanding shares 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved the resumption of the payment of dividends at per share per quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the dividend was increased to per share per quarter  and in the second quarter of fiscal  the board of directors increased the payments of dividends to per share per quarter

in december  our board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized up to  of stock repurchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities exchange commission sec rules  when opportunities to make such repurchases  at attractive prices  become available 
during the fiscal year ended june   we repurchased a total of  of our common stock under this program for aggregate purchase prices of approximately  there were no repurchases in fiscal and we continue to have a total of million available for share purchases under the share buyback program 
future uses and sources of cash 
we plan to use our cash resources  consisting of available cash and cash equivalent balances  together with internally generated cash flows  to i introduce new collectibles related services for our customers  ii fund working capital requirements  iii fund acquisitions  iv fund obligations associated with our discontinued businesses  and v fund the payment of dividends and for other general corporate purposes 
in addition  because we expect that our continuing operations will generate positive cash flow in the future  we plan to consider other uses for our available cash that we believe will enhance stockholder value  which could include additional buybacks of shares 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings and we may issue additional shares of our stock to finance the growth of our collectibles businesses 
however  due to the continued slow recovery and the tight credit policy by banks in the united states  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such borrowings or generate additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued amended fair value disclosure guidance 
the new guidance requires disclosure of transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements including a description of the reasons for the transfer where significant and disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements  including information on a gross basis regarding purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
amendments to existing guidance were also made regarding classes of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the company will adopt this guidance effective july  management does not expect the adoption of these standards to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring public companies that enter into material business combination  and present comparative financial statements  to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this amendment is effective for the company for the annual reporting period beginning july  management does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued amended fair value disclosure guidance 
the new guidance requires additional disclosures about the sensitivity of a fair value measurement categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy to changes in unobservable inputs and any relationships between those unobservable inputs 
additional requirements of the amendment include the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position  but for which fair value is required to be disclosed 
the company will adopt this guidance on january  management does not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb  as result of a joint project with the international accounting standards board to improve the quality of and comparability of financial information for users  published a proposal that would change the accounting and financial reporting for both lessee and lessor as described under current guidance 
the proposal would effectively eliminate off balance sheet accounting for most of the operating leases of lessees and would apply one of two methods to lease accounting for lessors  depending on whether the lessor retains exposure to significant risks or benefits of the underlying assets 
the date of issuance of the final standards by the fasb and the effective date are to be determined 
management believes that the final standards  if issued in substantially the same form as the published proposal  would have a material effect on the presentation of its consolidated financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
due to the cash and cash equivalent balances that we maintain  we are exposed to risk of changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  primarily invested in money market accounts 
reductions in short term interest rates could result in reductions in the amount of income we are able to generate on available cash 
however  any adverse impact on our operating results of reductions in interest rates is not expected to be material 
we do not engage in any activities that would expose us to significant foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risks  as the cash balances we maintain overseas for our paris  france office are not material
