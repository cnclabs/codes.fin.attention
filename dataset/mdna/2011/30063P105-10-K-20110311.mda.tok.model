item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer 
we have exclusive intellectual property protecting our non invasive  molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal cancer 
our primary goal is to become the market leader for a patient friendly diagnostic screening product for the early detection of colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our strategic roadmap to achieve this goal includes the following key components develop and refine our non invasive cologuard stool based sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening test  advance our product through us food and drug administration fda clinical trials  and commercialize an fda cleared product that detects colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our current focus is on the commercial development of and seeking us food and drug administration clearance or approval for our cologuard test 
we also are in the process of developing our strategy for the ultimate commercialization of our cologuard test 
we believe obtaining fda clearance or approval is critical to building broad demand and successful commercialization for our sdna colorectal cancer screening technologies 
as part of our product development efforts  product performance  throughput and cost are among the elements that will need to be addressed in the design and development of a commercial product based on our technology 
our cologuard test is designed to detect pre cancerous lesions or polyps  and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer 
pre cancerous polyps are present in approximately percent of the population over years of age in the united states 
we are designing our cologuard test with a goal of detecting both pre cancers and cancers 
the target sensitivity rate for cancer is equal to or greater than percent at a specificity of percent 
on october  we announced the results of a validation study involving a total of  stool samples 
in this study  the current version of our cologuard test was able to detect cancers at or above this target sensitivity rate and we were also able to demonstrate strong pre cancer detection 
we are in the process of developing our strategy for the ultimate commercialization of our cologuard test 
it is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable  yet least prevented cancers 
colorectal cancer typically takes up to years to progress from a pre cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death 
however  it is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states  killing almost  people each year 
there is a significant unmet clinical need related to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer 
approximately percent of those who should be screened for colorectal cancer are not screened according to current guidelines 
poor compliance has meant that nearly two thirds of colon cancer diagnoses are made in the disease late stages 
the five year survival rates for stages and are percent and percent  respectively 
our cologuard test can detect pre cancers and cancers early  and is expected to be a powerful  preventive tool 
by detecting pre cancers and cancers early with our test  affected patients can be referred to colonoscopy  during which the polyp or lesion can be removed 
the sdna screening model 
table of contents has the potential to significantly reduce colorectal cancer deaths 
the earlier the pre cancer or cancer can be detected  the greater the reduction in mortality 
the benefits of sdna based screening are clear 
it detects both pre cancers and cancers 
the target sensitivity for cancer is equal to or greater than percent at a specificity of percent 
sdna based screening is non invasive and requires no bowel preparation or dietary restriction like other methods 
the sample for sdna based screening can be collected easily at home and mailed to the appropriate laboratory  where the testing would be conducted 
sdna based screening also is affordable  particularly relative to colonoscopy 
the competitive landscape is favorable to sdna based screening 
all of the colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity  poor compliance and cost 
colonoscopy is uncomfortable and expensive 
a recent study shows that seven out of people age and older who have been told they should get a colonoscopy still have not had the test primarily due to fears 
fecal blood testing suffers from poor sensitivity  including percent detection rates for cancer and percent detection rates for pre cancers  and poor compliance 
blood based dna testing also is disadvantaged by its low sensitivity 
data from a clinical trial of one blood based test was released in early it demonstrated only percent sensitivity across all stages of cancer  with little sensitivity for pre cancer 
the competitive advantages of sdna based screening provide a significant market opportunity 
assuming a percent test adoption rate and a three year screening interval  we estimate the potential us market for sdna screening to be billion  and the total available us market to be more than billion 
our intellectual property portfolio positions us to be the leading player to develop and market tests for the detection of colorectal cancer from stool samples 
our portfolio of issued and pending patents broadly protects our position from competitors and yields freedom to operate in this market 
we have intellectual property pertaining to sample type  sample preparation  sample preservation  biomarkers  and related methods and formulations 
in  we expanded our intellectual property estate through our collaboration with the mayo clinic and licensed invader detection technology from hologic  which we plan to incorporate into our cologuard test 
we have an extensive license to markers  digital pcr  and other technologies applicable to the detection of colon cancer from johns hopkins university  and have additional licensed intellectual property from mdx health formerly oncomethylome and case western reserve university 
we have generated limited operating revenues since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years  and it is possible we may never achieve profitability 
priorities in  we will devote significant time and resources finalizing the design of and commencing the pivotal fda clinical trial for our cologuard test 
currently we expect between  and  patients to be enrolled in the trial 
we anticipate commencing patient enrollment in the second half of and believe the enrollment process will take approximately months to complete 
to expedite completion of the trial we anticipate beginning to collect patient samples in the second half of although we do not expect to start processing these samples until we expect to spend approximately million over the next two years to complete the trial 
however  the trial design will be subject to ongoing discussions with the fda and could change  potentially significantly 
if for any reason this trial is not successful or is substantially delayed or for any other reason we are unable to successfully commercialize our cologuard test  our business and prospects would likely be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents as part of preparing for the commencement of the clinical trial and with the goal of expediting receipt of a favorable coverage decision  we are working with the center for medicare and medicaid cms to coordinate the conduct of the trial with the cms coverage review process for our cologuard test 
we also plan to focus on developing the market for our cologuard test during this includes hiring a senior vice president for commercial development  conducting additional product validation studies  publishing scientific papers regarding our sdna colorectal cancer screening technology and expanding our outreach to physicians  third party payors and advocates 
we plan to concentrate our commercialization efforts initially on key opinion leader physicians who are strongly focused on the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer 
financial overview revenue our revenue is comprised of the amortization of up front license fees for the licensing of certain patent rights to labcorp and genzyme and product royalty fees on tests sold by labcorp utilizing our technology 
we expect that product royalty fees for the full year will be consistent with amounts recorded in in we recorded the final amortization of million for the up front license payment from labcorp  therefore  we expect that license fee revenue resulting from the amortization of the up front license payments in will be less than amounts recorded in  as the only future amortization will be the up front license fees from genzyme 
our cost structure our selling  general and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses incurred in support of our commercialization efforts and  non cash stock based compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  certain third party royalty obligations  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition license fees 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we entered into an amendment to our exclusive license 
table of contents agreement with labcorp  which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we amortized the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the amendment of million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ended in december in connection with our january strategic transaction with genzyme corporation  genzyme agreed to pay us a total of million  of which million was paid on january  and million was subject to a holdback by genzyme to satisfy certain potential indemnification obligations in exchange for the assignment and licensing of certain intellectual property to genzyme 
our on going performance obligations to genzyme under the collaboration  license and purchase agreement the clp agreement  as described below  including our obligation to deliver certain intellectual property improvements to genzyme during the initial five year collaboration period  were deemed to be undelivered elements of the clp agreement on the date of closing 
accordingly  we deferred the initial million in cash received at closing and are amortizing that up front payment on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january we received the first holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the first quarter of and the second holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the third quarter of the amounts were deferred and are being amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the remaining term of the collaboration at the time of receipt 
in addition  genzyme paid per share for the  shares of our common stock purchased on january   representing a premium of per share above the closing price of our common stock on that date of per share 
the aggregate premium paid by genzyme over the closing price of our common stock on the date of the transaction of million is deemed to be a part of the total consideration for the clp agreement 
accordingly  we deferred the aggregate million premium and are amortizing that amount on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january in total  we recognized approximately million in license fee revenue in connection with the amortization of the up front payments and holdback amounts from genzyme during the year ended december  stock based compensation in accordance with gaap  all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock  and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan espp if certain parameters are not met  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
the following assumptions are used in determining fair value for employee stock options and espp shares valuation and recognition the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of employee stock options is recognized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
expected term the company uses the simplified calculation of expected life  described in the sec staff accounting bulletins and  as the company does not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term 
using this method  the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted 

table of contents expected volatility expected volatility is based on the company historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the awards 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
forfeitures the company records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
no forfeiture rate was utilized for awards granted prior to due to the monthly vesting terms of the options granted in that timeframe 
because of the vesting terms  the company was  in effect  recording stock based compensation only for those awards that were vesting and expected to vest and a forfeiture rate was not necessary 
awards granted in and that vest annually are all expected to vest and no forfeiture rate was utilized 
the fair value of each restricted stock award is determined on the date of grant using the closing stock price on that day 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimate third party royalty obligation pursuant to the terms of the agreement the company has with labcorp  we agreed to reimburse labcorp million for certain third party royalty payments 
based on anticipated sales of colosure  as of december   we accrued a total of  related to the total potential remaining liability of million 
as of december  we had paid million in payments to labcorp  to fully satisfy this liability 
we recorded charges of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  in connection with this third party royalty obligation 
these charges were recorded under the caption product royalty fees in our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting estimate tax positions a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets is reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company has incurred significant losses since its inception and due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income  management has determined that a million and million valuation allowance at december  and is necessary to reduce the tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the change in valuation allowance for the current year is million 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the company effective tax rate 
in and  the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity financial statements  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as required by the new guidance issued by the fasb  the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  the company applied this guidance to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open  and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was none 
there have been no changes in unrecognized tax benefits since the adoption date  nor are there any tax positions where it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of 
table of contents unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the months following december  recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu fair value measurement and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance provides for the following new required disclosures related to fair value measurements the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level one and level two inputs and separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number for level three reconciliations 
the guidance also clarifies the existing disclosures as follows provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used for both recurring and nonrecurring level two or level three inputs 
the company has adopted this standard and it did not have a material effect on the company consolidated balance sheet or required financial statement disclosures 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued their final consensus for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as codified in asc  revenue recognition 
when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  asc will require the company to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
additionally  this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fee payments associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp and our collaboration  license and purchase agreement with genzyme 
the unamortized labcorp up front payment was amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ended in december the unamortized genzyme up front payment and holdback amounts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial genzyme collaboration period  which ends in january revenues also include royalties on labcorp sales of colosure as well as charges for our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp which are recorded as reductions to revenue under financial accounting guidance 
the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the receipt in of the genzyme holdback amounts of million which are being amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the collaboration period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased research and development activities in support of our efforts to develop and seek fda approval for our cologuard test 
the increase in research and development expenses included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in lab related expenses  million in research collaborations  million in professional fees  million in non cash stock based compensation expenses  and million in other research and 
table of contents development expenses 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in license and royalty fees of million due primarily to million of non cash stock based expenses recognized in related to common stock warrants issued by us in june to the mayo clinic foundation pursuant to our license agreement with the mayo clinic foundation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of million in transaction costs related to the genzyme strategic transaction in january  including million in legal  audit  and investment banking fees as well as approximately million in retention bonus payments made to employees pursuant to board approved retention agreements 
also contributing to this overall decrease was a reduction in non cash stock based compensation expense of million in compared to  as well as a decrease of million in personnel related costs 
these decreases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by increases of million in other general and administrative costs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts and activities in support of our efforts to develop and commercialize our cologuard test 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to less favorable interest rates for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of other income 
other income increased to  for the year ended december  from none for the year ended december  this increase was due to the receipt of a grant for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project issued by the federal government in restructuring 
in july  we took actions to reduce our cost structure to help preserve our cash resources  which we refer to as the restructuring 
these actions included suspending the clinical validation study of our version technology  eliminating eight positions  or of our staff  and seeking the re negotiation of certain fixed commitments 
in connection with the restructuring and our cost reduction efforts  in december  we entered into a sublease agreement  with qteros  inc to sublease to qteros the majority of the remaining space at our former corporate headquarters 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september   including million in one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with each of the terminated employees and million resulting from the write off of leasehold improvements abandoned by us in connection with the reduction in force 
our decision to eliminate of our workforce as part of the restructuring was deemed to be an impairment indicator under financial accounting standards 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  non cash asset impairment charges of million were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
the remaining amounts in the restructuring accrual were paid out in cash in july these amounts were recorded under the caption accrued expenses in the company consolidated balance sheets

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of an increase in license fee revenue of million resulting from the genzyme strategic transaction 
in addition  product royalty fees were approximately million higher for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  due primarily to charges of million recorded during in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
these charges to product royalty revenue resulted in negative product royalty revenue for the year ended december  we recorded charges of  during the year ended december  in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased research and development activities in support of our efforts to develop and seek fda approval for our cologuard test

interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to less favorable interest rates for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement with labcorp  and cash received in january from genzyme in connection with the genzyme strategic transaction 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives

the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increased research and development activities 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to increases in research and development activities and to million paid to labcorp related to our third party royalty obligation

however  since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan  the primary goal of which is developing and commercializing an fda approved non invasive sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening test 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of such plan  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plan and otherwise scale back our operations 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to complete our plan  we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable

the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate
