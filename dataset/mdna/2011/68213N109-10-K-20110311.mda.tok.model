item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical and surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
approximately of our product revenue is from outside the united states and canada  although we believe adoption of our products internationally will increase in future years 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
we have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the us department of state  or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
in general  we recognize revenue when our systems are installed 
for all of our products except mobile carts  installation generally takes place two weeks to nine months after our systems are ordered 
installation of mobile carts generally takes place one to three months after the order is received 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with integrating large capital expenditures and time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  timing of customer installations  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
our revenue increased by from million in to million in of the million increase in revenues from to  million was attributable to an increase in service revenues due to growth in the installed customer base over time and the later than expected timing of customer purchase orders for service contracts covering service periods commencing in the modest million increase in product revenues for as compared with reflects the continued unstable economic environment during both periods as healthcare facilities continued to reduce or postpone their capital spending 
we believe that economic conditions are improving and that spending in the healthcare industry and demand for our products will increase in the future 
we believe 
table of contents that the following four factors will be responsible for generating demand for our products in future periods we believe that the overall market demand for healthcare services will increase as the population grows  life expectancies continue to increase  the quality of healthcare services increases and the availability of healthcare services increases  we believe that the environment of increased patient safety awareness  increased regulatory control and increased need for workflow efficiency through the adoption of technology in the healthcare industry will make our solutions a priority in the capital budgets of healthcare facilities  we have continued to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to provide the best customer experience in the healthcare industry  and we have delivered industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses  pharmacists  supply chain managers  chief information officers and hospital management 
our product backlog  consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  increased from million as of december  to million at december  while our customers experienced a challenging financial environment caused by macroeconomic conditions  which contributed to decreasing investment returns  decreasing hospital foundation donations and decreasing reimbursement for procedures and services performed  we believe the macroeconomic environment that caused our customers to postpone their acquisition decisions began to improve in the latter half of even with this apparent improvement  however  we are likely to continue experiencing delays in closing contracts until economic conditions appreciably improve 
in addition  beginning in we saw our order mix shift towards larger institutions and replacement of systems sold by our competitors  which caused increased variability in our order rates and size of orders and may cause increased variability in the timing of future revenues 
we expect to operate through with backlog within our objective of six to nine months of forward revenue but we believe there will be variation from time to time in the total dollar value of orders in backlog 
our key business strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer product and service requirements  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceeding our customers installation and support needs 
sustaining technological leadership in our products by consistently innovating our product and service offerings  bringing new products and technologies to market through acquisitions and partnerships  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
in order to implement these strategies during  we increased our sales organization to expand coverage of our growing installed base and to expand our reach to new customers  expanded our proprietary product offerings through the acquisition of pandora data systems  
table of contents continued to announce and deliver new proprietary product offerings such as the savvy mobile medication system  the pandora via analytical software  and the workflowrx unit dose packager  and expanded our market presence with new business partnerships with cardinal health and rxscan 
our healthcare customers expect a high degree of partnership from their technology suppliers 
omnicell provides extensive installation planning and consulting as part of every product sale 
our customers medication control systems are mission critical to their success and our customers require the systems to be functional at all times 
to help assure the maximum availability of our systems  our customers purchase maintenance and support contracts in one  two or five year increments 
our long term liabilities  which were million as of december  and million as of december   are principally composed of long term deferred service revenue  which was million as of december   and million as of december  our deferred service revenue will be amortized to service revenue as the service contracts are executed 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million primarily due to improved net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation  amortization and share based compensation  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
the increases to cash were offset by million in investing cash outflows for purchases of short term investments  the acquisition of pandora data systems  and the acquisition and development of productive long lived assets 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million  primarily due to lower accounts receivable  increased deferred service contracts and net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation  amortization and share based compensation 
net cash provided by operations continued to be positive for the fifth consecutive year at million for the year ended december  and our cash and cash equivalents balance plus short term investments as of december  was million 
we expect cash provided by operations to remain positive in our full time headcount of on december  was the same as our full time headcount on december   but the functional mix changed including a increase in direct territory sales staff during the fourth quarter of and offsetting reductions in other functional areas from consolidations and organizational changes earlier in the year 
in the first quarter of  we reduced our headcount significantly to align our business with overall demand for our products 
our full time headcount declined from on december  to on december  we record compensation costs of share based awards  options and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with asc  stock compensation formerly referred to as sfas no 
r 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  down from million in we anticipate that the growth rate of our expenses from share based compensation  may  at times  exceed the future growth rate of our revenues 
our gross profit increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  with gross margins increasing by to 
the increases in gross profits and related margins were driven primarily by higher service revenues on an expanded installed base without proportional increases in service costs  favorable product mix to higher margin products and overall operational efficiencies in our production and customer service operations 
we expect revenues to increase modestly in and we do not anticipate any major fluctuations in our gross margin beyond normal fluctuations caused by changes in product mix although revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected as a result of market price reductions and additional costs to expand our business 

table of contents net income increased to million in compared to million in due to higher gross profit of million as compared with  which included a million increase in gross profit from service revenues and million from product revenues 
this increase was partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses primarily due to increased research and development activities  and a million increase in income taxes 
we also recorded pretax restructuring charges of million in for facilities consolidation and million in for a workforce reduction to align our business with overall demand for our products 
we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our chief operating decision maker  who is our chief executive officer  along with our management team evaluates our profit performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
the september acquisition of pandora data systems resulted in neither the creation of a new reporting unit nor a new operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our hardware products are integrated with software that is essential to their functionality 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with asc  software formerly referred to as statement of position no 

for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
product delivery 
software and hardware product delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
in instances of a customer self installed installation  product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter 

table of contents fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
in general  for sales not requiring our installation  we recognize sales on delivery of products to our customers 
we recognize sales on shipment to distributors since we do not have further installation obligations and we do not allow for rights of return 
we separately sell training and professional services which are not part of multiple element arrangements and not integral to the performance of our systems 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
vsoe of training and of professional services is based on the price paid when sold separately 
a portion of our sales are made through multi year lease agreements 
we recognize product related revenue under sales type leases at the net present value of the lease payment stream under asc  leases formally referred to as sfas no 
 once our installation obligations are met 
in order to optimize cash flows  we generally sell our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis 
we exclude from revenue any payments we receive for a new sale that relate to the termination of an existing lease 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease is sold 
some of our lease sales  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house as sales type leases which we account for in accordance with asc interest income in sales type leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for allowances 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly referred to as sfas no 

for the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangibles resulting from business combinations  we use the guidance in asc goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
to perform the goodwill impairment test  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit carrying value 
we believe we are one reporting unit  and therefore  we compare our fair value to the total net asset value on our balance sheet 
if our total net asset value were to exceed our fair value  we would perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we would compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to our carrying amount  taking a write down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value 
if our fair value 
table of contents exceeds the carrying value of our net assets under step one  then no impairment is indicated and the test is complete 
we passed the first step of our annual impairment test for in addition  there were no indicators of impairment as of december  we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain purchased intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset carrying amount 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
significant management judgment is also required for initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangibles assets resulting from business combinations per asc management must assess the extent to which identified other intangibles assets are properly includable and with the appropriate fair value or properly excludable  by applying the recognition criteria 
this judgment affects not only the other intangible assets but the remainder calculation of goodwill 
the assessment of useful life for each acquired intangible impacts future financial position and operating performance through amortization expense 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  using the first in  first out method or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence  excess or unmarketable quantities equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over their vesting period or requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc accounting for income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with gaap  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial 
table of contents reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in the event that these tax rates change  we will incur a benefit or detriment on our income tax expense in the period of change 
we can also determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  we will record a valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes formerly referred to as sfas no 
 we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
our management concluded that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective in providing reasonable assurance that a material misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis  our evaluation concluded that we have a material weakness related to accounting for income taxes 
specifically  our processes  procedures and controls related to the preparation and review of the annual tax provision were not effective to ensure that amounts recorded for the tax provision and the related current and deferred income tax asset and liability accounts were accurate and determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
notwithstanding the above mentioned material weakness  we believe that the consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects as of the year ended december  our management has committed to the following corrective actions for the current fiscal year re assessing the relationship with our third party consultant to ensure that there is an adequate level of review of the tax provision performed by the consultant and an appropriate level of oversight and validation by our management  ensuring the internal review processes are carefully executed and monitored to properly account for changes to the underlying supporting documentation  and implementing and utilizing income tax software to ensure a comprehensive reconciliation of all balance sheet tax accounts to our financial reporting system 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards updates  or asu and  or asu and asu  which amended asc  revenue recognition  and asc  software revenue recognition  respectively 
asu requires companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple element arrangements based on an element estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of selling price is not available 
asu revises the guidance regarding the types of arrangements that fall under the scope of the software recognition guidance  providing a scope exception for many transactions that were previously within the scope of subtopic asc  including tangible products containing software components and non software components that function 
table of contents together to deliver the product essential functionality and places them under subtopic asc  thus requiring the new multiple element revenue allocation under asu both asu and asu are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and we intend to adopt these asus at the beginning of our fiscal year we are currently evaluating how the adoption of these asus will impact our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as asu  amending asc  receivables 
asu requires certain disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
in addition  disclosures are required related to the nature of credit risk inherent in the portfolio of financing receivables  how the credit risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
for public entities  the new disclosures for the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december   with new disclosures about period activity effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  the period end disclosures are effective for us for december   and the period activity disclosures are effective beginning with the first quarter of as asu is a disclosure standard  we do not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have any impact on our operating results  financial position or cash flows

we expect product revenues to increase modestly in and we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations in our gross margin beyond normal fluctuations caused by changes in product mix 
compared to product revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of installations of medication and supply automation systems and central pharmacy products  from both existing and new customers in our us domestic markets which was due to general economic conditions affecting hospital capital purchasing 
cost of product revenues decreased by million  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in product revenue resulting in a million decrease in direct standard cost  and a decrease in spending of million which was driven by lower headcount as a result of restructuring relating to our workforce reduction in the first quarter of and associated headcount related expenses such as travel 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in other costs  including million related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory

cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in spending of million primarily related to salaries and related benefits costs and replacement part costs in support of the expanded service base 
gross profit on service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase in gross margin on service and other revenues was due to the aforementioned revenue growth from service contracts initiated in with purchase orders received in and from normal growth on an expanded installed base without a proportional growth in service costs as these were incurred in prior periods 
we expect our service and other revenues and the associated gross profit to increase for  in line with the continued expansion of our installed base of automation systems and service and maintenance contracts  the addition of service revenues associated with our recent acquisition of pandora data systems 
and continued cost controls 
compared to service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increases in service and other revenues was primarily due to the result of an expansion in our installed base of automation systems and a resulting increase in number of support service contracts

research and development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in was due to an increase of million in consulting expenses  an increase of million of labor and related costs  both of which are related to new hardware and software product development  and a decrease of million of software capitalization in compared to primarily due the release in of two major software releases used in our products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase slightly as we continue to invest in new products 
the amount of research and development expense can fluctuate based on the amount of proto type expenses for hardware and or the amount of capitalized software development costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
three areas of spending increased the selling  general and administrative expenses 
these were million of fees related to potential acquisition assessment activities  million related to marketing programs to increase brand awareness  and million associated with rising costs of operations  including million increase in employee health and dental benefits  million increase in group purchasing organization fees associated with higher sales volume to group purchasing organization affiliated customers  and million increase in travel 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in legal fees which included a million benefit from the settlement of a litigation claim for less than the amount previously accrued and a decrease of bad debt expense of million primarily due to the recovery of a fully reserved accounts receivable balance and lower non specific bad debt reserve requirements based on improved historical experience 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs to increase in  in both dollars and as a percentage of revenues due to an increase of direct territory sales representatives 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges of million incurred in related to the closure of facilities in the woodlands  texas and bangalore  india 
costs recorded related primarily to severance and relocation pay  lease terminations  asset impairment charges  consulting  and travel

compared to research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to a million increase in capitalized software  primarily due to the development of two major releases of our software used in our products  which moved expenditures from expenses to capital projects  offset by an increase of million in outside services 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million of decreases associated with lower sales volume and headcount  a decrease of million in bad debt expense associated with the decrease in accounts receivable balances  and a decrease of million in expenses related to share based compensation charges associated with asc these decreases were partially offset by increased investment in the marketing of our products 
restructuring charges 
the decrease in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in was partially the result of our work force reduction during the first quarter of  which lowered headcount by employees  but resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
these restructuring costs were primarily severance pay  continuation of benefits and outplacement services

table of contents income taxes years ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  compared to million and effective tax rate for the year ended december  the annual tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and a one time tax adjustment of approximately million for the tax effect of undistributed foreign earnings  triggered by the closure of our india subsidiary as part of our third quarter restructuring program 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  compared to million and effective tax rate for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to prior year true up of approximately million and the re measurement of our california deferred tax assets to reflect the enactment of california tax legislation  effective january  refer to note income taxes for discussion of factors affecting realizability of deferred tax assets
