our company we are a leading custom manufacturer of fine chemicals  specialty chemicals and propulsion products within our focused markets 
our fine chemicals products represent the active pharmaceutical ingredient api or registered intermediate in certain anti viral  oncology and central nervous system drugs 
our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment products are utilized in national defense programs and provide access to  and movement in  space  via solid propellant and propulsion thrusters 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the mission critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop customized solutions that meet rigorous federal and international regulatory standards 
we generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or limited source supplier 
we are the only north american producer of ammonium perchlorate  or ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in order to diversify our business and leverage our strong technical and manufacturing capabilities  we have made three strategic acquisitions in recent years 
each of these acquisitions provided long term customer relationships with sole source and limited source contracts and leadership positions in growing markets 
on october   we acquired the former atlantic research corporation s liquid in space propulsion business from aerojet general corporation  which became our aerospace equipment segment 
effective october   we further expanded our aerospace equipment segment with the acquisition of marotta holdings limited subsequently renamed ampac isp holdings limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively ampac isp holdings 
our us based aerospace equipment operation is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
ampac isp holdings designs  develops and manufactures high performance valves  pressure regulators  cold gas propulsion systems  and precision structures for space applications  especially in the european space market 
on november   we acquired gencorp inc s fine chemicals business  through our wholly owned subsidiary ampac fine chemicals llc  which is now our fine chemicals segment 
our fine chemicals segment is a leading custom manufacturer of certain apis and registered intermediates for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our business segments our operations comprise four reportable business segments fine chemicals  specialty chemicals  aerospace equipment and other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the years ended september fine chemicals specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues less than fine chemicals 
our fine chemicals segment  operated through our wholly owned subsidiaries ampac fine chemicals llc and ampac fine chemicals texas  llc collectively afc  is a custom manufacturer of apis and registered intermediates for commercial customers in the pharmaceutical industry 
the products we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with indications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
we generate nearly all of our fine chemicals segment sales from manufacturing chemical compounds that are proprietary to our customers 
we operate in compliance with the us food and drug administration s the fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp and the requirements of certain other regulatory agencies such as the european union s european medicines agency and japan s pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technological position  combined with our chemical process development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
in addition  our rancho cordova  california facility is both us based and located within a secured industrial complex providing us with certain advantages for the commercial scale production of controlled substances 
we believe that this will be an area of expansion for us and we have invested in facilities that meet the requirements of the drug enforcement agency 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  manufacturing chemical compounds that require high containment and performing energetic chemistries at commercial scale 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using commercial scale simulated moving bed  or smb  technology and own and operate two large scale smb machines  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we believe our distinctive competency in manufacturing chemical compounds that require specialized high containment facilities and handling expertise provide us a significant competitive advantage in competing for various opportunities associated with high potency  highly toxic and cytotoxic products 
many oncology drugs are made with apis and registered intermediates that are high potency or cytotoxic 
afc is one of the few companies in the world that can manufacture such compounds at a multi ton annual rate 
moreover  our significant experience and specially engineered facilities make us one of the few companies in the world with the capability to use energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of products such as those used in anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  sole source and limited source contracts with our customers  which help provide us with earnings stability and visibility 
in addition  the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturing encourages stable  long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a custom manufacturer has been qualified as a supplier on a cgmp product  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing of the product to an alternative supplier  including the following alternative supply may not be readily available 
we are currently the sole source supplier on several of our fine chemicals products 
regulatory approval 
applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approvals and could take as long as two years to complete 
significant financial costs 
switching contractors and amending various filings can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities around the world 
specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical primarily used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems 
we have supplied ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and we have been the only ap supplier in north america since  when we acquired the ap business of our principal competitor  kerr mcgee chemical corporation 
demand for ap is currently driven by rockets and missiles used in national defense programs that are powered by solid propellant 
also  a significant number of existing and planned space launch vehicles use solid propellant and thus depend  in part  upon our ap 
alliant techsystems inc or atk is a significant ap customer 
we sell grade i ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for grade i ap and that requires atk to purchase its grade i ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual grade i ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
pricing varies inversely to volume and includes annual escalations 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our aerospace equipment segment is a major us and european manufacturer of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion thrusters  valves  structures and propulsion systems 
these components are used on commercial satellites  launch vehicles  targets  interceptors and deep space probes 
both our us and european locations design  develop  qualify and manufacture products for the space industry with each location having specific core strengths that are used in a synergetic manner to benefit the whole segment 
other businesses 
our other businesses segment contains our water treatment equipment division and real estate activities 
our water treatment equipment business markets  designs  and manufactures electrochemical on site hypochlorite generation  or oshg systems 
these systems are used in the disinfection of drinking water  control of noxious odors  and the treatment of seawater to prevent the growth of marine organisms in cooling systems 
we supply our equipment to municipal  industrial and offshore customers

results of operations revenues year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
fine chemicals specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues fine chemicals 
fine chemicals segment revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from oncology and central nervous systems cns products increased and  respectively 
we experienced a gap in production for our most significant anti viral product that impacted the later part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal since both fiscal periods were affected  anti viral product revenues were consistent between fiscal and fiscal sales of this anti viral product  under a renewed three year supply agreement  began in the fiscal third quarter 
the increase in oncology revenues is largely due to timing shifts from fiscal into fiscal  driven by customer inventory levels and production line availability 
the increase in cns revenue is largely due to one customer s timing of its product demand 
revenues from development products continue to become an increasing component of fine chemicals segment revenues  exceeding of fine chemicals segment revenues in fiscal growth in this area has resulted from an intensified focus on core technologies and diversification of products and customers 
development product revenues include revenues from research products  products which are not yet commercialized  and products which are commercial but for which we are not the current commercial producer 
typically  development product activities are the source for future core products 
the products categorized as development products are used by our customers primarily for drugs with indications in anti viral  cns  oncology and pain management 
revenues in this category also include the milling of cytotoxic materials  a capability we added in fiscal for fiscal  the decrease in fine chemicals segment revenues  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily reflects declines in core product revenues from anti viral products of  cns products of  and oncology products of 
anti viral product revenues declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of an approximately reduction in volume for the anti viral product that was our largest core product in fiscal the volume decline for this product is due to the timing of completing the development of a new manufacturing process 
the decrease in cns product revenues resulted from a customer advising us in may that they were deferring additional orders until calendar year the decrease in oncology product revenues is primarily attributable to using certain manufacturing capacity for development products 
certain of these development products are apis used to make drugs with oncology indications 
fiscal revenues from development products increased as compared to fiscal fine chemicals segment revenues are anticipated to increase by at least in fiscal the anticipated increase is supported by expected growth in revenues from our most significant anti viral product as we enter into the first full year of production for this product under the renewed three year supply agreement 
more generally  the pharmaceutical markets are being driven by strong demand for products that use our core technologies  including hiv related drugs and oncology drugs  most of which are expected to use energetic and high potency compounds 
since a large percentage of new drugs is anticipated to be based on chirally pure material  we believe our investment in smb technology may be a strong competitive advantage for us in the future 
we believe there is a continuing trend toward more outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry  especially for pharmaceutical ingredients that require specialized equipment or technologies  such as smb or high containment manufacturing 
afc s pipeline of development products continues to grow  reflecting this trend 
as mentioned above  revenues from development products have increased significantly over the last several fiscal years 
in addition  we have recently expanded our technology offerings to include commercial scale production of schedule ii to v controlled substances in our high security facilities in rancho cordova  california 
we believe that this will be an area of expansion for us 
specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising   and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors an decrease in perchlorate volume offset by a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal a decrease in perchlorate volume offset by a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal sodium azide revenues increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in total perchlorate volume for fiscal is primarily due to limited demand for grade i ap for usage on space programs 
tactical and strategic missile program demand continues to be stable and accounts for the largest component of grade i ap volume in fiscal the ares program was the largest component of volume in fiscal the decline in grade i ap demand is offset by an increase in volume for our other perchlorate products  which was approximately higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in the average price per pound of perchlorates in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects two offsetting factors 
the average price per pound of grade i ap increased approximately proportionate and inverse to the decrease in grade i ap volume consistent with the contractual grade i ap price volume matrix  under which price and volume move inversely  and comparable catalog pricing 
this increase was partially offset because revenues from our other lower value perchlorate products  such as sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate  accounted for a substantially greater percentage of all perchlorate product volume in fiscal this has the effect of reducing the average unit price for perchlorates 
the decrease in total perchlorate volume for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects an approximately decrease in ap volume for space related programs  offset by increases in volume for our other perchlorate products 
while the ares program was the most significant space program for fiscal  the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor rsrm program was the most significant space program in fiscal volumes for tactical and strategic missiles were consistent between fiscal and fiscal the increase in average price per pound of perchlorates in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects two offsetting factors the average price per pound of grade i ap increased approximately proportionate and inverse to the decrease in grade i ap volume consistent with the contractual grade i ap price volume matrix and comparable catalog pricing 
this was offset  in part  by our other lower priced perchlorate products  such as sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate  which accounted for a greater percentage of all perchlorate product volume in the fiscal periods 
this change in the mix of perchlorate product sales had a reducing effect on the overall average price per pound of all perchlorate products 
specialty chemicals segment revenues are expected to decline by up to in fiscal  which we believe is within the expected stable range for this non growth segment 
we expect grade i ap demand in fiscal to be approximately the same as fiscal the mix of applications and specifications of the product  however  will be much different 
in fiscal  we expect the return of development motors for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa heavy lift vehicle which is part of the new space launch system 
over the longer term  we expect annual demand for grade i ap to be within the range of million to million pounds based on nasa and us department of defense dod production programs 
we believe that ap demand for dod programs will be stable over the next several years 
nasa demand for space related programs may vary depending on congressional and nasa decisions regarding the direction of the space program 
in addition  grade i ap revenues are typically derived from relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the changes in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and fiscal are due primarily to fluctuation in demand for sodium azide used in pharmaceutical applications 
we do not anticipate a significant increase in demand for sodium azide in fiscal changes in halotron revenues have been driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be relatively consistent year over year 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  isp 
revenue growth of for the aerospace equipment segment during fiscal  as compared to the prior fiscal year  was generated primarily by increases in revenues from space propulsion systems contracts from the segment s us operations  which have demonstrated success in penetrating this market 
increases in revenues from in space propulsion engines also contributed to the revenue growth in fiscal growth in engine sales is due to expansion of the market base for this segment s advanced bipropellant acs engine  both in the us and europe 
in addition  contract awards for several us defense satellite programs and increased commercial satellite wins by a major customer have also contributed to revenue growth in fiscal for fiscal  our aerospace equipment segment produced record high revenues while maintaining substantial backlog 
through multi year efforts with the us air force  we were able to enter the green propellant market with two major program awards 
in europe  we were funded by the european space agency for development of a kn thruster for use on interplanetary probes 
we are continuing to expand our customer base for the pound platinum rhodium engines with a recent contract award 
revenue growth of for the aerospace equipment segment during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was generated from both its us and european operations 
the primary growth component was revenue from sales of space propulsion engines  which increased in fiscal due largely to growth in the communication and commercial satellite markets 
in july  our aerospace equipment segment finalized a two year contract with ohb system ag of bremen  germany  to produce fourteen propulsion modules for the full operational capability portion of the satellite supported european navigation system program 
the constellation of navigation satellites will provide gps type coverage for a wide variety of users throughout the world 
aerospace equipment segment revenues are anticipated to grow modestly in fiscal fiscal was a year of substantial revenue growth for this segment 
the average growth rate of fiscal and fiscal combined should result in a normalized expectation for this segment 
other businesses 
other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment and related spare parts sales and real estate revenues 
water treatment equipment sales decreased  in fiscal and increased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal years 
the revenue variances were driven by the timing of new system sales and shipments 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage in addition to the factors detailed below  one of the most significant factors that affects  and should continue to affect  the comparison of our consolidated gross margins from period to period is the change in revenue mix between our segments 
fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the following segment factors affect our consolidated gross margin comparisons between fiscal and fiscal fine chemicals 
the fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage declined five points compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary reason for the decline in gross margin was continued difficulties with implementation of a process improvement that was intended to offset reduced pricing on a core product and extended equipment maintenance 
these difficulties contributed to below target through put rates and material reprocessing 
fine chemicals segment profitability is anticipated to improve substantially in fiscal to achieve these improvements  we are targeting process improvements which enhance manufacturing throughput and product yields 
we do not anticipate reaching these targets until late in fiscal specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment profits for fiscal are atypically high compared to profits generated in fiscal years with a more traditional mix of product revenues 
gross margin increased two percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a much larger percentage of firm fixed price ap sales orders compared to re determinably priced sales orders in the fiscal year  while  the opposite was true in fiscal firm fixed price orders carry more profit risk because of potential sales volume volatility  but also provide the potential of higher margins when the volatility works in our favor 
secondary reasons for the gross margin increase in fiscal include increased sales of multi purpose perchlorates and recycled perchlorates compared to the prior fiscal year 
profit contribution from our specialty chemicals segment is expected to decline in fiscal this is consistent with the anticipated reduction in revenues and the transition back to a more typical mix of product revenues 
aerospace equipment 
aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage improved three points in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to us process improvement actions implemented for space propulsion systems contracts 
gross margin improvements from the us operations were offset partially by a change in product mix of the european products 
fiscal included a greater percentage of certain lower margin european products than did fiscal fiscal cost of revenues decreased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage was for both fiscal and fiscal the following segment factors affect our consolidated gross margin comparisons between fiscal and fiscal fine chemicals 
the fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage declined six points compared to the prior fiscal year 
reduced volume was the primary contributor to the reduction 
in addition  the segment experienced several manufacturing inefficiencies including increases in cycle times for certain core products  higher than anticipated costs associated with validating a process change for a core product  and higher than anticipated efforts associated with certain development products 
specialty chemicals 
the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved six points because fiscal included a greater percentage of non grade i ap volume and fiscal benefited from unique cost items such as lower utilities and production variances 
aerospace equipment 
the aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage declined seven points primarily due to increases in estimated costs to complete certain systems contracts 
these cost increases occurred primarily because engineering and design required more efforts than anticipated  as well as because there were certain quality issues with supplier product 
operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
operating expenses percentage of revenues fiscal operating expenses decreased  to  from  for fiscal primarily as a result of corporate operating expenses were reduced by  cost reduction activities generated savings of  primarily in the areas of travel and professional services  which were offset somewhat by increases in board of directors and other strategic expenses 
fine chemicals segment operating expenses were reduced by  reflecting property tax and insurance savings 
the specialty chemicals segment achieved operating expenses savings of approximately reflecting primarily lower insurance and professional services costs 
fiscal operating expenses increased  to  from  for fiscal primarily as a result of a  increase in fine chemicals segment operating expenses that is largely attributed to enhanced business development activities  as well as in additional costs associated with our then recently acquired facility in texas 
an increase in aerospace equipment segment operating expenses of  that includes additional research and development expenses and additional management and organizational structure required to support the business growth 
research and development activities  which amounted to approximately  were focused in the area of product development  including aerospace valves and enhancements to our thruster engines 
a decrease in corporate operating expenses of the most significant components of this decrease include a reduction in corporate development expenses of  an increase in costs associated with our board of directors of  and other individually insignificant increases and decreases which aggregate to a decrease of environmental remediation charges 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded environmental remediation charges of  and  respectively  reflecting increases in our total cost estimate of probable costs for our henderson  nevada groundwater remediation operations 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
other operating gains 
during fiscal  our fine chemicals segment reported other operating gains of  that resulted from the resolution of gain contingencies 
the total reported gain is comprised of the following two matters 
we made a series of filings with the county of sacramento  california  to appeal the assessed values in prior years of our real and personal property located at our fine chemicals segment s rancho cordova  california facility 
during fiscal  we received  for cash property tax refunds resulting from our appeals and the related favorable reassessment of historical property values 
our fine chemicals segment is undertaking several mandatory capital projects 
certain of the capital activities are complete and others are in progress or otherwise expected to be completed during fiscal in connection with these projects  our fine chemicals segment held  and continues to hold  negotiations with the former owner of the facilities 
during fiscal  we received from the former owner cash consideration in the amount of for a limited release of liability of the former owner with respect to one of the completed projects

backlog agreements with our fine chemicals segment customers typically include multi year supply agreements 
these agreements may contain provisional order volumes  minimum order quantities  take or pay provisions  termination fees and other customary terms and conditions  which we do not include in our computation of backlog 
fine chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against a related supply agreement and stand alone purchase orders 
fine chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal specialty chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against long term supply agreements and stand alone purchase orders 
specialty chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal specialty chemicals product orders are typically characterized by individually large orders which occur less frequently during the fiscal year 
this usually results in a backlog and revenue pattern which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
specialty chemicals segment backlog as of september   is atypically high relative to its annual sales volume 
our aerospace equipment segment is a government contractor  and accordingly  total backlog includes both funded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer 
we compute aerospace equipment segment total and funded backlog as the total contract value less revenues that have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
aerospace equipment segment total backlog and funded backlog were approximately  and  respectively  as of september   compared to total backlog and funded backlog of  and  respectively  as of september  we anticipate the majority of funded backlog as of september  to be completed during fiscal  with any remainder to be completed in the fiscal year ending september  interest and other income  net year ended september  percentage change vs

interest and other income  net interest income currency gains losses and other total interest expense we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances and the applicable interest rate 
in addition  during fiscal  we received interest income in the amount of related to above mentioned property tax refunds 
interest expense was consistent between fiscal  fiscal and fiscal because the interest rate for our principal outstanding debt is fixed 
income taxes 
our income tax expense benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance interest and penalties foreign tax rate differential other effective tax rate deferred tax assets are comprised of the following at september deferred tax assets environmental remediation reserves pension obligations tax credits and carryforwards intangible assets inventory accrued expenses other subtotal valuation allowance deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities property  plant and equipment prepaid expenses other deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax assets deferred tax assets arise primarily because expenses have been recorded in historical financial statement periods which will not become deductible for income taxes until future tax years 
we record valuation allowances to reduce the book value of our deferred tax assets to amounts that are estimated to be more likely than not realized 
this assessment requires judgment and is performed on the basis of the weight of all available evidence  both positive and negative  with greater weight placed in information that is objectively verifiable such as historical performance 
for the three year period ended september   we are reporting a cumulative net loss 
pursuant to guidance from the financial accounting standards board  a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that must be considered and this form of negative evidence is difficult to overcome without sufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence 
our objectively verifiable positive evidence includes certain aspects of our historical results 
additional positive evidence includes forecasts of future taxable income 
however  since this latter form of evidence is not objectively verifiable  its weight is not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we increased our valuation allowance by  as of september  of this amount   was recorded as income tax expense and  was charged to other comprehensive loss offsetting deferred tax assets that were generated in fiscal the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on having sufficient taxable income in the future years when the tax deductions associated with the deferred tax assets become deductible 
the establishment of a valuation allowance does not impact cash nor does it preclude us from using our tax credits  loss carryforwards and other deferred assets in the future

significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to an improvement in cash profits generated by our operations 
an increase in cash used for working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash income taxes refunded of  a decrease in cash paid for interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of an increase in cash used to fund pension obligations of  other increases in cash provided by operating activities of the increase in cash used for working capital accounts includes several primary components 
cash provided by specialty chemicals segment working capital accounts increased approximately  specialty chemicals segment accounts receivable balances were unusually high at september  collection of these balances in fiscal generated improvement in cash flow 
cash used by fine chemicals segment working capital accounts increased by approximately  consistent with the growth in business in fiscal cash used by aerospace equipment segment working capital accounts increased by approximately  in part due to business growth and in part because certain active contracts have less favorable billing terms than is typical for this segment 
we consider the working capital changes to be routine and within the normal production cycle of our products 
the production of most fine chemical products requires a length of time that exceeds one quarter 
in addition  the timing of aerospace equipment segment revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method differs from the timing of the related billings to customers 
therefore  in any given quarter  accounts receivable  work in progress inventory or deferred revenues and customer deposits can increase or decrease significantly 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
the increase in cash income taxes refunded is a result of federal income tax carryback claims that were filed and collected during fiscal the increase in cash used for environmental remediation relates to the henderson  nevada  expansion project 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
cash used to fund pension obligations increased because the return on pension plan assets alone was not sufficient to maintain the minimum funding requirements 
fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year  resulting in an increase of significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations 
an increase in cash provided by working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes refunded of an increase in cash paid for interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of  other decreases in cash provided by operating activities of the increase in cash provided by working capital is comprised primarily of the following factors 
the fine chemicals segment accounted for approximately  of the increase as working capital needs were reduced as a result of the lower business volume in fiscal the aerospace equipment segment accounted for approximately  of the increase  reflecting improvements in working capital management 
the other businesses segment accounted for approximately  of the increase as unusually high working capital balances as of september  returned to more normalized levels as of september  the increase in cash used for environmental remediation relates to the henderson  nevada  expansion project 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures of  for fiscal are consistent with capital expenditure levels in fiscal the capital expenditures relate to our fine chemicals segment  in particular  additional equipment to support a new three year core product agreement for the supply of anti viral products and facilities improvements to enhance quality compliance 
we are anticipating our fiscal capital expenditures  which do not include environmental remediation spending  to be consistent with fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal capital expenditures of  reflect an increase of  from capital expenditures of  in fiscal in april  our fine chemicals segment expanded its manufacturing capacity through the purchase of a fine chemicals facility in la porte  texas at a total cost of approximately  including direct purchase costs 
the purchase of this facility is accounted for as a capital expenditure 
in addition  fiscal cash flow for investing activities includes cash used for the purchase of ampac isp holdings for  net of cash acquired of financing activities cash used for financing activities for fiscal relates primarily to costs associated with the establishing of our asset based lending facility in january cash used for financing activities for fiscal  reflects the repurchase and cancellation of  in principal amount of our senior notes in june the purchase price was  which approximated the carrying value of the notes  net of deferred financing costs 
remaining financing cash flows for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal primarily reflect capital lease payments and cash flows associated with stock option exercises 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flows from operations 
in addition  as of september   we had availability of approximately  under our asset based lending credit facility which provides for a committed revolving credit line  up to a maximum of  based on our eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
for further discussion of this facility  see below under the heading abl credit facility 
we believe that changes in cash flow from operations during our fiscal periods reflect short term timing and as such do not represent significant changes in our sources and uses of cash 
because our revenues  and related customer invoices and collections  are characterized by relatively few individually significant transactions  our working capital balances can vary normally by as much as  from period to period 
we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  pension funding  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we are from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits related to our business operations and we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of litigation and other contingencies 
we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods  and  to the extent not covered by insurance  they may adversely affect our liquidity 
in contemplating the adequacy of our liquidity and available capital  we consider factors such as current results of operations  cash flows and backlog  anticipated changes in operating trends  including anticipated changes in revenues and margins  cash requirements related to our debt agreements and pension plans  and cash requirements related to our remediation activities  including amounts that we expect to spend in fiscal for the capital component of the remediation expansion project and amounts we expect to spend annually thereafter for operating and maintenance 
see further discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
we do not currently anticipate that the factors noted above will have material effects on our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements 
we anticipate funding the capital component of the remediation expansion project with cash on hand or equipment financing 
we continue to believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
long term debt and credit facilities senior notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  collectively  with the exchange notes issued in august as referenced below  the senior notes 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay our former credit facilities 
the senior notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in february and august 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our existing and future material us subsidiaries 
the senior notes are ranked equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ranked senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness  effectively junior to our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt  and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities including trade payables of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes 
the senior notes may be redeemed by us  in whole or in part  under the following circumstances at any time after february  at redemption prices beginning at of the principal amount to be redeemed and reducing to by february   and under certain changes of control  we must offer to purchase the senior notes at of their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture which contains certain customary events of default  including cross default provisions if we default under our existing and future debt agreements having  individually or in the aggregate  a principal or similar amount outstanding of at least  and certain other covenants limiting  subject to exceptions  carve outs and qualifications  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create liens on assets to secure debt  incur dividend or other payment restrictions with regard to restricted subsidiaries  transfer or sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create an unrestricted subsidiary  enter into certain business activities  or effect a consolidation  merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the senior notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement which required us to file a registration statement to offer to exchange the senior notes for notes that have substantially identical terms as the senior notes and are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes as required by the registration rights agreement  which registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
in august  we completed the exchange of of the senior notes for substantially identical notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
abl credit facility 
on january   american pacific corporation  as borrower  entered into an asset based lending credit agreement the abl credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  as agent and as lender  and certain domestic subsidiaries of the company  as guarantors  which provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  at any time outstanding with an initial maturity to be the earlier of i january  and ii days prior to the maturity date of the senior notes  which is february  the abl credit facility also provides for the issuance of new letters of credit with a letter of credit sublimit of  the maximum borrowing availability under the abl credit facility is based upon a percentage of our eligible account receivables and eligible inventories 
we may prepay and terminate the abl credit facility at any time  without premium or penalty 
the abl credit facility contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions 
the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the abl credit facility will be  at our option  either at a base rate or libor rate each as defined in the abl credit facility plus  in each case  an applicable margin of percentage points 
in addition  we will pay commitment fees  other fees related to the issuance and maintenance of the letters of credit  and certain agency fees 
the abl credit facility is guaranteed by our current and future domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the abl credit facility 
the abl credit facility contains certain negative covenants  subject to customary exceptions and exclusions  restricting and limiting our ability to  among other things incur debt  incur contingent obligations and issue certain types of preferred stock  or prepay certain debt  create liens  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  make certain investments and acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets 
the abl credit facility also contains financial covenants which are only triggered by utilization of the abl credit facility and borrowing availability not exceeding a designated threshold amount 
if the financial covenants are triggered  then we would be subject to the following financial covenants fixed charge coverage ratio 
we would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio on a rolling trailing twelve month basis of at least 
maximum capital expenditures 
the abl credit facility limits our capital expenditures in any fiscal year to amounts set forth in the abl credit facility 
the abl credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default in some cases  subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods  including cross default provisions that include the senior notes 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the abl credit facility prior to the abl credit facility s stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
on september   under the abl credit facility  we had no outstanding borrowings  had availability of  and were not subject to compliance with the financial covenants 
pension benefits 
we maintain three defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of our us employees  excluding employees of our aerospace equipment segment the amended and restated american pacific corporation defined benefit pension plan  the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for salaried employees  and the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for bargaining unit employees  each as amended to date 
collectively  these three plans are referred to as the pension plans 
in may  our board of directors approved amendments to our pension plans which effectively closed the pension plans to participation by any new employees 
retirement benefits for existing us employees and retirees through june  were not affected by this change 
beginning july   new us employees began participating solely in one of the company s k plans 
pension plan benefits are paid based on an average of earnings  retirement age  and length of service  among other factors 
benefit obligations are measured annually as of september as of september   the pension plans had an unfunded benefit obligation of  for fiscal  we made contributions to the pension plans in the amount of  we anticipate making pension plan contributions in the amount of approximately  during fiscal we are required to make minimum contributions to our pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
in accordance with federal requirements  our minimum funding obligations are determined annually based on a measurement date of october the fair value of pension plan assets is a key factor in determining our minimum funding obligations 
holding all other variables constant  a decline in asset value as of september  would increase our minimum funding obligations for fiscal by approximately in addition  we maintain the american pacific corporation supplemental executive retirement plan  as amended and restated the serp  that includes five participants comprised of active and former executive officers 
the serp is an unfunded plan and as of september   the serp obligation was  for fiscal  we paid serp retirement benefits of we anticipate contributing the amount of approximately to the serp during fiscal for the payment of retirement benefits 
payments for retirement benefits should increase in future years when each of the three current active participants retires 
the future increase in such retirement benefits will be determined based on certain variables including each participating individual s actual retirement date  rate of compensation and years of service 
during fiscal and fiscal  our aggregate pension plans and serp liability increased significantly primarily due to reductions in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate on the obligation  returns on plan assets at levels substantially lower than the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and losses on certain plan assets 
these changes are recorded as an increase in pension obligations and a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in addition  the changes in actuarial assumptions and reduced asset performance have increased our anticipated pension funding during fiscal by approximately  if interest rates remain low and or returns on plan assets do not trend back to the expected long term rate of return  our liquidity could be further impacted by pension plan funding requirements 
environmental remediation ampac henderson site 
during the fiscal years ended september  and september   we recorded aggregate charges for  representing our then estimates of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at our former perchlorate chemicals manufacturing facility in henderson  nevada the ampac henderson site  including the costs for capital equipment and on going operating and maintenance o m 
late in fiscal  we gained additional information from groundwater modeling that indicates groundwater emanating from the ampac henderson site in certain areas in deeper zones more than feet below ground surface is moving toward our existing remediation facility at a much slower pace than previously estimated 
utilization of our existing facilities alone  at this lower groundwater pace  could  according to this groundwater model  extend the life of our remediation project to well in excess of fifty years 
as a result of this additional data  related model interpretations and consultations with the nevada division of environmental protection ndep  we re evaluated our remediation operations and determined that we should be able to improve the effectiveness of the treatment program and significantly reduce the total project time by expanding the then existing treatment system 
the expansion includes installing additional groundwater extraction wells in the deeper  more concentrated areas  construction of a pipeline to move extracted groundwater to our treatment facility  and the addition of fluidized bed reactor fbr bioremediation treatment equipment the expansion project that will enhance  and in some cases replace  primary components of the existing in situ bioremediation treatment system 
in our fiscal fourth quarter  we accrued  as our initial estimate of the capital cost of the expansion project and the related estimates of the effects of the enhanced operations on the on going o m costs and project life 
through june  and in cooperation with ndep  we worked to develop the formal design  engineering and permitting of the expansion project 
based on data obtained through that date  which was largely comprised of firm quotations  we determined that significant modifications to our fiscal assumptions were required 
as a result  in june  we accrued an additional  for the estimated increase in cost of the capital component of the expansion project  offset slightly by reductions in o m cost estimates 
the estimated capital costs of the expansion project increased by approximately  the increase reflects i an increase in the capacity of the fbr bioremediation treatment equipment to accommodate technical requirements based on the testing of new extraction wells in the fall of  and ii higher than initially anticipated cost associated with the installation of the equipment and construction of the pipeline 
our estimate of total o m costs was reduced by approximately this change in estimate reflects i a reduction in the estimated life of the project by four years  offset by ii an increase in the estimated annual o m cost to approximately  per year once the expansion project is placed in service 
we anticipate that the expansion project will be placed in service during fiscal due to uncertainties inherent in making estimates  our estimates of capital and o m costs may later require significant revision as new facts become available and circumstances change 
the estimated life of the project is a key assumption underlying the accrued estimated cost of our remediation activities 
groundwater modeling and other information regarding the characteristics of the surrounding land and demographics indicate that at our targeted processing rate of gallons per minute for the new groundwater extraction wells gallons per minute in the aggregate with existing wells  the life of the project could range from to years from the date that the expansion project is placed in service 
further  the data indicates that within that range  to years is the more likely range 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  if no point within the more likely range is considered more likely than another  then estimates should be based on the low end of the range 
accordingly  our accrued remediation cost includes estimated o m costs though  which is the low end of the likely range of the project life 
groundwater speed  perchlorate concentrations  aquifer characteristics and forecasted groundwater extraction rates will continue to be key factors considered when estimating the life of the project 
if additional information becomes available in the future that lead to a different interpretation of the model  thereby dictating a change in equipment and operations  our estimate of the resulting project life could change significantly 
the estimate of the annual o m cost of the project is a key assumption in our computation of the estimated cost of our remediation activities 
to estimate o m costs  we consider  among other factors  the project scope and historical expense rates to develop assumptions regarding labor  utilities  repairs  maintenance supplies and professional services costs 
if additional information becomes available in the future that is different than information currently available to us and thereby leads us to different conclusions  our estimate of o m expenses could change significantly 
in addition  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
as of september   the aggregate range of anticipated environmental remediation costs was from approximately  to approximately  this range represents a significant estimate and is based on the estimable elements of cost for capital and o m costs  and an estimated remaining operating life of the project through a range from the years to as of september   the accrued amount was  based on an estimated remaining life of the project through the year  or the low end of the more likely range of the expected life of the project 
cost estimates are based on our current assessments of the facility configuration 
as we proceed with the project  we have  and may in the future  become aware of elements of the facility configuration that must be changed to meet the targeted operational requirements 
certain of these changes may result in corresponding cost increases 
costs associated with the changes are accrued when a reasonable alternative  or range of alternatives  is identified and the cost of such alternative is estimable 
our estimated reserve for environmental remediation is based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
other arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
operating leases 
we lease our corporate offices and production facilities for our aerospace equipment segment under operating leases with lease periods extending through certain of our operating leases contain step rent provisions and escalation clauses and also provide for cash allowances toward the funding of capital improvements 
our minimum lease payments include these considerations 
minimum lease payments are recognized as rental expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
estimated future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of september   are as follows years ending september thereafter total letters of credit 
as of september   we had in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through july these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain water treatment equipment sold by us 
the letters of credit are collateralized by cash on deposit with the issuing bank in the amount of of the outstanding letters of credit 
collateral deposits are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
employee agreements 
we have an employment agreement with our chief executive officer 
the term of the employment agreement currently ends on september   unless amended or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salary  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
the employment agreement is primarily an at will employment agreement  under which we may terminate the executive officer s employment for any or no reason 
generally  the agreement provides that a termination without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
we maintain severance agreements with each of our vice president  administration and our chief financial officer  which  generally  provide that a termination of the executive without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under all of these agreements and arrangements was approximately  as of september  inflation 
generally  inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgment  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition 
revenues from our specialty chemicals segment  fine chemicals segment  and other businesses segment are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods 
specifically  these customers have contractually negotiated acceptance periods from the time they receive certificates of analysis and compliance certificates to reject the material based on issues with the quality of the product  as defined in the applicable agreement 
at times we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance 
if we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenue upon delivery of the product and recognize revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemicals products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities bill and hold transactions or arrangements 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the applicable revenue recognition criteria  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
for our bill and hold arrangements that contain customer acceptance periods  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues when such products are available for delivery and certificates have been delivered to the customers 
we recognize revenue on our bill and hold transactions in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
the sales value of inventory  subject to bill and hold arrangements  at our facilities was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
contract revenues include change orders and claims when approved by the customer 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
we do not incur material pre contract costs 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets 
our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the asset s estimated economic useful life or the lease term  if the asset is subject to a capital lease 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
to test for recovery  we group assets an asset group in a manner that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups are typically identified by facility because each facility has a unique cost overhead and general and administrative expense structure that is supported by cash flows from products produced at the facility 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
if we determine that an asset group is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
some of the factors that management would consider or estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we would use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
when we review asset groups for recoverability  we also consider depreciation estimates and methods or the amortization period  in each case as required by applicable accounting standards 
any revision to the remaining useful life of a long lived asset resulting from that review also is considered in developing estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset group for recoverability 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of september  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill  and  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount of goodwill in excess of its implied fair value 
environmental costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms and consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recoveries of the amounts are probable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  separately for each tax paying entity in each tax jurisdiction  using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
when measuring deferred tax assets  we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established by evaluating both positive and negative factors 
this evaluation requires that we exercise judgment in determining the relative significance of each factor 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the assessment of valuation allowance requirements  if any  involves significant estimates regarding the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we rely on deferred tax liabilities in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets if the temporary timing difference is anticipated to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and the deferred tax liabilities are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
we weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is required 
greater weight is given to evidence which is objectively verifiable such as historical results 
if we report a cumulative loss for a three year period  we do not rely on forecasted improvements in earnings to recover deferred tax assets 
for our us tax jurisdictions  negative evidence includes  but is not limited to  our reported book losses before income taxes in recent periods 
in contemplating this evidence we have taken into consideration that a significant portion of such losses occur from environmental remediation charges 
significant positive evidence includes  but is not limited to  our historical longer term trend of profitable operations  our forecast of future taxable income  the very long term nature of our significant deferred tax assets which are primarily associated with inventory  pension and remediation deductions  long carryforward periods for net operating loss carryforwards  and the lack of reliance on success in implementing tax planning strategies 
further  we do not have a history of tax credits expiring unused 
as of september   we have recorded valuation allowances for us tax jurisdictions in the amount of  recovery of the net remaining us deferred tax asset balance as of september   requires that we generate approximately  in taxable income over the next year period 
for foreign tax jurisdictions  the most compelling negative evidence is a history of unprofitable operations 
accordingly  we have fully reserved our foreign deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with an accounting standard which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the standard also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this standard  we may recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits 
we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
applicable accounting standards require that we make assumptions and use statistical variables in actuarial models to calculate our pension obligations and the related periodic pension expense 
the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
additional assumptions include the future rate of compensation increases  which is based on historical plan data and assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of projected future pension payments to all participants 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on aaa aa rated corporate long term bonds 
at september of each year  the discount rate is determined using bond yield curve models matched with the timing of expected retirement plan payments 
our discount rate assumption was percent as of september  holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the plan funds invested in a specific target asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return assumption on pension plan assets was percent in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately recently issued or adopted accounting standards 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone under topic and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones that should be evaluated individually 
this standard became effective for us beginning on october  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
that affects entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in the asu modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this standard became effective for us beginning on october  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amends topic  comprehensive income 
the amendment allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this standard is effective for us beginning on october  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amended topic  intangibles  goodwill and other 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this standard becomes effective for our annual and interim period goodwill impairment tests performed in our fiscal year beginning on october  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
