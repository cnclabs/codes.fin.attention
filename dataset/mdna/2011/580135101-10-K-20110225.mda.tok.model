item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   were franchised or licensed including  franchised to conventional franchisees   licensed to developmental licensees and  licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates primarily japan and  were operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this maintains long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees 
in certain circumstances  the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  and the company has no capital invested 
in addition  the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and or franchise restaurants within a market 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great  locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability 
however  directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants 
we continually review  and as appropriate adjust  our mix of company operated and franchised conventional franchised  developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 
the company s revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees 
revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments  and initial fees 
revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales  and generally include initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment  if any  and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
the united kingdom uk  france and germany  collectively  account for over of europe s revenues  and china  australia and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for over of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately of total revenues 
the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald s restaurant business as we believe significant opportunities remain for long term growth 
accordingly  in  the company sold its minority ownership interest in redbox automated retail  llc redbox for total consideration of million 
in  the company sold its minority ownership interest in uk based pret a manger for cash proceeds of million 
in connection with both sales  the company recognized nonoperating gains 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures  including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth  systemwide sales growth and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the company s underlying business trends 
comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions  respectively  from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  road construction and natural disasters 
comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts 
the company refers to these impacts as calendar shift trading day adjustments 
in addition  the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts 
these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 
in  there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants  whether operated by the company or by franchisees 
while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base 

table of contents return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success 
this business model enables mcdonald s to deliver consistent  locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to identify  implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences 
mcdonald s customer focused plan to win which concentrates on being better  not just bigger provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation 
through the execution of initiatives surrounding the five elements of our plan to win people  products  place  price and promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last seven years 
this plan  combined with financial discipline  has delivered strong results for our shareholders 
we have exceeded our long term  constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan s implementation in  after adjusting for the loss in from the latin america developmental license transaction 
given the size and scope of our global business  we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time  keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long term benefit of our system 
in  we continued to enhance the customer experience by remaining focused on the company s key global success factors of branded affordability  menu variety and beverage choice  convenience including daypart expansion  ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence 
initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting informal eating out ieo market in many countries 
as a result  every area of the world contributed to global comparable sales and guest counts  which increased and  respectively 
growth in comparable sales is driven by the system s ability to optimize guest count growth  product mix shifts and menu price changes 
pricing actions reflect local market conditions  with a view to preserving and improving margins  while continuing to drive guest counts and market share gains 
in general  the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution of price and guest counts to comparable sales growth 
in the us  we grew sales  guest counts  market share and restaurant cash flow  with comparable sales increasing for the th consecutive year  rising in these positive results were achieved despite a declining ieo market 
this performance was attributed to several factors including core menu items like chicken mcnuggets and burgers  everyday affordability and value options  such as the breakfast dollar menu  additions to the mccaf beverage line  new snack offerings and limited time offerings such as the mcrib sandwich 
the national launch of mccaf frapp s and real fruit smoothies provided a meaningful extension to the mccaf line that was well received by customers 
extending the snack wrap line with the angus snack wraps allowed customers to enjoy popular mcdonald s burgers in a smaller  more portable fashion 
complementing these menu offerings were our convenient locations  efficient drive thru service and value oriented local beverage promotions 
we broadened our accessibility through greater hour operations and offered customers free wi fi in over  restaurants 
modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the extension of our interior and exterior reimaging program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants 
in europe  comparable sales rose  marking the th consecutive year of comparable sales increases 
major contributors were france  the uk  russia and germany 
this performance reflected europe s strategic priorities of upgrading the customer and employee experience  increasing local relevance  and building brand transparency 
initiatives surrounding these platforms included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices  menu variety including limited time offerings  new dessert options  and reimaging almost  restaurants 
we expanded our coffee business and have nearly  mccaf locations  which in europe generally represent a separate area inside the restaurant that serves specialty coffees  indulgent desserts and light snacks 
the expansion of self order kiosks in france  germany and spain and the roll out of the new drive thru customer order display system in over  restaurants enhanced service 
in addition  we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended hours 
we built upon the momentum of portable menu offerings with the introduction of mcwraps larger sized beef and chicken wraps in germany  and p tit plaisir offerings in france 
finally  we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald s food and our sustainable business initiatives 
in apmea  our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales  led by japan  australia and china 
comparable sales rose through strategies emphasizing value  core menu extensions  breakfast and convenience 
australia launched family dinner boxes featuring popular menu items bundled together at a discounted price while china and japan concentrated on affordability with value lunch platforms 
new menu items such as a third angus burger option in australia and the extension of the spicy wings line in china were popular with consumers 
japan executed a successful us themed burger promotion and a chicken festival promotion featuring several products 
our dessert strategy is introducing consumers to the mcdonald s brand with products such as mcflurries and dessert kiosks in china  where we have become one of the largest retailers of ice cream 
our breakfast business continues to develop and is now offered in approximately of apmea restaurants 
in japan  value breakfast items  including the sausage mcmuffin and mcgriddle  were rotated across several months  while australia launched new breakfast menu items 

table of contents nearly two thirds of apmea restaurants are now offering some form of extended hours and over  restaurants are open hours 
delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now in approximately  restaurants  including nearly in china 
we continue to offer value to our customers by utilizing a strategic menu pricing tool that optimizes price  product mix  and promotions 
this approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale  supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices 
our ability to execute our strategies successfully in every area of the world  grow comparable sales  leverage a low commodity cost environment and control selling  general administrative expenses resulted in consolidated combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues of in  an improvement of percentage points over in  strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations  which rose million to billion 
our substantial cash flow  strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders 
capital expenditures of approximately billion were invested in our business primarily to open and reimage restaurants 
across the system  nearly  restaurants were opened and nearly  existing locations were reimaged 
we returned billion to shareholders consisting of billion in dividends and nearly billion in share repurchases 
cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner operators provides a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs 
in addition  the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the company owned model 
we believe locally owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage  making mcdonald s not just a global brand  but also a locally relevant one 
highlights from the year included comparable sales grew and guest counts rose  building on increases of and  respectively 
revenues increased in constant currencies

in addition  we will communicate our efforts to preserve the environment through our sustainable business initiatives 
our european business in faces some headwinds from government initiated austerity measures being implemented in many countries

in china  we will continue to build a foundation for long term growth by increasing our base of restaurants by approximately in toward our goal of nearly  restaurants by the end of convenience initiatives include expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours 
mcdonald s has an ongoing commitment to optimize our restaurant ownership structure 
a heavily franchised  less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow  the amount of capital we invest and long term returns 
we continue to maintain a strong culture of financial discipline by effectively managing all spending in order to maximize business performance 
in making capital allocation decisions  our goal is to elevate the mcdonald s experience by driving sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns 
we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases 
mcdonald s does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share 
the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately percentage points to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to the net traditional restaurants added in the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the us or europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about cents 
with about of mcdonald s grocery bill comprised of different commodities  a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company s commodity costs 
for the full year  the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase in the us and to increase in europe as compared to some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to decrease  in constant currencies  partly due to higher incentive compensation in based on performance 
in addition  fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in  such as the vancouver winter olympics in february and the biennial worldwide owner operator convention in april 
based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense for the full year to increase approximately compared with a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  australian dollar  british pound and canadian dollar 
collectively  these currencies represent approximately of the company s operating income outside the us if all four of these currencies moved by in the same direction  the company s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about cents 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to 
some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
about half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants 
the company expects to open about  restaurants including about restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets  such as japan and latin america  where the company does not fund any capital expenditures 
the company expects net additions of about traditional restaurants 
the remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants 
over half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage approximately  locations worldwide  some of which will require no capital investment from the company

over the past three years  the company has continued to optimize its restaurant ownership mix  cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy

supplemental information regarding company operated restaurants we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance  profits and returns 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals  but as previously stated  company operated restaurants are also important to our success 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalty rates may also vary by market 
as shown in the following table  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses  and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted previously  we do not allocate selling  general administrative expenses to our company operated business 
however  we believe that a range of  to  per restaurant  on average  is a typical range of costs to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

this adjustment is made to reflect expense in store operating margin and income in brand real estate margin

selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were in compared with in and in selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were in compared with in and in management believes that analyzing selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales  as well as revenues  is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants 

table of contents impairment and other charges credits  net the company recorded impairment and other charges credits  net of million in  million in and million in management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results

the company s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market 
resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business 
the company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in compared with and primarily as a result of selling less company operated restaurants to franchisees 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the company actively participates  but does not control 
the company records equity in earnings from these entities representing mcdonald s share of results 
for foreign affiliated markets primarily japan results are reported after interest expense and income taxes 
mcdonald s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the us is reported before income taxes 
these partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and  therefore  are classified as conventional franchised restaurants

the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments  but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments

other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  which impact the assumed fair value  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment 
table of contents charges 
based on the annual goodwill impairment test  conducted in the fourth quarter  the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 
litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
in  the internal revenue service irs concluded its field examination of the company s us federal income tax returns for and as part of this exam  the company resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the irs 
the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant 
the company continues to disagree with the irs proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about million  excluding interest and potential penalties 
the company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified  and intends to pursue all available remedies 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution  however  the company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows 
during  the irs examination of the company s and us federal income tax returns was completed 
the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant 
the irs examination of the company s and us federal income tax returns is expected to begin in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 
the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market  latin america developmental license  pret a manger and redbox transactions 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average
