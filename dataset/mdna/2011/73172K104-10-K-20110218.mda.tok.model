overview we are a global leader in unified communications uc solutions and the leading provider of telepresence  video  voice and infrastructure solutions based on open standards 
with our uc solutions  people all over the world can collaborate face to face without being in the same physical location 
individuals and teams can connect  solve and create through a highly visual experience from their desktops  meeting rooms  classrooms  and while mobile 
ultimately  this allows people to make better decisions faster and to increase their productivity while saving time and money and being environmentally responsible 
important drivers for the adoption of polycom uc solutions include the growth of video as a preferred method of communication everywhere  increasing presence of video on the desktop  virtualization and the move to the cloud  adoption of uc by small and medium businesses  mobile devices playing a more important role in uc  
table of contents the growing number of teleworkers  the demand for uc solutions for business to business communications and the move of consumer applications into the business space  and the continued commitment by organizations and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and expenses by choosing remote connectivity over travel 
in  we made strategic investments and executed on five key strategic initiatives to capture the uc collaboration market opportunity and to optimize our position as the partner of choice for global communications providers and as the provider of choice for our customers 
these initiatives included enhancements to our go to market capability  building our strategic partnerships with companies such as avaya  broadsoft  hp  ibm  juniper  microsoft and siemens  focusing on service providers enhanced sell through  as well as developing specific products and services to support their growing offerings in the managed and hosted space  further innovation surrounding our telepresence products and other solutions  and expansion of our professional services practice 
in the fourth quarter of  we made organizational changes which resulted in changes to the way in which we manage and evaluate our business from product line focused to geographically focused 
we conduct our business globally and are managed geographically in three segments the americas  emea and apac 
revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over the increase in revenues is due in part to improvements in global economic conditions  which negatively impacted our revenues in and resulted in the decline of our revenues year over year in each quarter through the third quarter of we have grown sequentially since the first quarter of and have grown year over year each quarter since the fourth quarter of the increase in revenues reflects increases in revenues across all three of our segments in as compared to which were driven by investments made in our go to market capabilities and improvement in global economic conditions 
our americas  emea and apac segment revenues  which accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenues in  increased by  and respectively  as compared to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin and segment accounts receivable 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is also followed by a discussion of results of operations by segment for the three years ended december  gross margins increased by percentage points in as compared to due primarily to higher sales volumes  better management of overhead costs and increased use of ocean freight which lowered the cost of product revenues 
this was partially offset by decreased margins from our services revenues as a result of investments made to expand our professional services practice as well as an increase in the mix of professional services revenues as a percentage of our total services revenues 
generally  professional services have a lower gross margin than our maintenance services 
operating margins increased in over primarily as a result of higher gross margins which were partially offset by operating expenses increasing as a percentage of revenues 
we significantly increased our spending levels in sales and marketing and  to a lesser extent  research and development and general and administrative areas  in support of our five key strategic initiatives 
this increased investment level lowered profits in the beginning of and began to yield growth in both our revenues and profitability in the second half of during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities which  after the impact of investing  share repurchases and other financing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net decrease in our total cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents moving forward into  we have developed a strategic plan aimed at capitalizing on our unique position and capturing the emerging network effect of uc adoption by enterprise  public sector  service providers  smbs  and  ultimately  the connected home 
central to our plan are five strategic pillars enabling cloud based uc solutions  mobile uc solutions  leveraging our uc ecosystem partners  the delivery and propagation of our uc intelligent core products  and continued delivery of solutions through our uc innovation engine 
these strategic pillars will drive our key initiatives and spending in as we focus on capturing opportunities within emerging and high growth markets including mobile  small and medium businesses  cloud based delivery  and the consumer markets

table of contents revenues we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis  organized into three geographic segments 
our net revenues  which include product and service revenues  for each segment are summarized in the following table year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands americas of revenues emea of revenues apac of revenues total revenues total revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over  driven by increases in both product and services revenues 
product revenues increased by million or and services revenue increased by million or in as compared with the increase in revenues primarily reflected increases in revenues across all segments in as compared with as a result of investments made in our go to market capabilities and improved global economic conditions in which increased sales volumes while average selling prices remained relatively stable 
our americas  emea and apac segment revenues increased by million or  million or and million or  respectively in as compared to these increases were driven by increased revenues across many of our key geographic markets  including the united states  china  france  germany  russia  singapore  the united kingdom and australia 
total revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or  over the decrease in revenues primarily reflects a decrease in sales volumes as a result of global economic conditions 
product revenue decreased by million or while services revenue increased by million or in as compared with our americas and emea segment revenues decreased by million or and million or  respectively  while our apac segment revenues increased by million or in as compared to these decreases were across most of our key geographic markets  especially in the united states 
however  revenues in a few countries such as china  canada and france actually increased 
in and  one channel partner in our americas segment accounted for more than of our total net revenues 
no one channel partner accounted for more than of our revenues in we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 

table of contents in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis  we also track revenues by groups of similar products and services for various purposes 
the following table presents revenues for groups of similar products and services year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands uc group systems uc personal devices network infrastructure total revenues uc group systems include all immersive telepresence  group video and group voice systems products and the related service elements 
the increase in uc group systems of million or in over was primarily driven by increases in sales of our group video and group voice products and services in all our geographic segments 
the decrease in uc group systems of million or in over was driven by decreased group voice sales in all segments  and  to a lesser extent  decreases in group video sales  primarily in the americas and emea  due primarily to general economic conditions 
uc personal devices include desktop video devices  desktop voice and wireless lan products and the related service elements 
the increase in uc personal devices of million or in over was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop voice products in all our geographic segments  driven by the continued adoption of voip 
the decrease in uc personal devices of million or in as compared to was primarily due to decreased sales of our wireless products and services across all segments  due primarily to general economic conditions 
network infrastructure includes our network infrastructure hardware and software products and the related service elements 
the increase in network infrastructure of million or in over was driven by increased revenues from our network infrastructure products in all our segments 
the increase in network infrastructure of million or in over was primarily driven by adoption of our newer rmx platform  where rmx units comprised the majority of network infrastructure hardware shipped in cost of revenues and gross margins year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands product cost of revenues of product revenues pts pt product gross margins pts pt service cost of revenues of service revenues pts pts service gross margins pts pts total cost of revenues of total revenues pts pt total gross margin pts pt cost of product revenues and product gross margins cost of product revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty 
table of contents payments  amortization of certain intangible assets  stock based compensation costs and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
cost of product revenues and product gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cost of product revenues at the segment level consists of the standard cost of product revenues and does not include items such as warranty expense  royalties  and the allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
overall  product gross margins increased by percentage points in as compared to  due to higher sales volumes  better management of overhead costs and increased use of ocean freight in which lowered the cost of product revenues 
overhead absorption costs and other cost of sales such as freight  warranty and royalties are not allocated to our segments 
product gross margin remained flat in our americas segment and decreased in both our emea and apac segments 
the decrease in emea segment gross margins was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations in british pounds 
the decrease in apac segment gross margins was primarily due to a shift in product mix and increased discounting 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to due primarily to lower gross margins in our americas and emea segments due to global economic conditions resulting in lower revenues and increased discounting 
gross margins in our apac segment increased in as compared to primarily due to mix of revenues toward products with higher gross margins 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were significantly higher than the december  levels and inventory turns decreased from turns at december  to turns at december  the increase in inventory and a decrease in inventory turns reflect our desire to shorten lead times in fulfilling orders and greater use of ocean freight 
inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
our inventory turns may also decrease in the future as a result of the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
we expect product gross margins to remain relatively flat in the near term 
forecasting future product gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchase price variances  warranty and recall costs and timing of sales can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
overall  service gross margins decreased by percentage points in over primarily as a result of investments made to expand our professional services practice as well as an increase in the mix of professional services revenues as a percentage of our total services revenues 
generally  professional services have a lower overall gross margin than our maintenance services 

table of contents overall  service gross margins increased in over primarily as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than the related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin rmx revenues 
in addition  the increase in our services revenues as a percentage of total revenues contributed to the overall decrease in gross margins in as compared to  as service gross margins are lower than our product gross margins 
forecasting future service gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future pricing and or potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related attach rates for new service as well as maintenance renewal rates  the utilization of our professional services personnel as we develop our professional services practice and as we make investments to expand our professional services offerings as part of our recently announced strategic investment plan  our ability to achieve greater efficiencies in the installations of our rpx telepresence product  increasing costs for freight and repair costs  and the timing of sales can cause our cost of services revenues percentage to vary from quarter to quarter 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues p ts p t sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  including stock based compensation costs  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing expenses  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
sales and marketing expenses  except for direct sales and marketing expenses  are not allocated to our segments 
sales and marketing expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage points and increased in absolute dollars by in as compared to  due primarily to increased headcount and compensation related costs  including commissions and stock based compensation charges  as a result of investments made in our go to market strategy in which resulted in sales and marketing headcount increasing by approximately in over depreciation and facilities allocations also increased as a result of headcount increases  as well as due to the expansion of our demonstration center capabilities in support of our go to market strategy 
other factors contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expenses included increased travel and entertainment expenses and recruitment and training costs as a result of increased headcount  increased spending on marketing programs  and the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage point in as compared to  due primarily to lower revenue due to the global economic conditions 
sales and marketing expense decreased in absolute dollars in over due primarily to a decrease in compensation costs  primarily commissions  as a result of decreases in revenue  lower travel and entertainment expenses  reduced spending on marketing programs  as well as decreased recruitment and training costs  partially offset by increased spending on demonstration equipment and facilities 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as a result of incurring costs to recruit and hire new sales and marketing personnel  and expenses will also likely increase in the future as revenues increase 
we will also make additional investments in sales and marketing in 
table of contents order to extend our market reach and grow our business in support of our key initiatives surrounding increasing our strategic partnerships as part of our uc ecosystem and developing and marketing cloud based and mobile uc solutions  our uc intelligent core and other innovations that are expected throughout forecasting sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products and also depending upon the timing of trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
research and development expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development costs are not allocated to our segments 
research and development expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in by million or  while remaining flat as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to increased headcount and increased development expenses in support of our strategic investment plan 
research and development expenses also increased as a result of the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of and increased stock based compensation charges 
research and development expenses decreased for by million or  and as a percentage of revenue by percentage point  as compared to the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily due to decreases in headcount and decreased program development expenses in order to control costs 
stock based compensation costs also decreased million in over in addition  we continued to increase the percentage of our research and development being performed in lower cost jurisdictions 
we believe that innovation and technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures  such as the new svc standard to address the device  application and networks requirements of mobile  smb and consumer networks 
we are also investing more heavily in research and development as a result of increased business opportunities with strategic partners  mobile and service provider customers as a result of our key strategic initiatives in these areas 
we are also investing in key vertical markets such as the us federal government 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities in any given quarter 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues 
table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  litigation costs and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are not allocated to our segments 
general and administrative expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december     respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars and remained flat as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to primary drivers of the increase were related to increased stock based compensation charges in over and severance  legal and other costs associated with the ceo transition that occurred in may general and administrative expenses also increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased legal fees and other outside services  and to a lesser extent  increases in headcount and headcount related expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased in absolute dollars while remaining flat as a percentage of revenue as compared to the decrease in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased compensation charges  reductions in outside services and travel and training costs and reduced bad debt expenses 
significant future charges due to costs associated with litigation or uncollectability of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the near term but could fluctuate as we make investments in enhancements to our financial and operating systems and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and our continued investments in international regions 
general and administrative expenses may also increase as a result of additional investments required to support our key strategic initiatives 
amortization of purchased intangibles in   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  for amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in  and  we recorded amortization totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to eight years 
the amortization of purchased intangibles in remained relatively consistent with that in the prior year as there were no additions  impairments or changes to useful lives recognized during either or that could increase or decrease the amortization expense amount 
the decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles recorded as operating expenses in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to lower amortization as a result of certain intangibles acquired in the voyant and dstmedia acquisitions becoming fully amortized at the end of we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted 
table of contents future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
no impairment charges were recognized for all periods presented 
at december  and  the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million and million  respectively 
restructure costs in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
these actions are generally intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in  these actions were designed to reallocate our resources to more strategic growth areas of the business and resulted in elimination of certain positions while enabling the hiring of additional positions to better align with the execution of our strategic initiatives 
in  these actions were designed to reduce our cost structure while maintaining flexibility to invest in the strategic growth areas of the business 
in  these actions were intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructure costs 
in february  management committed to a restructuring plan designed to align various organizations under our new executive leadership and to reallocate resources to more strategic growth areas of the business 
the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately of our global workforce with most of the reductions taking effect immediately  enabling the hiring of new positions to better align with the execution of our strategic initiatives 
we currently expect to record restructuring charges and make cash expenditures between approximately million and million in the first quarter of resulting from this action  primarily related to severance and other employee termination benefits 
additional charges of approximately million related to the consolidation of our colorado development facilities will be recorded in the second quarter of upon vacating our existing site 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
litigation reserves and payments during  we recorded million in litigation reserves and payments in the consolidated statements of operations related to the settlement of a legal matter during the period and million during related to a legal matter which has subsequently been settled 
during  we recorded charges totaling million as a result of trial preparation costs and the fee arrangement we had with our outside legal counsel that represented us in our litigation against codian  pursuant to which we owed additional legal fees based upon the favorable outcome that was achieved in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and could result in charges that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts  gains and losses on investments  non income related taxes and fees and foreign exchange related gains and losses 
interest and other income expense  net  was a net expense of million and million in and  respectively  and a net income of million in the increase in net expense in over was primarily due to net losses realized on the sale of investments in  an increase in non income related taxes and fees in as compared to and the write off of a non trade note receivable in there were no such investment losses or non trade receivable write offs during the increase in net expense was partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses recognized in as compared to interest and other income expense  net was a net expense of million in as compared to a net income of million in the change was primarily due to lower interest income and lower average investment returns and for and  respectively  partially offset by lower foreign exchange related losses  a decrease in non income related taxes and license fees and investment losses recorded in that were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
there were no such impairment losses during interest and other income expense  net will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and returns on our cash and investments  any future impairment of investments  foreign currency rate fluctuations on un hedged exposures  fluctuations in costs associated with our hedging program and timing of non income related taxes and license fees 
the cash balance could also decrease depending upon the amount of cash used in any future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors  which would also impact our interest income 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  the reenactment and increase of us research and development tax credits  and an increase in the release of tax reserves  related interest and penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions which amounted to million in as compared to million in the increase in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily related to lower releases of tax reserves  related interest and penalties in of million as compared to when we released million in tax reserves  related interest and penalties  all due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in both the u 
s and various foreign jurisdictions 
partially offsetting the effect of the change in the release of the tax reserves was a relative increase in foreign earnings in which are subject to lower tax rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of tax effected non us net operating losses  million in tax effected us capital loss carryforwards and million in tax effected us credit carryovers  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
in addition  at december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in denmark 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in  the california franchise tax board completed its audit of the and tax years 
the audit resulted in a payment of million 
certain other audit issues were also settled during the year resulting in the release of accrued taxes of million 
additionally  million in tax reserves related to the cost sharing of stock based compensation were released as an adjustment to stockholders equity  million in tax reserves were released due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year  and million in tax reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations or the resolution of audits in various tax jurisdictions 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
we are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities  and in some cases we have received additional tax assessments 
currently  certain tax years are under audit by the relevant tax authorities  including an examination of our us federal tax returns for the calendar years and and a limited review of our u 
s federal tax returns for calendar years and we anticipate that the irs audit of and and the limited review of and will be concluded in the next months 
segment information during the fourth quarter of  we made organizational changes which resulted in changes to the way in which we manage and evaluate our business from product line based reporting video communication solutions  voice communication solutions and services to geographically based americas  emea and apac 
a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and as a result of the change in segments  the revenue and operating results for the prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales and direct marketing and sales expenses 
management allocates some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include corporate manufacturing costs  sales and marketing costs other than direct sales and marketing  stock based compensation costs  research and development costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  restructuring costs  and interest and other income expense  net

we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period

table of contents apac year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of apac revenue pt pt our apac segment revenues increased by in as compared with primarily due to investments made in our go to market capabilities and an improved economic environment  which resulted in increased demand for our products and services 
revenues from china  singapore  australia  japan and india contributed to the strong growth in apac 
the increase in revenues was driven by increases in our uc group systems  network infrastructure  and uc personal devices revenues 
increases in uc group systems revenues in apac was primarily driven by increased group video revenues  and to a lesser extent  increased group voice revenues and increased immersive telepresence revenues 
increases in uc personal devices revenues were primarily driven by increased desktop voice sales resulting from continued adoption of voip 
network infrastructure revenues growth was as a result of increased sales of the products and services that comprise our uc intelligent core 
our apac segment revenues increased by in as compared with primarily due to earlier recoveries to the economic conditions in some of the major countries within the region as compared to our other segments 
although general economic conditions resulted in lower uc group systems and uc personal devices revenues in as compared to  the increase in network infrastructure revenues more than offset these decreases

contribution margin as a percentage of apac segment revenues was in as compared to in the contribution margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower gross margins 
direct sales and marketing expenses  while increasing in absolute dollars  remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues 
the decrease in gross margins was driven primarily by changes in product mix and lower average selling prices due to increased discounting 
contribution margin as a percentage of apac segment revenues was in as compared to in the increase in contribution margin in was primarily due to higher gross margins  partially offset by higher direct sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
gross margins increased primarily as a result of improved product mix toward higher margin products 
direct sales and marketing expenses increased due to investments made to support our go to market initiative 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government and agency securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our short term and long term investments 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  the majority of which are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements 
our total cash and cash equivalents and investments held in the united states totaled million as of december   and the remaining million was held by various foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 

table of contents if we would need to access our cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in order to fund acquisitions  share repurchases or our working capital needs  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  a higher increase in accounts receivable  a lower increase in accounts payable and to a lesser extent  an increase in deferred taxes 
partially offsetting these negative effects were increases in other accrued liabilities  non cash expenses and net income 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to decreased inventory  decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and increased accounts payable  and a larger decrease in deferred taxes 
partially offsetting these positive effects were decreased net income and non cash expenses  an increase in trade receivables and a smaller increase in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was a decrease of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities and million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of investments  net of proceeds from investments and million for purchases of property and equipment 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  we expect that dso will remain in the to day range but could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  an increase in international receivables which typically have longer payment terms and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities which also have customarily longer payment terms 
dso could be negatively impacted if our partners experience difficulty in financing purchases  which results in delays in payment to us 
inventory turns decreased from turns at december  to turns at december  the decrease in inventory turns was a result of the increase in our finished goods inventory levels at the end of compared to the end of the increase in inventory and a decrease in inventory turns reflect our desire to shorten lead times in fulfilling orders and greater use of ocean freight 
we believe inventory turns will fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
our inventory turns may also decrease in the future as a result of the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business 
cash used for purchases of property and equipment increased significantly in to million as compared to million in as a result of our strategic investment plan  including upgrading our enterprise resource planning erp systems and adding expanding our demonstration centers 
we expect our purchases of property and equipment in to increase from the levels in continued support of our strategic investments and as our business grows 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded in interest and other income expense  net  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  our hedging costs can vary depending on the size of our hedging program  on whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the us dollar and on interest rate spreads between the us and other foreign markets 

table of contents additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any excluded and ineffective portions of a hedging instrument would be recorded in interest and other income expense  net 
from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans for us to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for our common stock repurchases and the resultant accumulated deficit included in stockholder s equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million  the majority of which are used to secure the leases on some of our offices 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
total estimated sublease income is million and is netted in the amounts below 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments 
table of contents as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse in the applicable statutes of limitations or the resolution of audits in varying jurisdictions 
we anticipate the reduction in will approximate million and the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products ratably over the service period  generally one to five years 
some of our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through maintenance contracts 

table of contents in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling price esp of deliverables if a vendor does not first have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or secondly does not have third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after december  as a result  some of our products are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
a multiple element arrangement includes the sale of one or more tangible products with one or more associated services offerings  each of which are considered separate units of accounting 
beginning with new or materially modified arrangements as of january   we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the other revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
the adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance  which resulted in a million increase in revenues for the year ended december   did not have a material impact on our revenues or results of operations for the year ended december  we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense our share based compensation programs consist of grants of share based awards to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  as well as our employee stock purchase plan 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of these awards  including the effect of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of performance shares is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved 
compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes in the probable outcome of performance related conditions until the award vests 
the fair value of a performance share with a market condition is estimated on the date of award  using a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the total return ranking of our stock in relation to the target index of companies over each performance period 
changes in the underlying factors and assumptions utilized may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance primarily related to net operating losses generated in denmark 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be 
table of contents sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 
fair value fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as the basis for considering such assumptions  a three tier value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require us to develop our own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires us to use observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts 
our cash and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using inputs such as quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market funds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include us treasury securities and other government agencies  corporate bonds and commercial paper 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december  our fixed income available for sale securities include us treasury obligations and other government agency instruments  corporate bonds  commercial paper  municipal securities and money market funds 
included in available for sale securities are cash equivalents  which consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less and include money market funds 
the principal market where we execute our foreign currency contracts is the retail market in an over the counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency 
the market participants and our counterparties are large money center banks and regional banks 
our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources specifically  spot exchange rates  libor rates and credit default rates and do not involve management judgment 
these contracts are typically classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
for the fair value of our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from several months to eight years 
we annually assess whether any impairment indicators exist on purchased intangibles with finite lives 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
there was no impairment charge recorded in as no impairment indicators existed 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued an accounting update to provide guidance to enhance disclosures related to the credit quality of a company s financing receivables portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses 
pursuant to this accounting update  a company is required to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about its allowance for credit loss with the objective of facilitating users evaluation of the nature of credit risk inherent in its portfolio of financing receivables  how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
the revised disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for our fiscal year annual financial statements 
upon adoption  the application of the revised disclosures did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of these disclosures to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate debt securities  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  particularly in light of the recent credit market instability 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may realize losses on the sale of our investments or we may incur further temporary impairment charges requiring us to record additional unrealized losses in cumulative other comprehensive income loss 
we could also incur additional other than temporary impairment charges resulting in realized losses in our consolidated statements of operations which would reduce net income 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security or issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow any anticipated recovery in the market value 
further  if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale takes place 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
we model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps foreign currency exchange rate risk while the majority of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  we also sell our products and services in certain european regions in euros and in british pounds and incur expenses in israeli shekels  which has increased our risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires us to only enter into hedge contracts with banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 
as of december   we had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  million british pounds at and million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in days or less 
as of december   we also had net outstanding forward exchange 
table of contents contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at  and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
we also have a cash flow hedging program under which we hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound and israeli shekels 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and to buy million british pounds at and million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of less than days 
as of december   we also had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
