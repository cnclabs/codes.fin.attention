overview response genetics  inc the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on september  as bio type  inc for the purpose of providing unique molecular profiling services of tumor tissue that has been formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin wax 
in august  we changed our name to response genetics  inc in november  we established response genetics ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary in edinburgh  scotland 
on february  we implemented a reduction of workforce pursuant to which we closed our subsidiary in edinburgh

clinical studies have shown that not all cancer chemotherapy works effectively in every patient  and that a number of patients receive therapy that has no benefit to them and may potentially even be harmful 
our goal is to provide cancer patients and their physicians with a means to make informed  individualized treatment decisions based on genetic analysis of tumor tissues 
our pharmacogenomic analysis of clinical trial specimens for the pharmaceutical industry may provide data that will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis for response to specific drugs and  therefore lead to individualized treatment 
we are focusing our efforts in the following areas continued commercialization of our responsedx tests  developing additional diagnostic tests for assessing the risk of cancer recurrence  prediction of chemotherapy response and tumor classification in cancer patients  and expanding our pharmacogenomic testing services business into and creating a standardized and integrated testing platform in the major markets of the healthcare industry  including outside of the united states 
our patented technologies enable us to reliably and consistently extract the nucleic acids rna and dna from tumor specimens that are stored as formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  specimens and thereby to analyze genetic information contained in these tissues 
this is significant because the majority of patients diagnosed with cancer have a tumor biopsy sample stored in paraffin  while only a small percentage of patients tumor specimens are frozen 
our technologies also enable us to use the ffpe patient biopsies for the development of diagnostic tests 
to our knowledge  we were the first company to generate clinically relevant information regarding the risks of recurrence of cancer or chemotherapy response using approximately  genes available from microarray profiling of ffpe specimens 
responsedx the outcome of cancer chemotherapy is highly variable due to genetic differences among patients 
some patients respond well with tumor shrinkage and increase in life span 
other patients do not obtain benefit from the same therapy but may still experience toxic side effects as well as delay in effective treatment and psychological trauma 
at present most chemotherapy regimens are administered without any pre selection of patients on the basis of their particular genetics 
however recent development of very sensitive molecular technologies has enabled researchers to identify and measure genetic and biochemical factors in patients tissues that may predict the probability of success or failure of many currently used anti cancer agents 
in order to increase the chances of a better chemotherapy outcome for cancer patients  we are developing genetic tests that will measure predictive factors for tumor response in tumor tissue samples 
we have begun offering tests for non small cell lung cancer nsclc responsedx lung  colorectal cancer crc responsedx colon and gastric and gastroesophageal ge cancer responsedx gastric patients tumor tissue through our laboratory located in los angeles  california  which is certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia  and we anticipate offering additional tests for ovarian and pancreatic cancer in the future 
these tests are proprietary based tests which serve to help oncologists make optional therapeutic decisions for cancer patients 
the results from our tests may help oncologists choose among chemotherapy regimens to treat their cancer patients 
as of december   our recently formed sales team had been expanded to sales people located in the west coast  midwest  and east coast areas of the united states 
diagnostic tests for other cancers in addition to responsedx lung  responsedx colon  and responsedx gastric  we are developing and intend to commercialize tests for other types of cancer that identify genetic profiles of tumors that are more aggressive and recur rapidly after surgery 
we also are identifying genetic profiles of tumors that are more or less responsive to a particular chemotherapy 
following the development of tests to predict the risk of recurrence after surgery  we intend to develop tests to determine the most active chemotherapy regimen for the individual patient at risk 
once developed and after obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals  we intend to leverage our relationships in the healthcare industry to market  sell or license these tests as a means for physicians to determine the courses of cancer treatment 
expansion of our pharmacogenomic testing services business we have started the expansion of our pharmacogenomic testing services business into major markets of the healthcare industry outside of the united states 
we have a service laboratory in japan and in china  through collaboration with some of our current clients in the pharmaceutical industry 
the pharmaceutical industry is in need of standardized integrated worldwide analysis of clinical trial specimens 
it is important to the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agencies that the same analytical methods are used for each clinical trial sample around the world so that the data can be easily compared and used for global drug development 
also  export of clinical trial specimens to the united states is restricted from some areas of the world  such as china 
our goal is to offer an analysis of patient specimens and generate consistent data based on integrated common platforms and technology into the major markets of the healthcare industry including outside of the united states 
there are no assurances that we will be able to continue making our current responsedx tests available  or make additional responsedx tests available  will be able to develop and commercialize tests of other types of cancer  or will be able to expand our pharmacogenomic testing service business 
we anticipate that  over the next months  a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on research and development to expand our series of diagnostic tests for cancer patients  to establish a laboratory overseas in collaboration with certain of our current pharmaceutical clients  sales and marketing activities related to our responsedx diagnostic tests  and for other general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses represented and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
major components of the  and  in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  included supplies and reagents for our research activities  personnel costs  occupancy costs  equipment warranties and service  patent fees  insurance  business consulting and sample procurement costs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition pharmacogenomic revenue revenues that are derived from pharmacogenomic testing services provided to pharmaceutical companies are recognized on a contract specific basis pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded on an accrual basis as the contractual obligations are completed and as a set of assays is processed through the company s laboratory under a specified contractual protocol and are recorded on the date the tests are resulted 
certain contracts have minimum assay requirements that  if not met  result in payments that are due upon the completion of the designated period 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the end of the specified contract period is reached  if the minimum assay requirements are not met 
on occasion  the company may enter into a contract that requires the client to provide an advance payment for specimens that will be processed at a later date 
in these cases  the company records this advance as deferred revenue and recognizes the revenue as the specimens are processed or at the end of the contract period  as appropriate 
responsedx revenue effective april   the company recognizes all product revenue from its responsedx tests on an accrual basis 
through march   the company recognized revenue from private payors on a cash basis as the company had not  until then  established a collection history 
as of april   a pattern of collections had been established and the company began to record revenues from private payors of responsedx on an accrual basis 
for accounting purposes  the change from the cash basis to the accrual basis of recording revenue for responsedx tests paid by private payors  is considered a change in accounting estimate leading to a change in accounting principle 
the change in accounting estimate was derived from the establishment of a reasonable basis to estimate the amount to be collected from certain private payors 
this change in estimate resulted in the change in accounting principle from the cash basis to the accrual basis of revenue recognition for responsedx tests paid by private payors 
accordingly  the company has recorded in the second quarter a one time adjustment to increase revenue by  which represents the amount of responsedx tests completed in prior periods for which cash payment under the former revenue recognition method had not been received as of april  since all sales of response dx tests are on the accrual basis from april   the company does not expect any future one time adjustments to revenue 
the revenue recorded from responsedx sales to private payors for the period from april  to december  was  as a result of the conversion from the cash basis to the accrual basis of recording revenue for responsedx tests paid by private payors  the company recognized a total of  more in revenue during the year ended december   respectively  than it would have recognized had the company continued to recognize such amounts on the cash basis during this same period 
the company has its medicare provider number which allows it to invoice and collect from medicare 
invoicing to medicare is primarily based on amounts allowed by medicare for the service provided as defined by common procedural terminology cpt codes 
responsedx revenues related to medicare billings are recorded at established billing rates net of an estimated billing adjustment  based on reporting models utilizing historical cash collection percentages and updated for current effective reimbursement factors 
response dx revenue related to private payors are recorded at established billing rates less an allowance to reflect the revenue at the amounts expected based on historical collections patterns 
license fees we have licensed technology for the extraction of rna and dna from ffpe tumor specimens from usc in exchange for royalty fees on revenue generated by use of this technology 
these royalties are calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue that we generate from use of the technology licensed from usc 
total license fees expensed in cost of revenue under the royalty agreement to usc were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also maintain a non exclusive license to use roche s polymerase chain reaction pcr  homogenous pcr  and reverse transcription pcr processes 
we pay roche a fixed percentage royalty fee for revenue that we generate through use of this technology 
royalties expensed in cost of revenue under this agreement totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are subject to potentially significant variations in royalties recorded in any period 
while the amount paid is based on a fixed percentage from revenues of specific tests pursuant to terms set forth in the agreements with usc and roche  the amount due is calculated based on the revenue we recognize using the respective licensed technology 
as discussed above  this revenue can vary from period to period as it is dependent on the timing of the specimens submitted by our clients for testing 
accounts receivable we invoice our pharmaceutical clients as specimens are processed and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts with pharmaceutical clients typically require payment within days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends and changes in client payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
to date  our clients have primarily been large pharmaceutical companies 
as a result  bad debts to date have been minimal and there is no allowance for doubtful accounts for our pharmaceutical revenue at december  and we bill medicare and private payors for responsedx upon completion of the required testing services 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with medicare and private payors 
we continue to monitor the collection history for medicare and private payors 
based on the historical experience for our medicare and private payor accounts  we have determined that related accounts receivable associated with billings over one year old are unlikely to be collected 
therefore  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as of december  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
our management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods through future operating results 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the net carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income  based on management s estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions take into consideration future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in determining recoverability of such assets 
our valuation allowance is subject to significant change based on management s estimates of future profitability and the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets 
the company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
results of operations years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
revenues  excluding the net revenue impact of  resulting from the conversion to the accrual basis of revenue recognition for private payors  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase  excluding the net revenue impact of  for the year ended december   was due to increases in responsedx revenue of  and pharmaceutical revenues of  including the  out of period adjustment see note 
excluding the net revenue impact of  for the year ended december   responsedx revenue accounted for of total revenue compared to for the year ended december  excluding the net revenue impact of  responsedx revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   increased 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of our sales force and adding additional genes to our tests 
we expect that revenues will continue to increase as we add additional sales managers in for the year ended december   our two most significant pharmaceutical customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  as compared to approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  cost of revenue 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
to support the increase in revenue  the company hired additional lab personnel and temporary help  incurred additional costs for lab supplies  reagents and shipping costs 
specifically  the increase in cost of revenue resulted primarily from increases in personnel and temporary help costs of  lab supplies and reagent costs of  equipment service and repair costs of  consulting costs of  royalties of  third party hitachi chemical and shanghai bio processing costs of  and shipping costs of  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of 
excluding the net revenue impact of  resulting from the conversion to accrual for private payors  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in laboratory supplies  reagents and microarray costs of  personnel related costs of  and consulting costs of  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we work to develop additional aspects of our technology and to study diagnostic indicators for various forms of cancer 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increases in personnel costs of  legal costs primarily associated with the proxy activities of  business consulting costs of  billing service costs of  an impairment to property and equipment of  and bad debt expenses of  offset by a decrease in accounting service costs of  sales and marketing expenses 
for year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses totaled  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase primarily resulted from increased sales and marketing activities for responsedx  which included increases in personnel costs of  marketing and promotional costs of  and travel and meeting costs of  we expect that sales and marketing costs will continue to increase as we expand our sales and marketing activities in order to gain clinical acceptance of our responsedx assays 
united kingdom u 
k operating expenses 
in december   we made the decision to increase the operational efficiency of the company by consolidating our uk operations with our us operations 
on february   management implemented a reduction of workforce pursuant to which the company closed its uk testing facility to consolidate services at its clia certified laboratory facilities in los angeles 
this reduction did not affect our genetic testing services or current partnership agreements 
the reduction of workforce was substantially completed on march  and the lease for our uk testing facility expired on april  the operating costs related to our uk laboratory were  for the year ended december   which included redundancy costs of  incurred in connection with the reduction of workforce 
uk operating expenses were  for the year ended december  other income 
in  we applied and received a one time federal grant relating to qualified research and development activities 
the gross amount of the proceeds received was  this amount  net of  of related direct costs  is shown as other income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
interest income 
interest income was for the year ended december   compared with  for the same period in this  decrease was due to lower average cash balances and lower rates of interest during the year ending december  income taxes 
as of december  and  a full valuation allowance has been recorded for the net deferred tax assets since we do not believe the recoverability of the net deferred income tax assets in the near future is more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred net losses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
since our inception in september  we have incurred cumulative losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will likely incur additional losses for the next year 
we cannot provide assurance as to when we will achieve profitability 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund our selling and marketing activities primarily related to our responsedx tests  research and development  and general corporate purposes 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
management plans to effectively manage cash flows in and expects that cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements through the next months 
nevertheless  until we can generate and maintain sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance additional cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  strategic collaborations  and other financing opportunities as they may arise 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate selling and marketing activities or research and development programs 
in addition  we expect to use our capital to fund research and development and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale up our commercial operations 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  and the amount of cash used by operations 
we expect that we will continue to generate revenue through our pharmacogenomic testing services and through responsedx testing services business provided to pharmaceutical clients and to the users of our responsedx testing services which partially include oncologists  hospitals  and cancer care centers 
these revenues are not guaranteed and are not expected to substantially offset the costs associated with our expansion efforts 
following is a summary of recent events and the expected impact these events may or have had on our liquidity and future realization of revenues 
recent contract amendments in january  we amended our agreement with taiho and the agreement was renewed for an additional three years 
according to the terms of the renewal  taiho s appointment as an exclusive purchaser in japan of tests and testing services and its minimum purchasing obligations were extended through on september   the company amended and restated its master service agreement with glaxosmithkline biologicals gsk bio  the vaccine division of glaxosmithkline the amended and restated agreement 
pursuant to the amended and restated agreement  the parties agreed that gsk bio has accrued an aggregate credit under the terms of the original agreement  representing the balance of deferred revenue relating to this agreement at that date  which amount shall be allocated towards services rendered to gsk bio during the remaining term of the agreement as described below 
for each calendar quarter of and the first two quarters of   of the existing credit shall apply to all services rendered to gsk bio during such calendar quarter 
pursuant to the amended and restated agreement  in july of gsk bio extended the term of the agreement for an additional one year period through december  as the agreement was extended  the then remaining balance of the existing credit shall be divided into six equal quarterly amounts and apply to all services rendered to gsk bio in each of the last two quarters of and the four calendar quarters of in all cases  gsk bio shall remit payment to the company for all services rendered to gsk bio in any such calendar quarter that is in excess of the applicable credit amount 
in the event the amount of services rendered to gsk bio in a calendar quarter does not exceed the applicable credit amount  the existing credit for the following calendar quarter shall be increased by such unused amount 
the aggregate credit is included as part of deferred revenue 
the amended and restated agreement further provides that the company shall provide additional services on a fee for service basis  upon gsk bio s written request  relating to the bridging of assays diagnostic tests to third parties that develop  manufacture and sell the commercial diagnostic tests to be used with certain of gsk bio s products 
private placements under the company s articles of incorporation  the company has one class of common stock and its holders have no preemptive  subscription  redemption or conversion rights 
as more fully described in note  the company sold shares of its common stock during and in three private placements  as described below 
in connection with these private placements  the company entered into registration rights agreements with the purchasers of the common shares 
on february   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain affiliates of special situations funds for the private placement of  newly issued shares of the company common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on monday  march  and we received net proceeds of  on the same date 
in connection with the special situations funds private placement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated february   with the purchasers the registration rights agreement pursuant to which the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to register the  shares for resale  which registration statement became effective on june  the special situations registration rights agreement provides an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach  which allows the company to apply the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and compliance with all filing requirements under the act as described above was solely within the company s control 
as such  it allowed the company to include the  in the company s common stock as stockholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
common stock classified outside of stockholders equity deficit on july   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain funds of lansdowne partners limited for the private placement of  newly issued shares of the company common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on july  the aggregate offering price of the shares was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of the shares  the purchasers were granted certain preemptive rights permitting them to maintain their percentage ownership interests in connection with future issuances of the company s capital stock  subject to various exceptions and limitations 
we received the funds on july  pursuant to the lansdowne registration rights agreement which is dated july   the company filed a registration statement with the sec to register the  shares sold to lansdowne for resale  which became effective on november  and which registration statement is currently effective 
under the lansdowne registration rights agreement  the company was required to have the registration statement declared effective within days after the private placement closed 
in addition  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts i to cause the registration statement described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of the company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that that will terminate on the earlier of july  or the date on which lansdowne has sold all of its shares of common stock 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the lansdowne registration rights agreement  the company would be in breach of said agreement  in which event lansdowne would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
the lansdowne registration rights agreement does not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of the lansdowne registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying will all filing requirements under the act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company is required to present lansdowne s investment of  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
on march   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain affiliates of and funds managed by lansdowne partners limited partnership  greenway capital partners and paragon associates for the private placement of  newly issued shares of our common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on friday  march  in connection with the acquisition of the shares  the purchasers were granted certain preemptive rights permitting them to maintain their percentage ownership interests in connection with future issuances of our capital stock  subject to various exceptions and limitations 
lansdowne participated in the private placement by electing to exercise the preemptive rights granted to it pursuant to the purchase agreement by and between the company and lansdowne  dated july  net proceeds received from this financing were approximately  in connection with the private placement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated march   with the purchasers the registration rights agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to file  within days of the closing of the private placement  a registration statement with the sec to register the shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the closing 
we also granted certain piggyback registration rights to the purchasers which are triggered if we propose to file a registration statement for its own account or the account of one or more shareholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the shares or the shares become eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
under the registration rights agreements with the purchasers  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to i cause the registration statements described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that will terminate on the earlier of march  or the date on which the purchases have sold all shares of common stock 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company required of the company under the act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the registration rights agreements  the company would be in breach of said agreements  in which event  the purchases would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
these registration rights agreements do not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of these registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying with all filing requirements under the act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company is required to present the investment of  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
comparison of years ended december  and as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended december   the company used cash flows in operating activities of  compared to  used in the year ended december  the reasons for the decrease in cash used in operating activities of  was due mainly to the decrease in net loss and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses  accrued royalties and accrued payroll and related liabilities  offset by the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets  and the decrease in deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable related mainly to the increased revenue and accounts receivable from the conversion to accrual for private payors 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily resulted from increased sales and marketing and business development activities related to the growth of responsedx 
the increase in accrued royalties primarily related to the increased responsedx revenues subject to license fees in the increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities is primarily due to the increased number of employees at december  and accrued bonuses at december  the decrease in deferred revenue related to the revenue recognition of deferred revenue totaling  which includes an out of period adjustment of  see note 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was attributable to the need for property and equipment for our laboratory and new personnel 
cash flows used in financing activities cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december  and provided net cash of  and  respectively  primarily relating to the sale of common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets asu 
asu formally codifies sfas  accounting for transfers of financial assets 
asu eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity spe and removes the scope exception for a qualifying spe from asc  consolidations 
as a result  previously unconsolidated qualifying spes must be re evaluated for consolidation by the sponsor or transferor 
in addition  this accounting update amends the accounting guidance related to transfers of financial assets in order to address practice issues that have been highlighted by the events of the recent economic decline 
asu is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after november  the recognition and measurement provisions will be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date and all qualifying spes that exist on and after the effective date must be evaluated for consolidation 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu 
asu codifies sfas  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  and amends the consolidation guidance related to a variable interest entity vie 
primarily  the current quantitative analysis used under asc  consolidations  will be eliminated and replaced with a qualitative approach that is focused on identifying the variable interest that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the vie and absorb losses or receive returns that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in addition  this new accounting standard will require an ongoing reassessment of the primary beneficiary of the vie  rather than reassessing the primary beneficiary only upon the occurrence of certain pre defined events 
asu will be effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after november   and requires the reconsideration of all vies for consolidation in which an entity has a variable interest upon the effective date of these amendments 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in codification subtopic asu amends codification subtopic to now require that a reporting entity must disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements and a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  which amends disclosure requirements within subtopic an entity that is an sec filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this change alleviates potential conflicts between subtopic and the sec requirements 
asu is effective upon issuance 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on april   the fasb issued accounting standard codification asc update to asc  income taxes 
on march   the president signed the health care and education reconciliation act of  which is a reconciliation bill that amends the patient protection and affordable care act that was signed by the president on march  collectively the acts 
recently  questions have arisen about the effect  if any  that the different signing dates might have on the accounting for these two acts 
this timing difference  related solely to the signing dates  should not have an impact on a majority of registrants because the acts were both signed within a relatively short time period  which for the vast majority of companies falls into the same reporting period 
after consultation with the fasb staff  the office of the chief accountant would not object to a view that the two acts should be considered together for accounting purposes 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  entities may elect to adopt the amendments in the asu retrospectively for all prior periods 
the company does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements
