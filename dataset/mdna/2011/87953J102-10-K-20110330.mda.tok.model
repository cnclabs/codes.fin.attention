significant accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates for the year ended december  compared to those discussed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  results of operations our operating results are presented on a consolidated basis for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the fiscal year ended december  for the year ended december  and  a tabular summary of results of operations is as follows item comparisons of revenue of revenue revenue equipment and services costs gross profit sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses depreciation and amortization interest expenses other income  net net income before income tax income tax net income we derive our revenues primarily from capital expenditures made by the prc s telecommunications carriers 
our operating revenues are composed of sales of wireless equipment and service sales that include system integration  engineering services  technical support  wireless network optimization and network maintenance 
our consolidated net income increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the prior fiscal year of the net profit margin was for the year ended december   as compared to in the increase in net profit margin was mainly due to the increase in gross profit ratio from in to in as for the increase of the gross profit ratio  it was mainly due to the increase of the gross profit ratio from equipment sales  especially the sales of wfds products

growth of revenue of revenue china mobile china unicom china telecom others overseas total revenues from the wireless telecom carriers were the company s major source of revenue during the year ended december   and the majority of such revenues were generated from china mobile and china unicom 
for the year ended december   our revenues generated from china mobile accounted for of our total revenue in  representing an increase of compared to that of last year 
the increased revenue from china mobile were mainly attributable to the increased demand from china mobile in bejing  inner mongolia  shandong province and other provinces 
our revenue generated from china unicom accounted for of total revenue in  representing an increase of compared to our revenue generated from china telecom accounted for of our total revenue in  representing an increase of compared to the increased revenues from china telecom were mainly attributable to china telecom s increasing investment in g technology

equipment and service costs 
equipment and service costs were approximately  or of revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  or of revenue for for the year ended december   our equipment and services costs increased by  compared to gross profit ratio 
our gross profit ratio was in  as compared to in our gross profit ratio increased as compared with the prior year of because of the increase in gross profit ratio of equipment sales from in to in the increase in gross profit ratio of equipment sales was due to the increase in sales of higher margin products  wfds  and the increase in sales to higher margin areas such as inner mongolia 
operating expenses growth of revenue of revenue sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses depreciation and amortization total compared with  there was an increase in operating expenses of in the percentage of operating expenses to revenues in was  which is similar to sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were approximately  or of our revenue for the year ended december  and were  or of our revenue for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was in line with sales  but to a lesser extent because certain expenses are relatively fixed in nature and we have already built up relationships with our customers in previous years so certain expenses did not increase to the same extent as sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  or of our revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  or of revenue for the increase was mainly due to the stock based compensation expense of  and an additional provision for bad debts of  recognized in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  or of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to  or of revenues in interest expense growth of revenue of revenue interest expense the increase of the interest expense in was due to more interest having been paid on short term loans 
the company s short term loans were  as compared to  for  an increase of liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations from cash flow generated internally and short term bank loans 
as of december   we had current assets of  our current assets were comprised of inventories of  accounts receivable of  prepayments of  other current assets of  receivables due from related parties of  and cash and cash equivalents of  current liabilities were comprised of accounts payable of  tax payables of  short term loans of  customer deposits for sales of equipment of  amounts due to related parties of  and other payables and accruals of  our net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  at december   cash and cash equivalents were  current assets were  and current liabilities were  reflecting a current ratio current assets current liabilities of our trading terms with our customers are mainly on credit 
the accounts receivable turnover period for the year ended december  was days  compared to days for the year ended december  inventory turnover period for the year ended december  was days  compared to days in we experience a longer accounts receivable turnover period than some of our competitors 
this is due to traditionally long payment periods from china s state controlled telecom carriers 
as our major customers  china mobile  china unicom  and china telecom  are state owned and we have not experienced any significant bad debt expense from them in the past  telestone continues to believe that all of our outstanding accounts receivables from them will be paid 
our inventory turnover period decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to internal improvements in our inventory control measures 
as of december   our cash and bank balances are mainly denominated in rmb and us dollars  while our bank borrowings are mainly denominated in rmb 
our revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in rmb and us dollars 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our long credit period arises because our major customers are the three major players in the china telecom market china mobile  china unicom and china telecom 
due to their virtual monopoly in china s telecom market  we are at a disadvantage in negotiations regarding payments and credit periods 
however the big telecom carriers are state owned and recognized as blue chip customers 
the big china telecom carriers are our major customers  and of the revenues of came from them  thus our accounts receivable are a function of our business model 
once a contract is signed  we receive of the contract value within months  another in months  and the remainder in months 
as of december   our accounts receivables were  whereas as of december   our accounts receivables were we have made attempts to adequately address accounts receivable turnover problems and have made efforts to shorten the collection period 
our wfds projects generally have about dsos  since they follow a different business model and serve a different customer base 
as wfds increases as a percentage of total revenues  we expect our dsos to fall even further 
major milestones in and telestone wfds technology was approved by the china state council in january as an innovative local access network solution provider  we are uniquely positioned to benefit from various chinese government sponsored initiatives 
in addition  we maintain good relations with the ministry of science and technology  the ministry of industry and information technology  the beijing municipal government and the administrative committee of z park 
these relationships provide us with timely information regarding opportunities to receive financing support  research and development reimbursements  and tax incentives  thereby enabling us to plan our activities in a timely manner 
we intend to leverage our existing government support to build our technology leadership position and to continue to pioneer industry firsts 
wfds technology enters the us market in august  we signed our first wfds agreement in the us market to install a wfds solution at the memorial hermann hospital headquarters in houston  texas  which subsequently was successfully completed 
this successful deployment represents a major milestone for telestone in marketing its technology in international markets 
we believe that the success of the project and high level of customer satisfaction can help us expand in additional north american and south american markets 
it is also significant that this project was deployed for a non carrier customer  which diversifies telestone s customer base from its traditional telecom carrier customers 
wfds wins china mobile wi fi contract in inner mongolia in april  we received a china mobile wi fi contract of million in inner mongolia for our wfds technology 
we began preliminary onsite installations in may to provide high speed wi fi internet access through five sub provinces of inner mongolia by october four new offices opened in april  we announced that we opened four new branch offices in zhejiang  ningxia  qinghai and anhui provinces as a result of rapid growth of sales in these high growth provinces 
rmb  credit line from bank of beijing in october  telestone received a line of credit for rmb  us  from bank of beijing 
completion of million share offering in november  telestone completed a follow on share offering  offering million shares for proceeds of million 
the majority of the offering million is earmarked for a new manufacturing  r d  and training facility in hebei province 
record revenues and earnings in october  telestone generated record revenue of million  which grew versus the prior year 
net income was also a record million  a increase over off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contingent liabilities we recognize our revenue upon the completion of contracts and have made full tax provision in accordance with relevant national and local laws and regulations of the prc 
a contract is considered completed upon completion of all essential contract work and when installation has been accepted by the customer 
it is the common practice in the prc that invoices are not issued to customers until payments are received 
we follow the practice of reporting our revenue for prc tax purposes when invoices are issued 
all unbilled revenue will become taxable when invoices are issued 
despite the fact that we have made full tax provision in our financial statements  we may be subject to surcharge and penalty for the deferred reporting of tax obligations 
the board of directors considers it is unlikely that the tax surcharge and penalty will be imposed 
remuneration policies we offer competitive remuneration schemes to our employees based on industry practices as well as the employees and the company s performance
