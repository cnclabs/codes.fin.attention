on september   we completed the acquisition of a brazilian prepaid distribution company now known as epay brazil 
this strategic acquisition provides us opportunities to distribute our epay segment s portfolio of global prepaid products in brazil and south america 
with a population of million and over million prepaid subscribers  it provides a large and stable platform for expansion throughout south america 
epay brazil has relationships with all mobile phone operators in brazil  who are aggressively pushing the rollout of electronic top up networks into new regions 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these developments 
business segment overview for a discussion of operating results by segment  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements 
eft processing segment overview our eft processing segment provides outsourcing and network services to financial institutions  primarily in the developing markets of central  eastern and southern europe hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  romania  slovakia  serbia  greece  bulgaria and ukraine  the middle east and asia pacific india and china  as well as in certain developed countries of western europe 
we provide these services either through our euronet owned atms or through contracts under which we operate atms on behalf of financial institutions 
although all of these markets present opportunities for expanding the sales of our services  we believe opportunities for growth in the atm services business are greater in our developing markets 
the major source of revenue generated by our atm network is recurring monthly management fees and transaction based fees 
we receive fixed monthly fees under many of our outsourced management contracts 
the eft processing segment also has revenues from pos operations and merchant management  card network management for credit  debit  prepaid and loyalty cards  prepaid mobile airtime recharge on atms and atm advertising 
the number of atms we operate increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase was largely due to growth in atms driven under new contracts  expansion of atms under existing contracts and the deployment of atms in markets where we operate euronet branded atms 
consistent with our expansion strategy  we saw the most significant growth in the asia pacific region in 
table of contents we monitor the number of transactions made by cardholders on our atm network 
these include cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  deposits  prepaid mobile airtime recharge purchases and certain denied unauthorized transactions 
we do not bill certain transactions on our network to financial institutions  and we have excluded these transactions for reporting purposes 
the number of transactions processed over our entire atm network has increased over the last five years at a compound annual growth rate cagr of approximately as indicated in the following table in millions eft processing transactions per year our processing centers for the eft processing segment are located in budapest  hungary  athens  greece  mumbai  india  belgrade  serbia  beijing  china  and karachi  pakistan 
they are staffed hours a day  seven days a week and consist of production ibm iseries computers  which run the euronet integrated transaction management itm software package 
eft processing products and services outsourced management solutions euronet offers outsourced management services to financial institutions  retailers  mobile phone operators and other organizations using our processing centers electronic financial transaction processing software 
our outsourced management services include management of existing atm networks  development of new atm networks  management of pos networks  management of automated deposit terminals  management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services 
these services include hour monitoring of each atm s status and cash condition  coordinating the cash delivery and management of cash levels in each atm and providing automatic dispatches for necessary service calls 
we also provide real time transaction authorization  advanced monitoring  network gateway access  network switching  hour customer service  maintenance  cash settlement and reconciliation  forecasting and reporting 
since our infrastructure can support a significant increase in transactions  any new outsourced management services agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost 
our outsourced management services agreements generally provide for fixed monthly management fees and  in most cases  fees payable for each transaction 
the transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than those under card acceptance agreements 
euronet branded atm transaction processing our euronet branded atm networks are primarily managed by a processing center that uses our internally developed itm core software solution 
the atms in our network are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of financial institutions and international card organizations such as american express  visa  mastercard  diners club international  discover and china union pay as well as international atm networks such as pulse 
this ability is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these institutions  international credit and debit card issuers and international card associations 
when a bank cardholder conducts a transaction on a euronet owned atm  we receive a fee from the cardholder s bank for that transaction 
the bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network 
when paid indirectly  this fee is referred to as the interchange fee 
all of the banks in a shared atm and pos switching system establish the amount of the interchange fee by agreement 
we receive transaction processing fees for successful transactions and  in certain circumstances  for transactions that are not completed because they fail to receive authorization 
the fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the atm transactions 
we generally receive fees from our customers for four types of atm transactions cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization  and prepaid telecommunication recharges 
card acceptance or sponsorship agreements our agreements with financial institutions and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the customer financial institution or organization may be used at all atms that we operate in a given market 
in most markets  we have agreements with a financial institution under which we are designated as a service provider which we refer to as sponsorship agreements for the acceptance of cards bearing international logos  such as visa and mastercard 
these card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing institution or international card 
table of contents organization 
our agreements generally provide for a term of three to seven years and are automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of non renewal prior to the termination date 
in some cases  the agreements are terminable by either party upon six months notice 
we are generally able to connect a financial institution to our network within to days of signing a card acceptance agreement 
generally  the financial institution provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the atm 
euronet is generally liable for the cash in the atm networks 
under our card acceptance agreements  the atm transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer 
our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency 
transaction fees are sometimes denominated in euros or us dollars or are adjusted for inflation 
transaction fees are billed to financial institutions and card organizations with payment terms typically no longer than one month 
other products and services our network of owned or operated atms allows for the sale of financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost 
we have developed value added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions 
these value added services include prepaid mobile top up  dynamic currency conversion dcc payout  fraud management  bill payment  customer relationship management crm  atm money transfer payout  and atm advertising 
we are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our eft processing customers 
software solutions we also offer a suite of integrated software solutions for electronic payments and transaction delivery systems 
we generate revenue for our software products from licensing  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware  primarily to financial institutions around the world 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we contribute the right to use our itm software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contributions permit us to enter new markets without significant cash outlays 
euronet offers multinational merchants a single european payments area sepa compliant cross border transaction processing solution 
sepa is an area in which all electronic payments can be made and received in the euro  whether between or within national boundaries  under the same basic conditions  rights and obligations  regardless of their location 
this single  centralized acquiring platform enables merchants to benefit from cost savings and faster  more efficient payments transfer 
although many european countries are not members of the eurozone  the platform can serve the merchants in these countries as well  through its multi currency functionality 
additionally  our software products are an integral part of the eft processing segment product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base both internally and externally 
our itm software is used by processing centers in our eft processing segment  resulting in cost savings and added value compared to third party license and maintenance options 
eft processing segment strategy the eft processing segment maintains a strategy to expand the network of atms and pos terminals into developed and developing markets that have the greatest potential for growth 
we believe the greatest opportunities lie in developing markets 
in addition  we follow a supporting strategy to increase the penetration of value added or complementary services across our existing customer base 
growth opportunities are driven through financial institutions that are receptive to outsourcing the operation of their atm  pos and card networks 
the operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel 
these resources are available to us  and we offer them to financial institutions under outsourcing contracts 
the expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions in new and existing markets will remain an important business opportunity for euronet 
increasing the number of non owned atms that we operate under management services agreements and continued development of our credit and debit card outsourcing business should provide continued growth while minimizing our capital investment 
we continually strive to make our own atm networks more efficient by eliminating underperforming atms and installing atms in more desirable locations 
we will make selective additions to our own atm network if we see market demand and profit opportunities 
in recent years  the need for all in services has increased 
banks  particularly smaller banks  are increasingly looking for integrated atm  pos and card issuing processing and management services 
euronet is well positioned for this opportunity as it can offer a full end to end solution to the potential partners 
the eft processing segment s line of services is strengthened through complementary services offered by our epay segment  where we provide prepaid mobile airtime top up services through pos terminals 
we will continue to expand our technology and business 
table of contents methods into other markets where we operate and further leverage our relationships with mobile phone operators and financial institutions to facilitate that expansion 
seasonality our business is significantly impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels after the holiday season 
we have estimated that  absent significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or unusual circumstances  such as the impact of new acquisitions or unusually high levels of growth due to market factors  the overall revenue realized in the eft processing segment is likely to be approximately to lower during the first quarter of each year than in the fourth quarter of the year 
we have historically experienced minimal differences between the second and third quarters of each year 
significant customers and government contracts no individual customer of the eft processing segment makes up greater than of consolidated total revenues 
in india  we have contracts with certain government owned banks to provide certain atm services  including mobile airtime recharge services 
additionally  certain government owned banks are members of our shared atm network in india 
competition our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by financial institutions and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services to financial institutions and independent atm deployers in a particular country 
additionally  large  well financed companies that operate atms offer atm network and outsourcing services  and those that provide card outsourcing  pos processing and merchant acquiring services also compete with us in various markets 
small local operators have also recently begun offering their services  particularly in the independent atm deployment market 
none of these competitors has a dominant market share in any of our markets 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment include breadth of service offering  network availability and response time  price to both the financial institution and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
epay segment overview we currently offer prepaid mobile airtime top up services and other prepaid and payment products on a network of approximately  pos terminals across approximately  retailer locations in europe  the middle east  asia pacific  north america and south america 
we are the world s leading international network for distribution of prepaid mobile airtime top up 
our processing centers for the epay segment are located in basildon  uk  martinsried  germany  milan  italy  and kansas city  missouri  usa 
since  we have continually expanded our prepaid business in new and existing markets by drawing upon our depth of experience to build and nurture relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
in addition to prepaid mobile airtime  we offer a wide range of products across our retail networks  including prepaid debit cards  gift cards  prepaid vouchers  transport payments  lottery payments  prepaid digital content such as music  games and software  prepaid long distance and bill payment 
sources of revenue the epay segment generates commissions or processing fees received from telecommunications service providers for the sale and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime  which is a significant source of revenue for this segment 
we also generate revenue as commissions earned from the distribution of electronic payment products referenced in the preceding paragraph 
customers using mobile phones generally pay for their usage in two ways through postpaid accounts  where usage is billed at the end of each billing period  and through prepaid accounts  where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage 
although mobile phone operators in the us and certain european countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts  the norm in many other countries in europe and the rest of the world is to offer wireless service on a prepaid basis 
this shift is driven by customers perceptions that prepaid products better meet their needs and enable them to better control their monthly wireless expenditures 
currently  two principal methods are available to credit prepaid accounts referred to as top up of accounts 
the first is through the purchase of scratch cards bearing a pin personal identification number that  when entered into a customer s mobile phone account  credits the account by the value of airtime purchased 
scratch cards are sold predominantly through retail outlets 

table of contents the second method used to credit prepaid accounts is through various electronic means of crediting the account using pos terminals 
electronic top up e top up methods have several advantages over scratch cards  primarily because electronic methods do not require the cost of creation  distribution and management of a physical inventory of cards or involve the risk of losses stemming from fraud  theft and mismanagement 
to distribute pins  we establish an electronic connection with the pos terminals and maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal 
as sales to customers of prepaid mobile airtime are completed  the customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement to us of the principal amount of the mobile airtime sold 
we maintain systems that enable us to monitor the payment practices of each retailer 
prior to  scratch cards were the predominant method of crediting mobile phone accounts in most developed markets 
however  since  a shift has occurred in these markets away from usage of scratch cards and e top up is now the predominant method 
we expand our distribution networks through the signing of new contracts with retailers  and in some markets  through the acquisition of existing networks 
we are continuing to focus on our growing network of distributors  generally referred to as independent sales organizations isos  that contract with retailers in their network to distribute prepaid mobile airtime or other content from their pos terminals 
we continue to increase our focus on direct relationships with chains of independent supermarkets  convenience stores  petrol chains  and other larger scale retailers  where we can negotiate agreements with the merchant on a multiyear basis 
epay products and services prepaid mobile airtime transaction processing we process prepaid mobile airtime top up transactions on our pos network across europe  the middle east  asia pacific  north america and south america for two types of clients distributors and retailers 
both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a retail store 
the retailer uses a specially programmed pos terminal in the store or the retailer s electronic cash register ecr system that is connected to our network to buy prepaid mobile airtime 
the customer will select a predefined amount of mobile airtime from the carrier of choice  and the retailer enters the selection into the pos terminal 
the consumer will pay that amount to the retailer in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer 
the pos device then transmits the selected transaction to our processing center 
using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile phone operator or drawing from our inventory of pins  the purchased amount of mobile airtime will be either credited to the consumer s account or delivered via a pin printed by the terminal and given to the consumer 
in the case of pins printed by the terminal  the consumer must then call the mobile phone operator s toll free number to activate the purchased airtime to the consumer s mobile account 
one difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is how we charge for our services 
for distributors and certain very large retailers  we charge a processing fee 
however  the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailer clients 
with these clients  we receive a commission on each transaction that is withheld from the payments made to the mobile phone operator  and we share that commission with the retailers 
retailer and distributor contracts we provide our prepaid services through pos terminals installed in retail outlets or  in the case of major retailers  through direct connections between their electronic cash register ecr systems and our processing centers 
in markets where we operate proprietary technology the uk  australia  poland  ireland  new zealand  spain  greece  india  italy  brazil and the us  we generally own and maintain the pos terminals 
in germany  austria and romania  the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer 
our agreements with major retailers for the pos services typically have one to three year terms 
these agreements include terms regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer s registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of pos terminals  and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed 
generally  our agreements with individual or small retailers have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon three to six months notice 
in germany  distributors are key intermediaries in the sale of e top up 
as a result  our business in germany is substantially concentrated in  and dependent upon  relationships with our major distributors 
the termination of any of our agreements with major distributors could materially and adversely affect our prepaid business in germany 
however  we have been establishing agreements with independent german retailers in order to diversify our exposure to such distributors 

table of contents other products and services our pos network can be used for the distribution of other products and services 
although prepaid mobile airtime is the primary product distributed through our epay segment  additional products include long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans  debit cards  gift cards  prepaid vouchers  transport payments  lottery payments  bill payment and digital content such as music  games and software 
in certain locations  the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise 
for  gross profit from products other than prepaid mobile airtime comprised approximately of the epay segment s gross profit 
we monitor the number of transactions made on our prepaid networks 
the number of transactions processed on our entire pos network has increased over the last five years at a cagr of approximately as indicated in the following table in millions prepaid processing transactions per year epay segment strategy the global strategy for the epay segment is to grow market share by defending mature markets  focusing expansion activity in growth markets and adding positive operating income in all other developing markets 
in addition to maintaining and growing market share in prepaid mobile airtime top up  our growth strategy is achieved through the introduction of new products and content 
new product initiatives focus on products outside of prepaid mobile airtime top up and processing  including gift card malls  prepaid debit cards  transport and digital content  including software and games 
strategic execution behind new products includes the development of relationships with global consumer product brands 
this strategy leverages the global scale of the epay business allowing global brands to be sold in many or all of the countries in which we have a presence 
examples of global brands include apple and microsoft 
financial institutions  telecommunications companies and retail companies have a substantial opportunity to increase revenue by diversifying the products and services currently offered to their merchant base 
epay is deploying additional content through its pos network to retailers  distributors and financial institutions all over the world 
the reach  capabilities and quality of the epay network are appealing as a global distribution channel 
we are one of the largest worldwide multi country operators  and have a distinct competitive advantage from the existing relationships that we maintain with mobile phone operators and retailers 
seasonality the epay business is significantly impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to the higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels following the holiday season 
we expect that  absent significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or unusual circumstances  such as the impact of new acquisitions or unusually high levels of growth due to market factors  the overall revenue realized is likely to be approximately lower during the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of the year 
we have historically experienced minimal differences between the second and third quarters of each year 
significant customers and government contracts no individual customer of our epay segment makes up greater than of consolidated total revenues 
in  epay implemented a contract for the technology and distribution infrastructure for two state owned lotteries in germany 
in addition  epay implemented a contract with the state of florida s usa turnpike partners to add more than  new sunpass cash reloading locations 
this contract complements our existing contracts with the transport for london in the uk and queensland motorways in australia 
there are no other government contracts in the epay segment 
competition we face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets 
we compete with a few multinational companies that operate in several of our markets 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
the mobile phone operators in all of our markets have retail distribution networks of their own through which they offer top up services for their own products 
none of these companies is dominant in any of the markets where we do business 
we believe  however  that we currently have a competitive advantage due to various factors 
first  in germany and australia  our acquired subsidiaries have been concentrating on the sale of electronic prepaid mobile airtime for a longer period than most of our competitors and have significant market presence in those markets 
in addition  we offer complementary atm and prepaid mobile airtime recharge solutions through our eft processing centers 
we believe this improves our ability to solicit the use of networks of devices owned by third parties for example  banks and switching networks to deliver recharge services 
in selected developing markets  we expect to establish a first to market advantage by rolling out terminals rapidly before competition is established 
we also have an extremely flexible technical platform that enables us to tailor pos solutions to individual merchant and mobile phone operator requirements where appropriate 
the gprs wireless technology  designed by our epay germany subsidiary  will also give us an advantage in remote areas where landline phone lines are of lesser quality or are nonexistent 

table of contents the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission paid to retailers for each recharge transaction  breadth of mobile phone operator product and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
we are seeing signs that some mobile phone operators may wish to take over and expand their own distribution networks of prepaid time  and in doing so  they may become our competitors 
additionally  prepaid mobile airtime top up is now being performed online or via mobile devices which provides other alternatives for consumers to use 
money transfer segment overview we provide consumer to consumer money transfer services through a global network of more than  locations 
transfers are originated through sending agents in approximately countries  with money transfer delivery completed in countries 
the initiation of money transfers occur through retail agents or company owned stores  while the delivery of money transfers can occur with bank correspondents  retailer agents or from certain atms 
transferred funds are delivered in local foreign exchange currency 
our sending agent network includes a variety of agents  including large medium size regional retailers  convenience stores  bodegas  multi service shops and phone centers  which are predominantly found in areas with a large immigrant population 
each money transfer transaction is processed using the company s proprietary software system and checked for security  completeness and compliance with federal regulations at every step of the process 
senders can track the progress of their transfers through ria s customer service representatives  and funds are delivered quickly to their beneficiaries via our extensive payout network  which includes large banks and non bank financial institutions  post offices and large retailers 
our processing center for the money transfer segment is located in buena park  california  usa  and we operate call centers in buena park  california  el salvador and spain and provide multi lingual customer service for both our agents and consumers 
money transfer products and services in addition to money transfers  we also offer customers bill payment services  payment alternatives such as money orders and prepaid debit cards  comprehensive check cashing services for a wide variety of issued checks  along with competitive foreign currency exchange services 
these services are all offered through our company owned stores while select services are offered through our agents in certain markets 
ria money orders are widely recognized and exchanged throughout the united states  south america  and around the world 
our check cashing services cover payroll and personal checks  cashier checks  tax refund checks  government checks  insurance drafts and money orders 
our bill payment services offer timely posting of customer bills for over companies  including electric and gas utilities and telephone wireless companies 
bill payment services are offered primarily in the us money transfer products and services are sold primarily through three channels at agent locations and company owned stores by phone teleria  via computer ria online and card based over a pos terminal rialink 
through our teleria service  customers connect to our call center from a telephone available at an agent location or ria store and a representative collects the information over the telephone and enters it directly into our secure proprietary system 
as soon as the data capture is complete  our central system automatically faxes a confirmation receipt to the agent location for the customer to review and sign and the customer pays the agent the money to be transferred  together with a fee 
the agent then faxes the signed receipt back to ria to complete the transaction 
in an online transaction  customers provide the required information to the agent who enters the data into our online platform via a computer using a unique username and password 
the real time online connection we maintain with the agent enables the agent to generate a receipt and complete the transaction 
transactions through rialink are similar to online transactions  but are initiated over a pos terminal once the customer has completed a one time enrollment over the phone with our customer service representative 
rialink has shown good results in high volume stores and agent locations due to the speed  efficiency and ease of use of the pos transfer method 
sources of revenue revenue in the money transfer segment is primarily derived through the charging of a transaction fee  as well as a margin earned from purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
sending agents and receiving agents bank correspondents or retailers each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services 
euronet recognizes these fees as direct operating costs at the time of sale 

table of contents we are one of the largest global money transfer companies in terms of revenues and volumes 
our money transfer segment processed approximately billion in money transfers in money transfer segment strategy the money transfer segment s strategy is to increase the volume of money transfers processed by leveraging our existing banking and merchant retailer relationships to expand our agent and payer networks in existing corridors 
in addition  we pursue expansion into high potential money transfer corridors from the us and internationally beyond the traditional us to mexico corridor 
further  we expect to continue to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our epay and eft processing segments by providing prepaid services through ria s stores and agents and offering our money transfer services at select prepaid retail locations in key markets 
we will continue to make investments in our systems to support this growth 
seasonality our money transfer business is significantly impacted by seasonality that varies by region 
in most of our markets we experience increased money transfer transaction levels during the month of may and in the fourth quarter of each year  coinciding with various holidays 
additionally  in the us to mexico corridor  we usually experience our heaviest volume during the may through october timeframe  coinciding with the increase in worker migration patterns  and our lowest volumes during the first quarter 
during the first quarter of each year we have historically experienced a to decrease in overall transactions when compared to the fourth quarter 
significant customers and government contracts no individual customer of our money transfer segment makes up greater than of consolidated total revenues 
the money transfer segment maintains correspondent relationships with a number of financial institutions whose ownership includes governments of the correspondents countries of origin 
those countries include brazil  costa rica  ecuador  egypt  eritrea  guatemala  indonesia  mexico  romania  uganda and ukraine 
competition our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
our competitors include the western union company  moneygram international inc and others  some of which are larger than we are and have greater resources and access to capital for expansion than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  agents or correspondents  which may result in a loss of our current or potential customers or could force us to lower our prices 
in addition to traditional money payment services  new technologies are emerging that may effectively compete with traditional money payment services  such as stored value cards  debit networks and web based services 
our continued growth also depends upon our ability to compete effectively with these alternative technologies 
product research  development and enhancement in the eft processing segment  development has historically focused on expanding the range of services offered to our bank customers from atm and pos outsourcing to card processing and software services 
in our epay segment  development has focused on expanding the types of electronic payment products and services available to consumers over our network to include  for example  prepaid vouchers  transport payments  lottery payments  gift and debit cards  and bill payment capabilities 
this is intended to make our offerings more attractive to retailers 
we are committed to the maintenance and improvement of our software products

financial information by geographic area for information on results from operations  property and equipment  and total assets by geographic location  please see note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  see item a risk factors  for risk factors related to foreign operations 

table of contents employees we had approximately   and  employees as of december    and  respectively 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit  retain and motivate qualified management  technical and administrative employees 
currently  no union represents any of our employees  except in our spanish subsidiary 
we experienced no work stoppages or strikes by our workforce in and we consider relations with our employees to be good 
government regulation as discussed below  certain of our business activities are subject to regulation in some of our current markets 
in the money transfer segment  we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations of the us  individual us states  foreign markets and other governmental jurisdictions where we operate 
these include international  federal and state anti money laundering laws and regulations  money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws  escheat laws  laws covering consumer privacy  data protection and information security and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws 
our operations have also been subject to increasingly strict requirements intended to help prevent and detect a variety of illegal financial activity  including money laundering  terrorist financing  unauthorized access to personal customer data and other illegal activities 
the more significant of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
noncompliance with these laws and requirements could result in the loss or suspension of licenses or registrations required to provide money transfer services by either ria or its agents 
for more discussion  see item a risk factors 
under german law  we currently may not operate our own atm network in germany without a sponsor  which is bankhaus august lenz bal 
in that market  we act only as a subcontractor providing certain atm related services to bal 
as a result  our activities in the german market currently are entirely dependent upon the continuance of our agreement with bal  or the ability to enter into a similar agreement with another institution in the event of the termination of such agreement 
while we believe  based on our experience  that we should be able to find a replacement for bal if the agreement with bal were to be terminated for any reason  the inability to maintain the bal agreement or to enter into a similar agreement with another institution upon a termination of the bal agreement could have a material adverse effect on our operations in germany 
for further information  see item a risk factors 
we have filed an application in germany for a payment services license  which would enable us to operate our atm network independently of a sponsor bank 
any expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as financial activity under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses 
moreover  the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future 
we monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities 
commencing in november  a new regulatory initiative  the payment services directive psd  has been applicable to certain of our businesses  including in particular  our money transfer services  merchant acquiring  certain card services and bill payment 
the psd initiative requires a license to be obtained to perform such services in a european country  following the expiration of a transition period in april  and such license may be extended throughout the eu through passporting 
conditions of obtaining the license include minimum capital requirements  establishment of procedures for safeguarding of funds  and certain governance and reporting requirements 
in addition  certain regulations relating to the conduct of business  in particular  consumer disclosure requirements and certain rules regarding the timing and settlement of payments  must be met 
in november  we obtained authorization as a payment institution in the uk and have begun complying with these requirements 
we have passported our uk authorization to several countries where the psd is applicable 
money transfer and payment instrument licensing licensing requirements in the us are generally driven by the various state banking departments regulating the businesses of money transfers and issuance of payment instruments 
typical requirements include the meeting of minimum net worth requirements  maintaining permissible investments eg  cash  agent receivables  and government backed securities at levels commensurate with outstanding payment obligations and the filing of a security instrument typically in the form of a surety bond to offset the risk of default of trustee obligations by the license holder 
we are required by many regulators to file interim reports of licensed activity  most often on a quarterly basis  that address changes to agent and branch locations  operating and financial performance  permissible investments and outstanding transmission liabilities 
these periodic reports are utilized by the regulator to monitor ongoing compliance with state licensing laws 
a number of major state regulators also conduct periodic examinations of license holders and their authorized delegates  generally with a frequency of every one to two years 
examinations are most often comprehensive in nature  addressing both the safety and soundness and overall compliance by the license holder with regard to state and federal regulations 
such examinations are typically performed on site at the license holder s headquarters or operations center  however  a number of states will choose to perform examinations off site 
money transmitters  issuers of payment instruments and their agents are required to comply with us federal  state and or foreign anti money laundering laws and regulations 
in summary  our money transfer segment  as well as our agent network  is subject to regulations issued by the different state and foreign national regulators who license us  office of foreign assets control ofac  
table of contents the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act bsa  the financial crimes enforcement network fincen  as well as any existing or future regulations that impact any aspect of our money transfer business 
a similar set of regulations applies to our money transfer businesses in most of the foreign countries in which we originate transactions 
these laws and regulations include monetary limits for money transfers into or out of a country  rules regarding the foreign currency exchange rates offered  as well as other limitations or rules for which we must maintain compliance 
regulatory bodies in the us and abroad may impose additional rules on the conduct of our money transfer segment that could have a significant impact on our operations and our agent network 
escheat regulations our money transfer segment is subject to the unclaimed or abandoned property ie escheat regulations of the ie and certain foreign countries in which we operate 
these laws require us to turn over property held by the company on behalf of others remaining unclaimed after specified periods of time ie  dormancy or escheat periods 
such abandoned property is generally attributable to the failure of beneficiary parties to claim money transfers or the failure to negotiate money orders  a form of payment instrument 
we have policies and programs in place to help us monitor the required relevant information relating to each money transfer or payment instrument for possible eventual reporting to the jurisdiction from which the order was originally received 
in the us  reporting of unclaimed property by money service companies is performed annually  generally with a due date of on or before november state banking department regulators will typically include a review of company escheat procedures and related filings as part of their examination protocol 
privacy and information security regulations our money transfer segment operations involve the collection and storage of certain types of personal customer data that are subject to privacy and security laws in the us and abroad 
in the united states  we are subject to the gramm leach bliley act glba  which requires that financial institutions have in place policies regarding the collection  processing  storage and disclosure of information considered nonpublic personal information 
laws in other countries include those adopted by the member states of the european union under directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of october the directive  as well as the laws of other countries 
the directive prohibits the transfer of personal data to non european union member nations that do not provide adequate protection for personal data 
in some cases  the privacy laws of an eu member state may be more restrictive than the directive and may impose additional requirements that we must comply with to operate in the respective country 
generally  these laws restrict the collection  processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal information and require that we safeguard personal customer data to prevent unauthorized access 
we comply with the glba and any state privacy provision by posting a privacy notice on the receipts provided to the consumers upon completion of a transaction 
in addition  we comply with the directive using the safe harbor permitted by the directive by filing with the us department of commerce  publicly declaring our privacy policy for information collected outside of the us  posting our privacy policy on our web site and requiring our agents in the european union to notify customers of the privacy policy 
recently  as identity theft has been on the rise  there has been increased public attention to concerns about information security and consumer privacy  accompanied by laws and regulations addressing the issue 
we believe we are compliant with these laws and regulations  however  this is an area that is rapidly evolving and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the existing and new regulations  which could have a material  adverse impact on our money transfer segment business 
money transfer compliance policies and programs we have developed risk based policies and programs to comply with the existing  new or changed laws  regulations and other requirements outlined above  including having dedicated compliance personnel  training programs  automated monitoring systems and support functions for our offices and agents 
to assist in managing and monitoring our money laundering and terrorist financing risks  we continue to have our compliance program independently examined on an annual basis 
in addition  we continue to enhance our anti money laundering and anti terrorist financing compliance policy  procedures  monitoring systems and staffing levels 
intellectual property each of our three operating segments utilizes intellectual property which is protected in varying degrees by a combination of trademark  patent and copyright laws  as well as trade secret protection  license and confidentiality agreements 
the brand names of ria  ria envia and afex  derivations of those brand names and certain other brand names are material to our money transfer segment and are registered trademarks and or service marks in most of the markets in which our money transfer segment operates 
consumer perception of these brand names is important to the growth prospects of our money transfer 
table of contents business 
we also hold a us patent on a card based money transfer and bill payment system that allows transactions to be initiated primarily through pos terminals and integrated cash register systems 
with respect to our eft processing segment  we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks  including the names euronet and bankomat and or the blue diamond logo  as well as other trade names in most markets in which these trademarks are used 
certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider these trademarks to be generic and  therefore  not protected by trademark laws 
this determination does not affect our ability to use the euronet trademark in those markets  but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with euronet 
we have registered the euronet trademark in the class of atm machines in germany  the uk and certain other western european countries 
we have filed pending patent applications for a number of our new software products and our new processing technology  including our recharge services 
with respect to our epay segment  we rolled out our new branding for epay in as part of this global branding strategy  we filed trademark applications for the new epay brand in the us  us  the european union eu through a community trademark application  brazil  india  australia and new zealand 
the new trademark has issued to registration in the us  us  the us  australia and new zealand 
the trademark applications in the other jurisdictions are still pending 
we also hold trademarks for our prepaid operating subsidiaries in other jurisdictions  including payspot  inc payspot in the us we cannot be certain that we will be entitled to use the epay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark 
in  we filed a series of patent applications for our pos recharge and certain other products in support of epay and payspot technology 
as of the date of this report  most of these patents are still pending 
we also hold a patent license covering certain of payspot s operations in the us technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly  and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for products  processes and services similar to those we provide 
the procedures of the us patent office make it impossible for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services 
moreover  many process patents have been filed in the us over recent years covering processes that are in wide use in the money transfer  eft and prepaid processing industries 
if any of these patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems  we may be required to obtain additional licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained 
this could materially and adversely affect our business

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not necessarily organized in order of priority or probability 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report 
risks related to our business our business may suffer from risks related to acquisitions and potential future acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our recent growth is due to acquisitions  and we continue to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning potential acquisition opportunities  some of which could be material 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate  or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from  our recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions could adversely impact our long term competitiveness and profitability 
the integration of any future acquisitions will involve a number of risks that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
in particular the integration plans for our acquisitions are based on benefits that involve assumptions as to future events  including leveraging our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers  as well as general business and industry conditions  many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
unforeseen factors may offset components of our integration plans in whole or in part 
as a result  our actual results may vary considerably  or be considerably delayed  compared to our estimates  the integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined 
the combination of companies requires  among other things  coordination of administrative and other functions 
in addition  the loss of key employees  customers or vendors of acquired businesses could materially and adversely impact the integration of the acquired business  the execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from other key responsibilities  we may assume unanticipated liabilities and contingencies  or our acquisition targets could fail to perform in accordance with our expectations at the time of purchase 
future acquisitions may be affected through the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  which could substantially dilute the ownership percentage of our current stockholders 
in addition  shares issued in connection with future acquisitions could be publicly tradable  which could result in a material decrease in the market price of our common stock 
a lack of business opportunities or financial or other resources may impede our ability to continue to expand at desired levels  and our failure to expand operations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on four separate areas i our network of owned and operated atms  ii outsourced atm management contracts  iii our prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment services  and iv our money transfer and bill payment services 
the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the demand for our atm services in our current target markets  the ability to locate appropriate atm sites and obtain necessary approvals for the installation of atms  the ability to install atms in an efficient and timely manner  the expansion of our business into new countries as currently planned  entering into additional card acceptance and atm outsourcing agreements with banks  the ability to renew existing agreements with customers  the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of atms on a timely basis  and the availability of financing for the expansion 
we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into or maintain outsourcing contracts with us 
banks are very deliberate in negotiating these agreements  and the process of negotiating and signing outsourcing agreements typically takes several months 
banks evaluate a 
table of contents wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vendor and generally this decision is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals 
the process is also affected by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries  as well as local language complexities 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from entry into or termination of these management contracts 
in this regard  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
increasing consolidation in the banking industry could make this process less predictable 
we currently offer prepaid mobile airtime top up and other electronic payment services in europe  the middle east  asia pacific  north america and south america 
we plan to expand in these and other markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators  banks and retailers and by offering additional electronic payment products 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements  and renew existing agreements  in these markets with mobile phone operators  banks and retailers  the acceptance and popularity of additional electronic payment products such as prepaid gift and debit cards  prepaid vouchers  transport payments  lottery payments and bill payments  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic prepaid mobile airtime among mobile phone users  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment among immigrant workers  the increase in the number of prepaid mobile phone users  and the availability of financing for the expansion 
in addition  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services and could require financing that we may not be able to obtain 
our ability to manage our rapid expansion effectively will require us eventually to expand our operating systems and employee base 
an inability to do this could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to business cycles  seasonality and other outside factors that may negatively affect our business 
the current recessionary economic environment or other outside factors could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers and could reduce the level of transactions  which could  in turn  negatively impact our financial results 
if mobile phone operators and financial institutions experience decreased demand for their products and services  or if the locations where we provide services decrease in number  we will process fewer transactions  resulting in lower revenue 
in addition  the recessionary economic environment could reduce the level of transactions taking place on our networks  which will have a negative impact on our business 
our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is also subject to substantial seasonal variation 
transaction levels have consistently been much higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to increased use of atms  prepaid mobile airtime top ups and money transfer services during the holiday season 
generally  the level of transactions drops in the first quarter  during which transaction levels are generally the lowest we experience during the year  which reduces the level of revenues that we record 
additionally  in the money transfer segment  we experience increased transaction levels during the may through october timeframe coinciding with the increase in worker migration patterns 
as a result of these seasonal variations  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares 
additionally  economic or political instability  civil unrest  terrorism and natural disasters may make money transfers to  from or within a particular country more difficult 
the inability to timely complete money transfers could adversely affect our business 
a prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession in the us or elsewhere could harm our operations 
concerns over the slow economic recovery  level of us national debt and structural deficits  european sovereign debt crisis  the us mortgage market  inflation levels  energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  reduced business and consumer confidence and continued high unemployment  have negatively impacted the world economy 
a prolonged economic downturn or recession could materially impact our results from operations 
a recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators  retailers and our other customers and could reduce the level of transactions processed on our networks  which would  in turn  negatively impact our financial results 
if mobile phone operators and financial institutions experience decreased demand for their products and services  or if the locations where we provide services decrease in number  we will process fewer transactions  resulting in lower revenue 
retaining the founder and key executives of our company  and of companies that we acquire  and finding and retaining qualified personnel is important to our continued success 

table of contents the development and implementation of our strategy has depended in large part on the co founder of our company  michael j 
brown 
the retention of mr 
brown is important to our continued success 
in addition  the success of the expansion of businesses that we acquire may depend in large part upon the retention of the founders of those businesses 
our success also depends in part on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualified management  operating  marketing  financial and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in the markets where we conduct our business is intense and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire or retain the required personnel 
our officers and some of our key personnel have entered into service or employment agreements containing non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants  which grant incentive stock options and or restricted stock with long term vesting requirements 
however  most of these contracts do not guarantee that these individuals will continue their employment with us 
the loss of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of debt and other contractual commitments  and the cost of servicing those obligations could adversely affect our business  and such risk could increase if we incur more debt 
we may be required to prepay our obligations under the secured syndicated credit facility 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   total liabilities were million  of which million represents long term debt obligations  and total assets were  million 
of our total long term debt obligations  million is comprised of contingently convertible debentures that  in certain situations  could be settled in stock 
we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all such obligations as a result of a variety of factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
if the opportunity of a strategic acquisition arises or if we enter into new contracts that require the installation or servicing of infrastructure  such as processing centers  atm machines or pos terminals on a faster pace than anticipated  we may be required to incur additional debt for these purposes and to fund our working capital needs  which we may not be able to obtain 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to investors  including the following our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable  a substantial portion of our cash flows must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business  our level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  our high degree of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and or a downturn in our business  thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  and because a portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate of interest  our actual debt service obligations could increase as a result of adverse changes in interest rates 
if we fail to make required debt payments  or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements  we would be in default under the terms of these agreements 
this default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have 
prepayment in full of the obligations under our credit facility may be required six months prior to any required repurchase date under our million principal amount convertible debentures due  unless we are able to demonstrate that either i we could borrow unsubordinated funded debt equal to the principal amount of the applicable convertible debentures while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility  or ii we will have sufficient liquidity as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on october   and  or upon a change in control of the company 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may adversely affect us 
the credit facility contains four financial covenants that we must meet as defined in the agreement total debt to ebitda ratio  senior secured debt to ebitda ratio  ebitda to fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum consolidated net worth 
to remain in compliance with our debt covenants  we may be required to increase ebitda  repay debt  or both 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets  liquidity or ebitda to meet or avoid these obligations  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our ability to secure additional financing for growth or to refinance any of our existing debt is also dependent upon the availability of credit in the marketplace  which has experienced severe disruptions due to the recent economic crisis 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or such financing is not available at acceptable terms  we may be unable to secure financing for growth or refinance our debt obligations  if necessary 

table of contents in the event that we need debt financing in the future  recent uncertainty in the credit markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms 
in the event we were to require additional debt financing in the future  the ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets  including the european sovereign debt crisis  could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms 
the inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions  refinance existing debt or materially expand our business in the future 
increases in interest rates will adversely impact our results from operations 
for the million outstanding balance of the term loan  as well as borrowings incurred under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate borrowing arrangements  increases in variable interest rates will increase the amount of interest expense that we pay for our borrowings and have a negative impact on our results from operations 
we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges related to long lived assets and goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
our total assets include approximately million  or of total assets  in goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions 
we assess our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the us to determine whether they are impaired 
in  we determined that certain goodwill assets of our epay businesses in the uk  spain and romania were impaired and we recorded million of non cash impairment charges 
in  we determined that certain goodwill and intangible assets of our spanish epay business and our ria money transfer business were impaired and we recorded a total of million of non cash impairment charges  including the adjustment in first quarter when the measurement was completed 
if operating results in any of our key markets  including the us  us  germany  spain or australia  deteriorate or our plans do not progress as expected when we acquired these entities or if capital markets depress our value or that of similar companies  we may be required to record additional impairment write downs of goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets 
this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
like other participants in the money transfer industry  as a result of downturns in certain labor markets  the current recessionary economic environment and immigration developments  our volume of money transfers from the us to mexico have declined as have related revenues 
these issues have also resulted in certain competitors lowering transaction fees and foreign currency exchange spreads in certain markets where we do business in an attempt to limit the impact on money transfer volumes 
for  money transfer transactions to mexico  which represented approximately of total money transfer transactions  decreased by 
if this trend continues or worsens  or we experience similar trends in our international business  we may be required to record additional impairment write downs of our goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets associated with the money transfer segment 
the processes and systems we employ may be subject to patent protection by other parties 
in certain countries  including the us  patent protection legislation permits the protection of processes and systems 
we employ processes and systems in various markets that have been used in the industry by other parties for many years  and which we or other companies that use the same or similar processes and systems consider to be in the public domain 
however  we are aware that certain parties believe they hold patents that cover some of the processes and systems employed in the prepaid processing industry in the us and elsewhere 
we believe the processes and systems we use have been in the public domain prior to the patents we are aware of 
the question of whether a process or system is in the public domain is a legal determination  and if this issue is litigated we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation 
if a person were to assert that it holds a patent covering any of the processes or systems we use  we would be required to defend ourselves against such claim 
if unsuccessful  we may be required to pay damages for past infringement  which could be trebled if the infringement was found to be willful 
we may also be required to seek a license to continue to use the processes or systems 
such a license may require either a single payment or an ongoing license fee 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain a license which is reasonable in fee and scope 
if a patent owner is unwilling to grant such a license  or we decide not to obtain such a license  we may be required to modify our processes and systems to avoid future infringement 
any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our prepaid processing business in any affected markets and could result in our reconsidering the rate of expansion of this business in those markets 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in central and eastern european countries  and we have subsidiaries in the middle east  asia pacific and south america  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the us or western europe 
we have subsidiaries in central and eastern europe  the middle east  asia pacific and south america 
we expect to continue to expand our operations to other countries in these regions 
we sell software in many other markets in the developing world 
some of these countries have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the us or western europe 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the 
table of contents interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  currently there are no limitations on the repatriation of profits from any of the countries in which we have subsidiaries although us tax laws discourage repatriation  but foreign currency exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations may be imposed or increased in the future with regard to repatriation of earnings and investments from these countries 
if exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations are imposed  our ability to receive dividends or other payments from affected subsidiaries could be reduced  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  corporate  contract  property  insolvency  competition  securities and other laws and regulations in central europe have been  and continue to be  substantially revised 
therefore  the interpretation and procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory systems are in the process of being developed and defined  and existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
also  in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided for under these laws and regulations in a reasonably timely manner  if at all 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in most central european countries 
although these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date  changes in these regulations  including taxation or limitations on transfers of data across national borders  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we conduct business in many international markets with complex and evolving tax rules  including value added tax rules  which subjects us to international tax compliance risks 
while we obtain advice from legal and tax advisors as necessary to help assure compliance with tax and regulatory matters  most tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services  cross border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax  value added tax vat  transfer tax and share registration tax 
our foreign subsidiaries frequently undergo vat reviews  and from time to time undergo comprehensive tax reviews and may be required to make additional tax payments should the review result in different interpretations  allocations or valuations of our services 
as allowable under the internal revenue code the code  the interest deduction from our convertible debentures is based on a comparable interest rate for a traditional  nonconvertible  fixed rate debt instrument with similar terms 
this allowable deduction is in excess of the stated interest rate 
this deduction may be deferred  limited or eliminated under certain conditions 
the u 
s treasury regulations contain an anti abuse regulation  set forth in section g  that grants the commissioner of the internal revenue service authority to depart from the regulations if a result is achieved which is unreasonable in light of the original issue discount provisions of the code  including section e 
the anti abuse regulation further provides that the commissioner may  under this authority  treat a contingent payment feature of a debt instrument as if it were a separate position 
if such an analysis were applied to our convertible debentures and ultimately sustained  our deductions attributable to the convertible debentures could be limited to the stated interest thereon 
the scope of application of the anti abuse regulations is unclear 
however  we are of the view that application of the contingent payment debt instrument regulations to our convertible debentures is a reasonable result such that the anti abuse regulation should not apply 
if a contrary position was asserted and ultimately sustained  our tax deductions would be severely diminished with a resulting adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to service the convertible debentures 
under the code  no deduction is allowed for interest expense in excess of million on convertible subordinated indebtedness incurred to acquire stock or assets of another corporation reduced by any interest paid on other obligations which have provided consideration for an acquisition of stock in another corporation 
if a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures  either alone or together with other debt proceeds  was used for a domestic acquisition and the convertible debentures and other debt  if any  were deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as defined in section of the code  interest deductions for tax purposes in excess of million on such debt reduced by any interest paid on other obligations which have provided consideration for an acquisition of stock in another corporation would be disallowed 
this would adversely impact our cash flow and our ability to pay down the convertible debentures 
we previously applied a significant portion of the proceeds from our december issuance of convertible senior debentures due to acquisitions of foreign corporations 
in prior years  the interest expense attributable to these acquisitions exhausted all of the million annual interest expense deduction permitted under the code for certain convertible subordinated debt incurred for corporation acquisitions 
in  the repurchase of the convertible senior debentures due significantly reduced interest expense for federal income tax purposes and  consequently  a larger portion of the annual interest expense subject to limitation was able to be deducted 
although the portion of interest expense able to be deducted increased  significant interest deductions would be disallowed with respect to our october convertible debentures due if section of the code applied 
we do not currently anticipate that this limitation will apply but there can be no assurance of that fact 

table of contents in the past  the us senate has drafted proposed tax relief legislation that contained a provision that would eliminate the comparable interest rate deduction on future issuances of convertible debentures such as ours 
legislation containing this provision has not been passed  however  we cannot predict if there will be future tax legislation proposed and approved that would eliminate the comparable interest rate deduction 
increases in taxes could negatively impact our operating results 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  tax receipts have decreased and or government spending has increased in many of the countries in which we operate 
consequently  governments may increase tax rates or implement new taxes in order to compensate for gaps between tax revenues and expenditures 
additionally  governments may prohibit or restrict the use of certain legal structures designed to minimize taxes 
any such tax increases  whether borne by us or our customers  could negatively impact our operating results or the demand for our products 
because we are a multinational company conducting a complex business in many markets worldwide  we are subject to legal and operational risks related to staffing and management  as well as a broad array of local legal and regulatory requirements 
operating outside of the us creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international operations  as well as complying with local legal and regulatory requirements 
because we operate financial transaction processing networks that offer new products and services to customers  the laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate are subject to rapid change 
although we have local staff in countries in which we deem it appropriate  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with all applicable customs  currency exchange control regulations  data protection  transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject 
we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified in ways that may adversely affect our business 
because we derive our revenues from a multitude of countries with different currencies  our business is affected by local inflation and foreign currency exchange rates and policies 
we attempt to match any assets denominated in a currency with liabilities denominated in the same currency 
however  a significant amount of our cash outflows  including the acquisition of atms  executive salaries  certain long term contracts and a significant portion of our debt obligations  are made in us dollars  while most of our revenues are denominated in other currencies 
as exchange rates among the us dollar  the euro  and other currencies fluctuate  the translation effect of these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as reported in us dollars 
exchange rate policies have not always allowed for the free conversion of currencies at the market rate 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our results 
our money transfer segment is subject to foreign currency exchange risks because our customers deposit funds in one currency at our retail and agent locations worldwide and we typically deliver funds denominated in a different  destination country currency 
although we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of this risk  we cannot eliminate all of the exposure to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the period between collection and disbursement of the money transfers 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares for a premium in a change of control transaction 
various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware corporate law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party to which our management and board of directors opposes 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and board of directors 
these provisions include preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or to discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock  classification of our directors into three classes with respect to the time for which they hold office  supermajority voting requirements to amend the provision in our certificate of incorporation providing for the classification of our directors into three such classes  non cumulative voting for directors  control by our board of directors of the size of our board of directors  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and 
table of contents advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we have also approved a stockholders rights agreement the rights agreement between euronet and equiserve trust company  na  subsequently renamed computershare limited as rights agent 
pursuant to the rights agreement  holders of our common stock are entitled to purchase one one thousandth  of a share a unit of junior preferred stock at a price of per unit upon certain events 
the purchase price is subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits and other similar events 
generally  in the event a person or entity acquires  or initiates a tender offer to acquire  at least of euronet s then outstanding common stock  the rights will become exercisable for common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right  or effectively at one half of euronet s then current stock price 
the existence of the rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party that is opposed to by our management and board of directors 
our directors and officers  together with the entities with which they are associated  owned approximately of our common stock as of december   giving them significant control over decisions related to our company 
this control includes the ability to influence the election of other directors of our company and to cast a large block of votes with respect to virtually all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
this concentration of control may have the effect of delaying or preventing transactions or a potential change of control of our company 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of million shares of common stock  potentially diluting equity ownership of current holders and the share price of our common stock 
we believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue common stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our board 
these purposes could include  among other things  i to declare future stock dividends or stock splits  which may increase the liquidity of our shares  ii the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses  which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed  iii for use in additional stock incentive programs and iv for other bona fide purposes 
our board of directors may issue the available authorized shares of common stock without notice to  or further action by  our stockholders  unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the nasdaq global select market 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our common stock 
further  over the course of time  all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded  perhaps in large blocks 
this may result in dilution of the market price of the common stock 
an additional million shares of common stock  representing of the shares outstanding as of december   could be added to our total common stock outstanding through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to existing convertible debt and other agreements 
once issued  these shares of common stock could be traded into the market and result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million options and restricted stock awards outstanding held by our directors  officers and employees  which entitles these holders to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock upon exercise 
of this amount  million options are vested and exercisable as of december  approximately million additional shares of our common stock may be issued in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
upon the occurrence of certain events  another million shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion of the company s convertible debentures issued in october  in certain situations  the number of shares issuable could be higher 
accordingly  based on current trading prices of our common stock  approximately million shares could potentially be added to our total current common stock outstanding through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares  which could adversely impact the trading price for our stock 
of the million total options and restricted stock awards outstanding  an aggregate of million options and restricted shares are held by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates and who would be subject to rule thus  upon exercise of their options or sale of shares for which restrictions have lapsed  these affiliates shares would be subject to the trading restrictions imposed by rule the remainder of the common shares issuable under option and restricted stock arrangements would be freely tradable in the public market 
over the course of time  all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded  perhaps in large blocks 

table of contents our competition in the eft processing segment  epay segment and money transfer segment includes large  well financed companies and financial institutions larger than us with earlier entry into the market 
as a result  we may lack the financial resources and access to capital needed to capture increased market share 
eft processing segment our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services only to banks and independent atm deployers in that country 
large  well financed companies offer atm network and outsourcing services that compete with us in various markets 
in some cases  these companies also sell a broader range of card and processing services than we  and are in some cases  willing to discount atm services to obtain large contracts covering a broad range of services 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment include network availability and response time  breadth of service offering  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
for our itm product line  we are a leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries platform in a largely fragmented market  which is made up of competitors that offer a variety of solutions that compete with our products  ranging from single applications to fully integrated electronic financial processing software 
additionally  for itm  other industry suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms  and accordingly are not considered competitors 
we have specifically targeted customers consisting of financial institutions that operate their back office systems with the ibm iseries 
our software solutions business has multiple types of competitors that compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv mobile banking systems  v mobile operator solutions  vi telephone banking and vii full eft software 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
epay segment we face competition in the epay business in all of our markets 
a few multinational companies operate in several of our markets  and we therefore compete with them in a number of countries 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of commissions or to negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators  which may compress our margins 
additionally  certain of our content providers  including mobile phone operators have shown interest in entering into direct contracts with retailers and or developing processing technology that could diminish or eliminate the need for intermediate processors and distributors 
money transfer segment our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
our competitors include the western union company  moneygram international inc and others  some of which are larger than we are and have greater resources and access to capital for expansion than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which may result in a loss of our current or potential customers or could force us to lower our prices 
either of these actions could have an adverse impact on our revenues 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies that provide improved functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable  resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our services 
in addition to traditional money payment services  new technologies are emerging that may effectively compete with traditional money payment services  such as stored value cards  debit networks and web based services 
our continued growth depends upon our ability to compete effectively with these alternative technologies 
the growth and profitability of our epay business is dependent on certain factors that vary from market to market 
our epay segment derives revenues based on processing fees and commissions from mobile phone operators and other content providers 
growth in our prepaid mobile business in any given market is driven by a number of factors  including the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile phone market which is impacted by competing postpaid services  our market share of the retail distribution capacity  the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in the prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain  and the value provided to the retailers through the types of products offered and the level of integration with their systems 
also  competition among prepaid mobile distributors results in retailer churn and the reduction of commissions paid by prepaid content providers  although a portion of such reductions can be passed along to retailers 
in the last year  processing fees and commissions per transaction have declined in most markets  and we expect that trend to continue 
we have been able to improve our results despite that trend due to substantial growth in the number of transactions  driven by acquisitions and organic growth 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees and commissions continue to decline  the combined impact of these factors could adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents our epay and money transfer businesses may be susceptible to fraud and or credit risks occurring at the retailer and or consumer level 
in our epay segment  we contract with retailers that accept payment on our behalf  which we then transfer to a trust or other operating account for payment to content providers 
in the event a retailer does not transfer to us payments that it receives for prepaid content sales  whether as a result of fraud  insolvency  billing delays or otherwise  we are responsible to the content provider for the cost of the product sold 
we can provide no assurance that retailer fraud or insolvency will not increase in the future or that any proceeds we receive under our credit enhancement insurance policies will be adequate to cover losses resulting from retailer fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
with respect to our money transfer business  our business is primarily conducted through our agent network  which provides money transfer services directly to consumers at retail locations 
our agents collect funds directly from consumers and in turn we collect from the agents the proceeds due to us resulting from the money transfer transactions 
therefore  we have credit exposure to our agents 
additionally  our company owned stores transact a significant amount of business in cash 
although we have safeguards in place  cash transactions have a higher exposure to fraud and theft than other types of transactions 
the failure of agents owing us significant amounts to remit funds to us or to repay such amounts  or the loss of cash in our stores could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we typically enter into short term contracts with content providers and retailers  our epay business is subject to the risk of non renewal of those contracts  or renewal under less favorable terms 
our contracts with content providers to distribute and process content  including prepaid mobile airtime recharge services  typically have terms of less than three years 
many of those contracts may be canceled by either party upon three months notice 
our contracts with content providers are not exclusive  so these providers may enter into contracts with other service providers 
in addition  our service contracts with major retailers typically have terms of one to three years  and our contracts with smaller retailers typically may be canceled by either party upon three to six months notice 
the cancellation or non renewal of one or more of our significant content provider or retail contracts  or of a large enough group of our contracts with smaller retailers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the renewal of contracts under less favorable payment terms  commission terms or other terms could have a material adverse impact on our working capital requirements and or results from operations 
in addition  our contracts generally permit operators to reduce our fees at any time 
commission revenue or fee reductions by any of the content providers could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the growth and profitability of our epay business may be adversely affected by changes in state  federal or foreign laws  rules and regulations 
as we continue to expand our electronic payment product offerings  certain of those products may become regulated by state  federal or foreign laws  rules and regulations 
certain new product offerings may be considered to be money transfer related products which would require licensure for entities distributing or processing such products 
if such products become more highly regulated and ultimately require licensure  our epay business may be adversely affected 
our continued growth in our epay business may be contingent on product differentiation and our ability to offer new electronic payment products 
the prepaid marketplace is currently experiencing high growth in the differentiation of product offerings 
while our epay business is focused on expanding and differentiating its suite of prepaid product offerings on a global basis  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into relationships on favorable terms with additional content providers or renew or expand current relationships and contracts on favorable terms 
inability to continue to grow our suite of electronic payment product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the stability and growth of our eft processing segment depend on maintaining our current card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations  and on securing new arrangements for card acceptance and atm management 
the stability and future growth of our eft processing segment depends in part on our ability to sign card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations 
card acceptance agreements allow our atms to accept credit and debit cards issued by banks and international card organizations 
atm management agreements generate service income from our management of atms for banks 
these agreements are the primary source of our atm business 
these agreements have expiration dates  and banks and international card organizations are generally not obligated to renew them 
in some cases  banks may terminate their contracts prior to the expiration of their terms 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to sign or maintain these agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to us or whether those international card 
table of contents organizations will continue to permit our atms to accept their credit and debit cards 
the inability to continue to sign or maintain these agreements  or to continue to accept the credit and debit cards of local banks and international card organizations at our atms in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results depend in part on the volume of transactions on atms in our network and the fees we can collect from processing these transactions 
we generally have little control over the atm transaction fees established in the markets where we operate  and therefore  cannot control any potential reductions in these fees 
transaction fees from banks and international card organizations for transactions processed on our atms have historically accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
these fees are set by agreement among all banks in a particular market 
the future operating results of our atm business depend on the following factors the increased issuance of credit and debit cards  the increased acceptance of our atm processing and management services in our target markets  the maintenance of the level of transaction fees we receive  the installation of larger numbers of atms  and the continued use of our atms by credit and debit cardholders 
the amount of fees we receive per transaction is set in various ways in the markets in which we do business 
we have card acceptance agreements or atm management agreements with some banks under which fees are set 
however  we derive the bulk of our revenues in most markets from interchange fees that are set by the central atm processing switch 
the banks that participate in these switches set the interchange fee  and we are not in a position in any market to greatly influence these fees  which may increase or decrease over time 
a significant decrease in the interchange fee in any market could adversely affect our results in that market 
although we believe that the volume of transactions in developing countries may increase due to growth in the number of cards being issued by banks in these markets  we anticipate that transaction levels on any given atm in developing markets will not increase significantly 
we can attempt to improve the levels of transactions on our atm network overall by acquiring good sites for our atms  eliminating poor locations  entering new less developed markets and adding new transactions to the sets of transactions that are available on our atms 
however  we may not be successful in materially increasing transaction levels through these measures 
per transaction fees paid by international card organizations have declined in certain markets in recent years and competitive factors have required us to reduce the transaction fees we charge customers 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees generally decline  our results would be adversely affected 
developments in electronic financial transactions could materially reduce our transaction levels and revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the need for atms  prepaid mobile phone pos terminals and money transfer agents 
these developments may reduce the transaction levels that we experience on our networks in the markets where they occur 
financial institutions  retailers and agents could elect to increase fees to their customers for using our services  which may cause a decline in the use of our services and have an adverse effect on our revenues 
if transaction levels over our existing network of atms  pos terminals  agents and other distribution methods do not increase  growth in our revenues will depend primarily on increased capital investment for new sites and developing new markets  which reduces the margin we realize from our revenues 
the mobile phone industry is a rapidly evolving area  in which technological developments  in particular the development of new distribution methods or services  may affect the demand for other services in a dramatic way 
the development of any new technology that reduces the need or demand for prepaid mobile airtime could materially and adversely affect our business 
in some cases  we are dependent upon international card organizations and national transaction processing switches to provide assistance in obtaining settlement from card issuers of funds relating to transactions on our atms 
our atms dispense cash relating to transactions on credit and debit cards issued by banks 
we have in place arrangements for the settlement to us of all of those transactions  but in some cases  we do not have a direct relationship with the card issuing bank and rely for settlement on the application of rules that are administered by international card associations such as visa or mastercard or national transaction processing switching networks 
if a bankcard association fails to settle transactions in accordance with those rules  we are dependent upon cooperation from such organizations or switching networks to enforce our right of settlement against such banks or card associations 
failure by such organizations or switches to provide the required cooperation could result in our inability to obtain settlement of funds relating to transactions and adversely affect our business 

table of contents because our business is highly dependent on the proper operation of our computer network and telecommunications connections  significant technical disruptions to these systems would adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with financial institutions  mobile phone operators  retailers and agents 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
our atm segment also uses a satellite based system that is susceptible to the risk of satellite failure 
there are operational risks inherent in this type of business that can result in the temporary shutdown of part or all of our processing systems  such as failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
excluding germany  transactions in the eft processing segment are processed through our athens  budapest  belgrade  beijing  mumbai and karachi processing centers 
transactions in the epay segment are processed through our basildon  martinsried  milan and kansas city  missouri processing centers 
transactions in our money transfer segment are processed through our buena park  california processing center 
any operational problem in these centers may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our networks 
even with disaster recovery procedures in place  these risks cannot be eliminated entirely  and any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
we are subject to the risks of liability for fraudulent bankcard and other card transactions involving a breach in our security systems  breaches of our information security policies or safeguards  as well as for atm theft and vandalism 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive information in conducting and managing electronic  financial and mobile transactions  such as card information and pin numbers 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks  in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent or other card transactions by persons outside the company or by our own employees  and the use of fraudulent cards on our network of owned or outsourced atms and pos devices 
we incorporate industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software  and maintain controls and procedures regarding access to our computer systems by employees and others  to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology decrease security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
in addition  the cost and timeframes required for implementation of new technology may result in a time lag between availability of such technology and our adoption of it 
further  our controls  procedures and technology may not be able to detect when there is a breach  causing a delay in our ability to mitigate it 
the recent economic crisis increases the risk that criminals will attempt such data theft 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may bear the liability 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
we also collect  transfer and retain consumer data as part of our money transfer business 
these activities are subject to certain consumer privacy laws and regulations in the us and in other jurisdictions where our money transfer services are offered 
we maintain technical and operational safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements 
despite these safeguards  there remains a risk that these safeguards could be breached resulting in improper access to  and disclosure of  sensitive consumer information 
breaches of our security policies or applicable legal requirements resulting in a compromise of consumer data could expose us to regulatory enforcement action  subject us to litigation  limit our ability to provide money transfer services and or cause harm to our reputation 
in addition to electronic fraud issues and breaches of our information security policies and safeguards  the possible theft and vandalism of atms present risks for our atm business 
we install atms at high traffic sites and consequently our atms are exposed to theft and vandalism 
although we are insured against such risks  deductibles  exclusions or limitations in such insurance may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
in addition  we have experienced increases in claims under our insurance  which has increased our insurance premiums 
we could incur substantial losses if one of the third party depository institutions we use in our operations were to fail 
as part of our business operations we maintain cash balances at third party depository institutions 
we could incur substantial losses if a financial institution in which we have significant deposits fails 

table of contents we are required under german law and the rules of financial transaction switching networks in all of our markets to have sponsors to operate atms and switch atm transactions 
our failure to secure sponsor arrangements in germany or any other market could prevent us from doing business in that market 
under german law  only a licensed financial institution may operate atms 
because we are not a licensed financial institution we are required to have a sponsor bank to conduct our german atm operations 
in addition  in all of our markets  our atms are connected to national financial transaction switching networks owned or operated by banks  and to other international financial transaction switching networks operated by organizations such as citibank  visa and mastercard 
the rules governing these switching networks require any company sending transactions through these switches to be a bank or a technical service processor that is approved and monitored by a bank 
as a result  the operation of our atm network in all of our markets depends on our ability to secure these sponsor arrangements with financial institutions 
to date  we have been successful in reaching contractual arrangements that have permitted us to operate in all of our target markets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in reaching these arrangements  and it is possible that our current arrangements will not continue to be renewed 
if we are unable to secure sponsor arrangements in germany or any other market  we could be prevented from doing business in the applicable market 
competition in our eft processing segment has increased over the last several years  increasing the risk that certain of our long term bank outsourcing contracts may be terminated or not renewed upon expiration 
the developing markets in which we have done business have matured over the years  resulting in increasing competition 
in addition  as consolidation of financial institutions in central and eastern europe continues  certain of our customers have established or are establishing internal atm management and processing capabilities 
as a result of these developments  negotiations regarding renewal of contracts have become increasingly challenging and in certain cases we have reduced fees to extend contracts beyond their original terms 
in certain other cases  contracts have been  and in the future may be  terminated by financial institutions resulting in a substantial reduction in revenue 
contract termination payments  if any  may be inadequate to replace revenues and operating income associated with these contracts 
although we have historically considered the risk of non renewal of major contracts to be relatively low because of complex interfaces and operational procedures established for those contracts  the risk of non renewal or early termination is increasing 
our operating results in the money transfer business depend in part on continued worker immigration patterns  our ability to expand our share of the existing electronic market and to expand into new markets and our ability to continue complying with regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control ofac  bank secrecy act bsa  financial crimes enforcement network fincen  patriot act regulations or any other existing or future regulations that impact any aspect of our money transfer business 
our money transfer business primarily focuses on workers who migrate to foreign countries in search of employment and then send a portion of their earnings to family members in their home countries 
changes in us and foreign government policies or enforcement toward immigration may have a negative effect on immigration in the us and other countries  which could also have an adverse impact on our money transfer revenues 
both us and foreign regulators have become increasingly aggressive in the enforcement of the various regulatory regimes applicable to our businesses and the imposition of fines and penalties in the event of violations 
our ability to continue complying with the requirements of ofac  bsa  fincen  the patriot act and other regulations both us and foreign is important to our success in achieving growth and an inability to do this could have an adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
anti money laundering regulations require us to be responsible for the compliance by agents with such regulations 
although we have training and compliance programs in place  we cannot be certain our agents will comply with such regulations and we may be held responsible for their failure to comply  resulting in fines and penalties 
future growth and profitability depend upon expansion within the markets in which we currently operate and the development of new markets for our money transfer services 
our expansion into new markets is dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate ria into our existing operations  to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to satisfy market demand 
we may not have adequate financial and technological resources to expand our distribution channels and product applications to satisfy these demands  which may have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve expected growth in revenues and earnings 
changes in state  federal or foreign laws  rules and regulations could impact the money transfer industry  making it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers 
we are subject to regulation by the us states in which we operate  by the us federal government and by the governments of the other countries in which we operate 
changes in the laws  rules and regulations of these governmental entities  and our ability to obtain or retain required licensure  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 

table of contents changes in banking industry regulation and practice could make it more difficult for us and our agents to maintain depository accounts with banks 
the banking industry  in light of increased regulatory oversight  is continually examining its business relationships with companies who offer money transfer services and with retail agents who collect and remit cash collected from end consumers 
should banks decide to not offer depository services to companies engaged in processing money transfer transactions  or to retail agents who collect and remit cash from end customers  our ability to administer and collect fees from money transfer transactions could be adversely impacted 
if we are unable to maintain our money transfer agent and correspondent networks  our business may be adversely affected 
our money transfer based revenues are primarily generated through the use of our agent and correspondent networks 
transaction volumes at existing locations may increase over time and new agents provide us with additional revenues 
if agents or correspondents decide to leave our network or if we are unable to sign new agents or correspondents  our revenue and profit growth rates may be adversely affected 
our agents and correspondents are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that vary significantly  depending on the legal jurisdiction 
changes in these laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to maintain the networks or the cost of providing money transfer services 
in addition  agents may generate fewer transactions or less revenue due to various factors  including increased competition 
because our agents and correspondents are third parties that may sell products and provide services in addition to our money transfer services  they may encounter business difficulties unrelated to the provision of our services  which may cause the agents or correspondents to reduce their number of locations or hours of operation  or cease doing business altogether 
if consumer confidence in our money transfer business or brands declines  our business may be adversely affected 
our money transfer business relies on consumer confidence in our brands and our ability to provide efficient and reliable money transfer services 
a decline in consumer confidence in our business or brands  or in traditional money transfer providers as a means to transfer money  may adversely impact transaction volumes which would in turn be expected to adversely impact our business 
our money transfer service offerings are dependent on financial institutions to provide such offerings 
our money transfer business involves transferring funds internationally and is dependent upon foreign and domestic financial institutions  including our competitors  to execute funds transfers and foreign currency transactions 
changes to existing regulations of financial institution operations  such as those designed to combat terrorism or money laundering  could require us to alter our operating procedures in a manner that increases our cost of doing business or to terminate certain product offerings 
in addition  as a result of existing regulations and or changes to those regulations  financial institutions could decide to cease providing the services on which we depend  requiring us to terminate certain product offerings 
the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the us congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation  known as the dodd frank act  that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the dodd frank act was signed into law by the president on july   and requires the commodities futures trading commission  or cftc  and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
the act also requires the cftc to institute broad new position limits for futures and options traded on regulated exchanges 
as the law favors exchange trading and clearing  the dodd frank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded  although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the dodd frank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty  or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements  which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us 
the dodd frank act and any new regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including requirements to post collateral  which could adversely affect our available liquidity  ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  and iii reduce the liquidity of foreign currency related derivatives 

table of contents if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
