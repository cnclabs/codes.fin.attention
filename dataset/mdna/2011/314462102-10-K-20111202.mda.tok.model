fc is the only currently available product under a woman control and approved by the us food and drug administration fda that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections stis  including hiv aids 
in  the company introduced a second generation female condom  fc  which had been developed to expand access to female initiated prevention by offering a more affordable product increase hiv aids prevention lower health care costs increase gross margins in august  after a stringent technical review  the world health organization who cleared fc for purchase by un agencies 
the first substantial sales of fc occurred in fiscal fc received fda approval as a class iii medical device on march  and became available in the united states in august in addition to fda approval  the fc female condom has been approved by other regulatory agencies  including in the european union  india  and brazil 
in october  the company completed the transition from its first generation product  fc  to its second generation product  fc  and production of fc ceased 
although fc production has ceased  the company retains ownership of certain world wide rights to fc  as well as various patents  regulatory approvals and other intellectual property related to fc from its introduction in march through september   approximately million fc female condoms have been distributed in countries 
since the last shipments of fc were produced and sold in october  all units sold have been fc the fc female condom provides women dual protection against sti s including hiv aids and unintended pregnancy 
because fc s primary usage is that of disease prevention  the public health sector is the company s main market 
within the public health sector  various organizations supply critical products such as fc  at no cost or low cost  to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves 
fc is currently available in countries 
a significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world 
the incidence of hiv aids  other sti s and unwanted pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits come of the world s most underprivileged people 
however  conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development  tender applications and processing orders 
the company has a relatively small customer base  with a limited number of customers who generally purchase in large quantities 
over the past few years  major customers have included large global agencies  such as the united nations population fund unfpa and the united states agency for international development usaid  through its facilitator  john snow  inc other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies  which either purchase directly or via in country distributors  and non governmental organizations 
purchasing patterns vary significantly from one customer to another  and may reflect factors other than simple demand 
for example  some governmental agencies purchase through a formal procurement process in which a tender request for bid is issued for either a specific or a maximum unit quantity 
tenders also define the other elements required for a qualified bid submission such as product specifications  regulatory approvals  clearance by who  unit pricing and delivery timetable 
bidders have a limited period of time in which to submit bids 
bids are subjected to an evaluation process which is intended to conclude with a tender award to the successful bidder 
the entire tender process  from publication to award  may take many months to complete 
administrative issues  politics  bureaucracy  process errors  changes in leadership  funding priorities and or other pressures may delay or derail the process and affect the purchasing patterns of public sector customers 
as a result  the company may experience significant quarter to quarter sales variations due to the timing and shipment of large orders 
in the past couple years  the company s business model  which includes high gross margins  modest capital expenditures and low expense requirements compared to production volumes  has permitted the company to sustain profitable operations without debt and maintain dividend payments during periods of delayed orders 
continuation of these accomplishments in the future periods will be contingent on a number of factors  including the degree and period of sales volatility and on the strength of global demand for the company s product 
during fiscal  the company unit shipments  revenues and net income were adversely affected by bureaucratic delays and other timing issues involving the receipt and shipment of large orders from brazil and the republic of south africa rsa 
in november  the company received an order from the rsa department of health for million units of fc for delivery as soon as possible 
shipments against the order will begin prior to the end of the calendar year 
with respect to the brazil tender for up to million units  the company has been advised by unfpa that an order will be placed through unfpa 
the company anticipates that the rsa order  any additional orders that may be received from rsa and the order expected from unfpa with respect to the brazilian tender will positively impact results for fiscal revenues 
most of the company revenues have been derived from sales of the fc female condoms fc and fc  and are recognized upon shipment of the product to its customers 
since fiscal  revenue is also being derived from licensing its intellectual property to its exclusive distributor in india  hindustan lifecare limited hll 
hll is authorized to manufacture fc at hll facility in kochi  india for sale in india 
hll is the company exclusive distributor in india and the company receives a royalty based on the number of units sold by hll in india 
such revenue appears as royalties on the audited consolidated statements of income for the years ended september   and  and is recognized in the period in which the sale is made by hll 
the company strategy is to further develop a global market and distribution network for its product by maintaining relationships with public health sector groups and completing partnership arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise 
the company s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies or those who facilitate their purchases and or distribution 
the company two largest customers currently are john snow  inc  facilitator of usaid i deliver project  and unfpa 
john snow  inc accounted for of unit sales in fiscal  of unit sales in fiscal and of unit sales in fiscal  and unfpa accounted for of unit sales in fiscal  of unit sales in fiscal and of unit sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of unit sales in fiscal  or because the company manufactures fc in a leased facility located in malaysia  a portion of the company operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies 
while a material portion of the company future sales are likely to be in foreign markets  all sales are denominated in united states dollars 
in july  the company contributed capital to a subsidiary to reduce its exposure to future currency gains or losses between the entities 
effective october   the company s uk and malaysia subsidiaries adopted the us dollar as their functional currency  further reducing the company s foreign currency risk 
while our second generation product  fc  is sold at a lower price per unit than fc was sold  fc is less costly to produce than was fc as a result  sales of fc have a higher gross margin than fc thus  the transition to sales of solely fc impacted both net revenues and gross profit 
expenses 
the company previously manufactured fc at a facility located in the united kingdom and manufactures fc at its facility located in selangor de  malaysia 
the company cost of sales consists primarily of direct material costs  direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs 
direct material costs include raw materials used to make the female condoms  principally polyurethane for fc and a nitrile polymer for fc indirect product costs include logistics  quality control and maintenance expenses  as well as costs for helium  nitrogen  electricity and other utilities 
all of the key components for the manufacture of the fc female condom are essentially available from multiple sources 
on august   the company announced to its uk employees that the company was evaluating the future of its uk facility following the decision of two of its largest customers to switch their purchases from the first generation product  fc  manufactured in the uk facility  to the second generation product  fc  which is manufactured in malaysia 
as is required by british labor law  the company went through an evaluation process  working in tandem with employee representatives  in which various manufacturing alternatives were considered 
as the company was unable to identify a satisfactory alternative  the facility s manufacturing operations ceased in october in fiscal  the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million for restructuring costs  including redundancy payments to terminated employees and associated expenses  related to the cessation of fc manufacturing at its uk facility 
the evaluation process  which began on august   concluded late in november  when employees received their redundancy payments 
the cash portion of the restructuring costs was funded internally 
in fiscal  the company incurred a one time charge of million for restructuring expenses related to exiting the lease of its former uk manufacturing facility

on august   the company entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement the loan agreement with heartland bank the bank to extend the term of the company s revolving line of credit to august  and revise the structure of the revolving line of credit 
the previous structure consisted of a revolving note for up to  with borrowings limited to of eligible accounts receivable and a revolving note for up to  with borrowings limited to the amount of a supporting letter of credit issued by the world bank or another issuer of equivalent credit quality approved by the bank 
the new structure consists of a single revolving note for up to  with the bank  with borrowings limited to a borrowing base determined based on to of eligible accounts receivable plus of eligible inventory

the following table includes information relating to our contractual obligations as of september  in future fiscal years contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures 
critical accounting estimates include the deferred income tax valuation allowance 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company files separate income tax returns for its foreign subsidiaries 
asc topic requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also provided for carryforwards for income tax purposes 
in addition  the amount of any future tax benefits is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized 
the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company completes a detailed analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances on an annual basis or more frequently if information comes to our attention that would indicate that a revision to its estimates is necessary 
in evaluating the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country by country basis  including past operating results and forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions to forecast us federal and state  us and malaysia operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of the future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the company s business 
it should be noted that the company realized significant losses through on a consolidated basis 
since fiscal year  the company has consistently generated taxable income on a consolidated basis  providing a reasonable future period in which the company can reasonably expect to generate taxable income 
in management s analysis to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset to recognize  management projected future taxable income for the subsequent five years for each tax jurisdiction 
although management uses the best information available  it is reasonably possible that the estimates used by the company will be materially different from the actual results 
these differences could have a material effect on the company future results of operations and financial condition 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations  state taxes  certain benefits realized related to equity based awards  and utilization of nol carryforwards 
the effective tax rates  before considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  were   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws  regulations  and accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation  the company has experienced increased costs of product  supplies  salaries and benefits  and increased general and administrative expenses 
the company has  where possible  increased selling prices to offset such increases in costs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuations in raw material commodity prices  particularly the nitrile polymer used to manufacture fc  and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the company foreign operations 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or to hedge risk and holds no derivative financial instruments which would expose it to significant market risk 
effective october   the company uk subsidiary and malaysia subsidiary each adopted the us dollar as its functional currency 
the consistent use of the us dollar as the functional currency across the company reduces its foreign currency risk and stabilizes its operating results 
the company currently has no significant exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has a line of credit with heartland bank  consisting of a revolving note for up to  with borrowings limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
outstanding borrowings under the line of credit will incur interest at a rate equal to a base rate plus 
the company has not had any outstanding borrowings in the last five years 
there is  therefore  currently no significant exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to the extent that the company incurs future borrowings under its lines of credit  it would be subject to interest rate risk related to such borrowings
