item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s operations over the last several years generally reflect three trends or events which the company expects to continue i increased attention to niche insurance products  such as the company s funeral plan policies and traditional whole life products  ii emphasis on cemetery and mortuary business  and iii capitalizing on low interest rates by originating and refinancing mortgage loans 
mortgage operations over of the company s revenues and expenses are through its wholly owned subsidiary  securitynational mortgage 
securitynational mortgage is a mortgage lender incorporated under the laws of the state of utah 
securitynational mortgage is approved and regulated by the federal housing administration fha  a department of the us department of housing and urban development hud  to originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower 
securitynational mortgage obtains loans primarily from its retail offices and independent brokers 
securitynational mortgage funds the loans from internal cash flows  including loan purchase agreements from security national life  and with unaffiliated financial institutions 
securitynational mortgage receives fees from the borrowers and other secondary fees from third party investors that purchase its loans 
securitynational mortgage sells its loans to third party investors and does not retain servicing of these loans 
securitynational mortgage pays the brokers and retail loan officers a commission for loans that are brokered through securitynational mortgage 
for the twelve months ended december    and  securitynational mortgage originated and sold  loans  total volume   loans  total volume  and  loans  total volume  respectively 
the loan volume in was lower than primarily due to reduced refinancing activity in for the first six months of  the loan volume was primarily from home purchases and was lower from the same period in due to the slow down in the economy  the reduced demand in the housing sector  and new regulations affecting mortgage origination and lending activities 
for the third and fourth quarters of  the loan volume increased from the previous two quarters due to an increase in refinancing activity 
securitynational mortgage anticipates the loan volume for to be at the  to  per month range compared to  to  per month range in as a result  securitynational mortgage has taken steps to reduce staff and funding costs to adjust to these reduced levels of production 
the reason for the anticipated reduction in loan volume in is due to the low demand in the housing sector and rising interest rates that adversely impacts the refinancing markets 
securitynational mortgage has entered into a loan purchase agreement to originate and sell mortgage loans to an unaffiliated warehouse bank 
the amount available to originate loans under this agreement at december  was  securitynational mortgage originates the loans and immediately sells them to the warehouse bank 
generally  when mortgage loans are sold to warehouse banks  securitynational mortgage is no longer obligated  except in certain circumstances  to pay the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loans  but is required to pay a fee in the form of interest on a portion of the mortgage loans between the date that the loans are sold to warehouse banks and the date of settlement with third party investors 
the terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year  with interest rates on a portion of the mortgage loans ranging from to over the day libor rate 
securitynational mortgage renewed its loan purchase agreement with wells fargo securities that expired on june  for an additional one year term 
the following table shows the condensed financial results for the year  and see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december in thousands of dollars vs increase decrease vs increase decrease revenues from external customers income from loan originations secondary gains from investors total earnings losses before income taxes overall  this decrease in profitability for the twelve months ended december  is due to the lower loan volume and lower secondary gains from investors 
however  profitability improved in the third and fourth quarters for due to increased loan volume during that period 
mortgage accounting policy mortgage fee income consists of origination fees  processing fees  and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
for mortgage loans sold to third party investors  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles at the time the sales of mortgage loans comply with the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets  which are i the transferred assets have been isolated from the company and its creditors  ii the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage  and iii the company does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage 
the company must determine that all three criteria are met at the time a loan is funded 
all rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors  including investor commitments for the loans  prior to warehouse banks purchasing the loans under the purchase commitments 
as of december   there were  in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending 
the company  through securitynational mortgage  sells all mortgage loans to third party investors without recourse 
however  it may be required to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events  which include the following failure to deliver original documents specified by the investor 
the existence of misrepresentation or fraud in the origination of the loan 
the loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold 
early pay off of a loan  as defined by the agreements 
excessive time to settle a loan 
investor declines purchase 
discontinued product and expired commitment 
loan purchase commitments generally specify a date to days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled 
depending on market conditions  these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the company 
generally  a ten day extension will cost 
basis points of the loan amount 
the company s historical data shows that of all loans originated by securitynational mortgage are generally settled by the investors as agreed within days after delivery 
there are situations  however  when the company determines that it is unable to enforce the settlement of loans rejected by the third party investors and that it is in its best interest to repurchase those loans from the warehouse banks 
it is the company policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third party investors concerning the loans 
the company believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues  to enforce purchase commitments  and to exhaust other alternatives 
remedial methods include the following research reasons for rejection 
provide additional documents 
request investor exceptions 
appeal rejection decision to purchase committee 
commit to secondary investors 
once purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted  which could be earlier than the six month time period  the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or market value and previously recorded sales revenue is reversed 
any loan that later becomes delinquent is evaluated by the company at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly 
determining lower of cost or market cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the company 
market value is often difficult to determine  but is based on the following for loans that have an active market  the company uses the market price on the repurchased date 
for loans where there is no market but there is a similar product  the company uses the market value for the similar product on the repurchased date 
for loans where no active market exists on the repurchased date  the company determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchased date  after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows 
the appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to the company s determination of fair value because  if the loan becomes delinquent  the company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan 
in determining the market value on the date of repurchase  the company considers the total value of all of the loans because any sale of loans would be made as a pool 
for mortgages originated and held for investment  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized when the loan is originated 
mortgage loan repurchases and delinquencies the mortgage industry is still experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
the company funded  of its production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings in august the company believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  the company discontinued offering these loans in september as a result of the volatile secondary market for mortgage loans  the company sold mortgage loans in and to certain third party investors  including lehman brothers aurora loan services and bear stearns emc mortgage corp  that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of such loans was  of which  were loans in which the secondary market no longer existed 
due to these changes in circumstances  the company regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of assets from former transferees in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment purposes  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for chargeoffs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the  and financial statements reflect the transfer of mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
as standard in the industry  the company received payments on the mortgage loans during the time period between the sale date and settlement or repurchase date 
during this period  the company services these loans through securitynational mortgage 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount   of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received or recognized any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company increased its allowance for mortgage losses by  and  respectively  which was charged to loan loss expense and included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the period 
the allowances for mortgage loan losses as of december  and were  and  respectively 
also at december   the company had foreclosed on a total of  in long term mortgage loans  of which  of the loans foreclosed were reclassified as other real estate held for investment or sale during the company carries the foreclosed properties in security national life  memorial estates  and securitynational mortgage  its respective life  cemeteries and mortuaries  and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them 
mortgage loan loss settlements the mortgage industry has seen potential loan losses increase 
future loan losses are extremely difficult to estimate  especially in the current market 
however  management believes that the company s reserve methodology and its current practice of property preservation allow it to estimate its losses on loans sold 
the amounts accrued for loan losses in years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and  as of december  and  the balances were  and  respectively 
aurora loan services on april   securitynational mortgage entered into a loan purchase agreement with lehman brothers bank lehman brothers 
under the terms of the loan purchase agreement  lehman brothers agreed to purchase mortgage loans from time to time from securitynational mortgage 
during  lehman brothers and its wholly owned subsidiary  aurora loan services llc  purchased a total of  mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of  from securitynational mortgage 
on january  aurora loan services announced it was suspending all wholesale and correspondent mortgage originations 
as a result of this policy change  lehman brothers and aurora loan services discontinued purchasing mortgage loans from mortgage brokers and lenders  including securitynational mortgage 
during  aurora loan services maintained that as part of its quality control efforts it reviewed mortgage loans purchased from securitynational mortgage and determined that certain of the loans contained alleged misrepresentations and early payment defaults 
aurora loan services further maintained that these alleged breaches in the purchased mortgage loans provide lehman brothers and aurora loan services with the right to require securitynational mortgage to immediately repurchase the mortgage loans containing the alleged breaches in accordance with the terms of the loan purchase agreement 
in order for lehman brothers and aurora loan services to refrain from demanding immediate repurchase of the mortgage loans by securitynational mortgage  securitynational mortgage was willing to enter into an agreement to indemnify lehman brothers and aurora loan services for any losses incurred in connection with certain mortgage loans with alleged breaches that were purchased from securitynational mortgage 
on december   securitynational mortgage entered into an indemnification agreement with lehman brothers and aurora loan services 
under the terms of the indemnification agreement  securitynational mortgage agrees to indemnify lehman brothers and aurora loan services for of all losses that lehman brothers and aurora loan services may have as a result of any current or future defaults by mortgagors on mortgage loans that were purchased from securitynational mortgage and listed as an attachment to the indemnification agreement 
securitynational mortgage is released from any obligation to pay the remaining of such losses 
the indemnification agreement also requires securitynational mortgage to indemnify lehman brothers and aurora loan services for of any future losses incurred on mortgage loans with alleged breaches that are not listed on the attachment to the agreement 
concurrently with the execution of the indemnification agreement  securitynational mortgage paid  to aurora loan services as a deposit into a reserve account to secure the obligations of securitynational mortgage under the indemnification agreement 
this deposit is in addition to a  deposit that securitynational mortgage made to lehman brothers and aurora loan services on december   for a total of  losses from mortgage loans with alleged breaches are payable by securitynational mortgage from the reserve account 
however  lehman brothers and aurora loan services are not to apply any funds from the reserve account to a particular mortgage loan until an actual loss has occurred 
the indemnification agreement further provides that aurora loan services will be entitled to have hold back basis points on any mortgage loans that lehman brothers or aurora loan services purchases from securitynational mortgage and to add the amount of the basis point holdbacks to the reserve account 
securitynational mortgage agreed to deliver to aurora loan services at least  in mortgage loans on an annual basis or at least  in months 
these provisions may not be effective  however  because lehman brothers and aurora loan services have discontinued purchasing mortgage loans from securitynational mortgage 
securitynational mortgage also agrees to pay to aurora loan services the difference between the reserve account balance and  but in no event will securitynational mortgage be required to pay any amount into the reserve account that would result in a total contribution  including both the basis point holdbacks and cash payments  in excess of  for any calendar month 
during and  securitynational mortgage made  in total payments to aurora loan services pursuant to the indemnification agreement 
during  securitynational mortgage made payments to aurora loan services of  when securitynational mortgage entered into the indemnification agreement  it anticipated using basis point holdbacks from loan production credits toward satisfying the  monthly obligations 
because lehman brothers and aurora loan services discontinued purchasing mortgage loans from securitynational mortgage shortly after the indemnification agreement was executed  securitynational mortgage has not had the benefit of using the basis point holdbacks toward payment of the  monthly obligations 
since the reserve account was established in  funds have been paid out of the account to indemnify  in losses from mortgage loans that were among the mortgage loans with alleged breaches which were listed on the attachment to the indemnification agreement and ten other mortgage loans with alleged breaches which were not listed on the attachment 
the estimated potential loss from of the remaining mortgage loans  which would allegedly require indemnification by securitynational mortgage for such losses  is  an additional six mortgage loans listed on the attachment to the indemnification agreement are not included among the remaining loans because securitynational mortgage has not yet received repurchase demands in regards to such loans 
during  and  the company recognized alleged losses of   and  respectively 
however  management cannot fully determine the total losses because there are losses concerning the rights of the company that need to be determined  including the rights that the company may have as a result of lehman brothers and aurora loan services refusal to purchase subsequent loans from securitynational mortgage soon after the indemnification agreement was executed 
the company has not accrued for losses under the indemnification agreement as of december  the company is currently involved in discussions with lehman brothers as to issues under the indemnification agreement 
during the discussions  the monthly payments for december and january  february  march and april totaling  have been abated or deferred  as the case may be  with the consent of lehman brothers 
citimortgage on november   a complaint was filed in the united states district court  eastern district of missouri  by citimortgage  inc against securitynational mortgage company 
the complaint claimed that at various times since may  securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans to citimortgage that did not meet requirements under certain agreements between citimortgage and securitynational mortgage  the complaint specifically addressing mortgage loans 
the complaint further alleged that with respect to the mortgage loans  securitynational mortgage refused to cure these alleged nonconforming mortgage loans or to repurchase such loans 
because of securitynational mortgage s alleged failure to comply with its repurchase obligations in such agreements  the complaint contended that securitynational mortgage owed citimortgage in excess of  the complaint also requested an order requiring securitynational mortgage to perform its obligations under the agreements with citimortgage  including to repurchase the defective mortgage loans 
securitynational mortgage disputed the claims that citimortgage asserted in the complaint 
on february   securitynational mortgage and citimortgage reached a settlement on the disputed claims 
the settlement covered the mortgage loans in the complaint and  in addition  other mortgage loans that citimortgage purchased from securitynational mortgage 
under the terms of the settlement agreement and release  securitynational mortgage paid a settlement amount to citimortgage 
the company reserved a sufficient amount to cover the settlement payment in its consolidated financial statements at december the settlement agreement and release specifically provides that securitynational mortgage and citimortgage fully release each other from any and all claims  liabilities and causes of action that each had or may have had against the other concerning the mortgage loans identified in the complaint and the other mortgage loans that citimortgage purchased from securitynational mortgage prior to the date of the agreement 
the agreement does not extend to any mortgage loans purchased by citimortgage after the effective date of the settlement agreement nor to claims by borrowers 
mortgage loan loss settlement discussions bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase there have been assertions in third party investor correspondence that securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults  or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with agreements between securitynational mortgage and the third party investors 
as a result of these claims  third party investors  including bank of america countrywide home loans  inc bank of america  wells fargo funding  inc wells fargo and jp morgan chase bank emc mortgage corp 
jp morgan chase  have made demands that securitynational mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans 
as of december   bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase have asserted estimated potential claims of  relating to loan repurchases  loan indemnifications and other loan issues 
the company has estimated the potential losses for the asserted claims by these banks to be less 
the company has reserved and accrued  as of december  to settle all such investor related claims 
the company believes this amount is adequate to resolve these claims and the amount represents the company s estimate of possible losses relating to any outstanding claims by these banks 
these claims are greater than the net asset value of securitynational mortgage  which was  on december   and its reserve for mortgage loan loss  which was  on december  the company disagrees with the claims asserted by bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase against securitynational mortgage and believes it has significant defenses to these claims 
securitynational mortgage was involved in settlement discussions with bank of america during the second and third quarters of  and is currently involved in settlement discussions with wells fargo in an attempt to settle the claims asserted by the banks 
on march   securitynational mortgage received a proposed settlement agreement and release from wells fargo 
securitynational mortgage is currently evaluating the terms of the proposed agreement 
the proposed settlement was considered in the company s determination of its loan loss reserve 
any additional loss in excess of the current loan loss reserve cannot be estimated as negotiations are still in progress 
it is possible that the negotiations could result in a change in the estimate of the loan loss reserve 
if securitynational mortgage is unable to negotiate acceptable terms with bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase  legal action may ensue in an effort to obtain amounts that the banks claim are allegedly due 
in the event of legal action  if securitynational mortgage is not successful in its defenses against claims asserted by these banks to the extent that a substantial judgment was entered against securitynational mortgage that is beyond its capacity to pay  securitynational mortgage may be required to curtail or cease operations 
termination of business relationship with bank of america during settlement discussions with bank of america during the second and third quarters of  bank of america made a settlement proposal to securitynational mortgage 
when securitynational mortgage declined to accept the settlement proposal  which it regarded as unreasonable and onerous  bank of america notified securitynational mortgage by letter dated october   of its decision to terminate its business relationship with securitynational mortgage 
in particular  the letter provided notice of termination of the loan purchase agreement  dated september   between securitynational mortgage and countrywide funding corporation 
as a result  bank of america is no longer accepting any new commitments for mortgage loans from securitynational mortgage 
however  bank of america completed the purchase of mortgage loans from securitynational mortgage involving mortgage loan commitments that had been made before october  bank of america also stated in the october  letter that termination of its business relationship with securitynational mortgage would not affect the obligations  representations  warranties or indemnifications by securitynational mortgage under mortgage loans previously sold to bank of america under the loan purchase agreement 
accompanying the termination letter to securitynational mortgage was a notice letter from bank of america  also dated october  in the notice letter bank of america stated that it was withdrawing all prior and pending settlement proposals involving securitynational mortgage and the company 
bank of america further stated that it intended to exercise certain rights under the loan purchase agreement by debiting  from amounts in the over under account that it had been holding for the benefit of securitynational mortgage 
bank of america also maintained it had the right to debit additional amounts credited to the over under account for payment of additional obligations that securitynational mortgage allegedly owed to bank of america 
the company believes that bank of america wrongfully applied the  from the over under account toward payment of outstanding obligations that securitynational mortgage allegedly owed to bank of america 
in a letter dated october  to bank of america  securitynational mortgage stated  without waiving any of its rights against bank of america  that it objected to bank of america debiting  from the over under account  as well as any amount attempted to be debited thereafter without specific written approval of securitynational mortgage 
securitynational mortgage had sent letters to bank of america requesting a withdrawal of funds from the over under account before bank of america had debited the  from the account 
securitynational mortgage recognized this withdrawal of funds by bank of america by reducing the balance of securitynational mortgage s accrued losses on loans sold a liability account and its restricted cash held by bank of america 
securitynational mortgage is currently determining what action to take against bank of america for wrongfully debiting the funds from the over under account 
as a result of the termination of the business relationship with bank of america  securitynational mortgage will have less flexibility on pricing when selling mortgage loans to third party investors 
in addition  with the loss of bank of america s early purchase program for mortgage loans sold to bank of america  it will take longer for securitynational mortgage to sell its mortgage loans to third party investors

the purpose of the funeral plan policy is to pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of the person s death 
on a per thousand dollar cost of insurance basis these policies can be more expensive to the policy holder than many types of non burial insurance due to their low face amount  requiring the fixed cost of the policy administration be distributed over a smaller policy size  and the simplified underwriting practices that result in higher mortality costs

significant accounting policies the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting  asset liability duration matching  sound actuarial practices  adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges

mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with gaap related to sales of financial assets 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors  and include the fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  amount of death and surrender benefits  and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
value of business acquired value of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of receivables due on mortgage loans sold to investors  cemetery and mortuary operations  mortgage loan operations and other receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issue that would impact recovery of the cemetery and mortuary receivables is the overall economy 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have significant policy initiation fees front end load that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
the company  through its cemetery and mortuary operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage allowance for loan loss and loan loss reserve the company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses a contra asset account and through the mortgage loan loss reserve a liability account 
the allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the company s mortgage loans held for investment 
the allowance is comprised of two components 
the first component is an allowance for collectively evaluated impairment that is based upon the company s historical experience in collecting similar receivables 
the second component is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired 
upon determining impairment the company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral 
when a mortgage loan is past due more than days  the company  where appropriate  sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral 
once a loan is past due more than days the company does not accrue any interest income and proceeds to foreclose on the real estate 
all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred 
once foreclosed the carrying value will approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate 
the company carries the foreclosed property in security national life  memorial estates and securitynational mortgage  its life  cemeteries and mortuaries and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is deemed desirable to sell them 
the company is currently able to rent properties at a to gross return 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
the company s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
upon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale  the company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions 
the company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production 
this estimate is based on the company s historical experience 
the amount accrued for and the charge to expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and doubtful accounts and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
deferred compensation the company has deferred compensation agreements with several of its current and past executive officers 
the deferred compensation is payable upon retirement or death of these individuals either in annual installments ten years or lump sum settlement  if approved by the board of directors 
the company has accrued the present value of these benefits based upon their future retirement dates and other factors  on its consolidated financial statements 
depreciation depreciation is calculated principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain casualty insurance  workers compensation and liability programs 
self insurance reserves are maintained relative to these programs 
the level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverages 
when estimating the self insurance liabilities and related reserves  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided independent third party actuaries 
management reviews its assumptions with its independent third party administrators and actuaries to evaluate whether the self insurance reserves are adequate 
if actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates  additional reserves may be required 
the estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date

risks the following is a description of the most significant risks facing the company and how it mitigates those risks legal and regulatory risks the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the company operates will create additional expenses and or risks not anticipated by the company in developing and pricing its products 
that is  regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits  new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the company s mortgage sales 
also  the company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery mortuary business 
the company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations  thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction  and also by employing underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks 
mortgage industry risks developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets adversely affected the company s ability to sell certain of its mortgage loans to investors  which impacted the company s financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing many of these loans 
as a result of the volatile secondary market  for mortgage loans  the company sold mortgage loans in and to certain third party investors  including lehman brothers aurora loan services and bear stearns emc mortgage corp  that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of such loans was  of which  were loans in which the secondary market no longer exists 
due to these changes in circumstances  the company regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of assets from former transferees in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment purposes  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for chargeoffs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the  and financial statements reflect the transfer of the mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
the company s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
upon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale  the company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions 
the company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on the company s historical experience 
the amounts accrued for loan losses in years ended december   and were   and  respectively  and the charge to expense has been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and  as of december  and  the balances were  and  respectively 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of december  however  there is a risk that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserves and allowances 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount   of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received or recognized any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company increased its allowance for mortgage losses by  and  respectively  which was charged to loan loss expense and included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the period 
the allowances for mortgage loan losses as of december  and were  and  respectively 
see footnote in the consolidated financial statement for schedule of mortgage loan loss reserves 
also at december   the company had foreclosed on a total of  in long term mortgage loans  of which  of the loans foreclosed were reclassified as other real estate held for investment or sale during the company carries the foreclosed properties in security national life  memorial estates  and securitynational mortgage  its respective life  cemeteries and mortuaries  and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them 
the company is exposed to the risk that certain third party purchasers could have claims against the company requiring it to repurchase alleged defective mortgage loans or to indemnify such purchasers against any losses related to such loans 
in particular  there have been assertions in third party purchaser correspondence that securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans that contained alleged misrepresentations or that experienced early payment defaults  or that were otherwise defective or not in compliance with agreements between securitynational mortgage and the third party investors 
as a result of these claims  certain third party investors  including bank of america countrywide home loans  inc  wells fargo funding  inc  and jp morgan chase emc mortgage corp  have made demands that securitynational mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans 
as of december   bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase have asserted estimated potential claims of  relating to loan repurchases  loan indemnifications and other loan issues 
the company has estimated the potential losses for the asserted claims by these banks to be less 
the company has reserved and accrued  as of december  to settle all such investor related claims 
the company believes this amount is adequate to resolve these claims and the amount represents the company s estimate of possible losses relating to any outstanding claims by these banks 
these claims are greater than the net asset value of securitynational mortgage  which was  on december   and its reserve for mortgage loan loss  which was  on december  the company disagrees with the claims asserted by bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase against securitynational mortgage and believes it has significant defenses to these claims 
securitynational mortgage was involved in settlement discussions with bank of america during the second and third quarters of  and is currently involved in settlement discussions with wells fargo in an attempt to settle the claims asserted by the banks 
on march   securitynational mortgage received a proposed settlement agreement and release from wells fargo 
securitynational mortgage is currently evaluating the terms of the proposed agreement 
the proposed settlement was considered in the company s determination of its loan loss reserve 
any additional loss in excess of the current loan loss reserve cannot be estimated as negotiations are still in progress 
it is possible that the negotiations could result in a change in the estimate of the loan loss reserve 
if securitynational mortgage is unable to negotiate acceptable terms with bank of america  wells fargo and jp morgan chase  legal action may ensue in an effort to obtain amounts that the banks claim are allegedly due 
in the event of legal action  if securitynational mortgage is not successful in its defenses against claims asserted by these banks to the extent that a substantial judgment was entered against securitynational mortgage that is beyond its capacity to pay  securitynational mortgage may be required to curtail or cease operations 
florida insurance business after several months of discussions with the florida office of insurance regulation concerning the categorization of certain admitted assets  security national life received a letter dated june   in which florida indicated its rejection of security national life position and requested that security national life either infuse additional capital or cease writing new business in the state of florida 
florida s decision was based upon excess investments in subsidiaries by security national life and florida s determination to classify as property acquired and held for the purposes of investment  certain real property that security national life acquired in satisfaction of creditor rights and subsequently rented to tenants 
these determinations resulted in security national life exceeding certain investment limitations under florida law and in a corresponding capital and surplus deficiency as of march  florida has acknowledged that the deficiency may be cured by the infusion of additional capital in the amount of the excess investments 
security national life strongly disagrees with florida s interpretation of the florida statutes  including florida s opinion that  of real property that security national life acquired in satisfaction of creditor rights as of march  must be included in an investment category that is subject to a limitation of only of admitted assets which category consists of real estate acquired and held for investment purposes rather than in the investment category that is subject to a limitation of of admitted assets which category includes real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans  mortgages  or debts 
in rendering its opinion  florida did not suggest that the real property assets of security national life are not fairly stated 
the letter further stated that security national life may not resume writing insurance in florida until such time as it regains full compliance with florida law and receives written approval from florida authorizing it to resume writing insurance 
on june   security national life responded by letter to florida and expressed its disagreement with florida s interpretation of the florida statutes but  for practical purposes  agreed  beginning as of june  and continuing until florida determines that security national life has attained full compliance with the florida statutes  to cease originating new insurance policies in florida and not to enter into any new reinsurance agreements with any florida domiciled insurance company 
the state of utah  security national life s state of domicile  has not determined security national life to have a capital and surplus deficiency  nor is security national life aware of any state  other than florida  in which security national life is determined to have a capital and surplus deficiency 
during  the annualized premiums for new insurance policies written by security national life in florida were  or of the total amount of  in annualized premiums for new insurance policies written by security national life during the same period 
security national life is considering preparing an application to be submitted to florida for approval of a florida only subsidiary for all new insurance business written in florida 
security national life believes that if florida were to approve a florida only subsidiary  security national life would be able to resume writing new insurance policies in florida in full compliance with the florida statutes relating to investments in real estate and subsidiaries 
interest rate risk the risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the company s investments or impair the ability of the company to market its mortgage and cemetery mortuary products 
this change in rates may cause certain interest sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation 
the company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non conformance with certain policy provisions  by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser  and or by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities 
to the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature  the company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale 
mortality morbidity risk the risk that the company s actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality morbidity experience may cause the company s products to be underpriced  may cause the company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated and other potentially adverse consequences to the business 
the company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices  asset liability duration matching  and sound actuarial practices 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and claims  those used in determining valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  construction loans  estimate of probable loan loss reserve  and other receivables  and those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre need sales 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
during the twelve months ended december   the company operations used cash of  while cash totaling  was provided by operations during the twelve months ended december  this was due primarily to a  increase in and an increase of  in in the balance of mortgage loans sold to investors and a  decrease in and an increase of  in in the balance of other liabilities and accrued expenses  a  increase in and an increase of  in in the provision for losses on accounts receivable and loans 
the company s liability for future life  annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over long term due to the company s market niche of selling funeral plans 
funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person s death 
a person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person s death 
because of the long term nature of these liabilities the company is able to hold to maturity its bonds  real estate and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return  which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this represents and of the total investments as of december   and december   respectively 
generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds 
at december   or  and at december   or  of the company s total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six  which are considered non investment grade 
the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities 
the amortized cost and contractual payments on mortgage loans on real estate and construction loans held for investment by category as of december  are shown below 
expected principal payments may differ from contractual obligations because certain borrowers may elect to pay off mortgage obligations with or without early payment penalties 
principal principal principal amounts amounts amounts due in due in due total thereafter residential residential construction commercial total if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately  could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique bps bps bps bps change in market value in thousands the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december   and december   the life insurance subsidiary exceeded the regulatory criteria 
the company s total capitalization of stockholders equity  and bank debt and notes payable were  as of december   as compared to  as of december  stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was and as of december  and december   respectively 
bank debt and notes payable decreased  for the twelve months ended december  when compared to december   thus increasing the stockholders equity percentage 
lapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period 
the company s lapse rate for life insurance in was as compared to a rate of for at december    of the company s consolidated stockholders equity represents the statutory stockholders equity of the company s life insurance subsidiaries 
the life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to its parent company without the approval of insurance regulatory authorities 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their businesses without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
this annual report of form k contains forward looking statements  together with related data and projections  about the company s projected financial results and its future plans and strategies
