item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion addresses the principal factors affecting the company s financial condition and operations during the past three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the five year financial summary found in item and item of this report 
overview the company is a diversified communications company located primarily in the southeastern united states 
it is committed to providing high quality local content in growth markets over multiple platforms  to continually developing new products and services tailored to customer preferences  and to sustaining traditional media audience viewership while simultaneously seeking an increased share of digital audiences 
regardless of the delivery platform  content information is the product that the company provides and the individual markets take their cues about customers distinct needs and preferences 
the importance of addressing these specific marketplace needs resulted in a change in the company s management and operating configuration from a platform focused structure to a market based structure comprised of five geographic segments along with a sixth segment that includes interactive advertising services and certain other operations at the beginning of the third quarter of by focusing resources in a designated geographic market  the company remains in tune with its customers advertisers and consumers and as a result  its products evolve in harmony with the needs of the marketplace 
the company s strategic objective is to drive profitable growth across multiple platforms by engaging with communities on their own terms and by developing effective marketing opportunities that connect advertisers to the prospective customers they want to reach 
the company continues to build upon its digital first approach to news reporting and content gathering  leveraging mobile and the internet as the immediate platforms for distribution of breaking news and positioning digital media in each of its markets for strong  long term audience growth 
the company has expanded certain key strategic partnerships with yahoo and zillow to include its television markets 
in early  the company began selling recruitment advertising co branded with monster 
the company has also forged new partnerships with fast growing online businesses such as groupon  which offers daily advertising deals under local brands 
these relationships with both emerging and established online brands present promising new revenue growth opportunities 
additionally  the company is a founding member of a group of local and national broadcasters that are working to develop over the air television to mobile devices 
over time  this technology has the potential to expand the company s broadcast audience and provide new revenue streams from both subscription packages and advertising 
a component of accelerating the company s digital strategy includes a renewed focus on regaining a portion of lost advertising  particularly classified advertising  by selling online simultaneously with mobile  video  and other new media  the company is utilizing all of its resources and is making progress towards that goal 
while the signs of a weakening economy were noticeable toward the end of and more pronounced throughout the following year  ushered in nearly unprecedented economic turmoil 
in  the economic climate remained daunting with only small signs of recovery as the year progressed 
the economy in could be described as precariously stabilized  but this was in comparison to several tumultuous prior years 
most companies  and particularly those in the media industry  were directly impacted by reduced consumer confidence and lower advertiser spending levels 
the company s florida market was the first of the company s markets to be significantly affected  as a housing induced recession in florida which began in late served as an indicator of what was to follow throughout the country  unfortunately  the company s other markets ultimately felt the same effects 
while most markets have begun to moderate  if not recover  the florida market has been slow to rebound as local real estate values continue to struggle 
over the past four years  the company has heeded these economic indicators and has responded with aggressive cost reductions intended to bring its cost structure in line with revenue expectations 
advertising sales comprise the majority of the company s revenues 
the distribution of advertising revenues in the united states continues to shift among numerous established media  as well as many new entrants  resulting in intense competition 
the company faces challenges from internet competition  from structural changes in industries that have historically been major purchasers of print advertising  from cautious advertisers  and from the cyclical nature of certain advertising which translates into the relative absence of political and olympics advertising for television stations in odd numbered years 
the company recognizes that it is part of an industry in transition  particularly regarding the packaging and delivery of information 
while the company is mindful of the pace and intensity of a shift away from traditional print advertising  it also recognizes that this transformation offers new opportunities  revenue streams and customer prospects 
the role of digital media continues to evolve at a rapid pace  and the company believes it is strategically positioned to capitalize on the resultant opportunities 

table of contents certain pending climate change and other environmental laws and regulations could impact the company if enacted or adopted by potentially increasing its operating costs through higher electricity and other expenses associated with its facilities and  possibly  by increasing the cost of newsprint  the company s most significant raw material 
climate change effects could include more intense tropical storms  tornadoes and hurricanes potentially causing lost revenue and higher expenses associated with storms because of the concentration of the company s operations in the southeastern united states  as discussed in item a of this form k 
in the beginning of  the company amended and extended its existing bank debt  and issued senior notes 
these actions provide the company with greater financial flexibility and further strengthen its financial position over the long term even as it navigates the short term weakness in the economy 
for a more detailed discussion surrounding these actions  see the liquidity section of this management s discussion analysis md a 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that management make various estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if that estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of the board of directors has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates 
while actual results could differ from accounting estimates  the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas intangible assets the company reviews the carrying values of both goodwill and other identified indefinite lived intangible assets  including fcc licenses  as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year  or if events indicate an impairment may have arisen  utilizing discounted cash flow models and market based models 
the preparation of discounted cash flow models requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue growth  compensation levels  newsprint prices  capital expenditures  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
the preparation of market based models requires the collection of estimated peer company data as to revenues and ebitda  as well as an assessment of enterprise values by looking at stock prices and debt levels 
these key assumptions for both the discounted cash flow and market based models work in concert with one another 
changes to one variable may necessitate changes to other variables 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
during the annual impairment test  the company revisited the number of reporting units contained in each segment and further aggregated reporting units for goodwill testing based on the similar nature of products  customers and long term financial performance indicators  among other factors 
all reporting units are one level below the operating segment  with the exception of the florida and ohio rhode island markets 
no reallocation of goodwill was necessary 
all reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test 
however  one reporting unit within each of the mid south  north carolina  and virginia tennessee markets are at risk of failing future goodwill impairment tests as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by less than as of september  allocated goodwill of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  is at risk 
the key assumptions for all reporting units with at risk goodwill include those relating to revenue growth  compensation levels  benefit costs  newsprint prices  capital expenditures  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
as of the end of  the company s carrying value of fcc licenses was million  and no impairment was noted based on the annual impairment test 
the models the company uses to value fcc licenses are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions including long term revenue growth  operating margins and initial capital expenditures 

table of contents since the estimated fair values that arise in both the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based on the company s performance and stock prices  peer company performance and stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets  future impairment charges of both goodwill and fcc licenses are possible 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the determination of the liabilities and cost of the company s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and postretirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and are compared with external benchmarks  historical trends  and the company s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates health care cost trends retirement rates expected contributions a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in pension expense for of approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have raised or lowered the plans expense by less than million and would have changed the plans projected obligations by approximately to million as of the end of in  the company took the final steps to fully freeze all benefits under its retirement plans 
effective april   the company suspended the k match in its defined contribution plan from of an employee s salary 
effective january   the company reinstated the match up to a maximum of of an employee s salary 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs  and automobile and general liability claims with specified stop loss provisions for high dollar claims 
the company estimates the liabilities for these items approximately million at december  based on historical experience and advice from actuaries and claim administrators 
actual claims experience as well as changes in health care cost trends could result in the company s eventual cost differing from this estimate 
income taxes the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is regularly audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various tax agencies and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of these audits 
the company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions  where the probability exceeds a more likely than not standard 
the reserve for uncertain tax positions was million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the company records income tax expense using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company ordinarily bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates as well as expected future income 
however  the company was in a net deferred tax asset position at the end of both and and  although the company fully expects to utilize the underlying tax benefits  it could not assume future taxable income due to a cumulative book loss in recent years the direct result of non cash intangible asset impairment charges 
the company therefore established a valuation allowance 

table of contents due to the requirements of accounting interpretations related to the company s amortization of intangible assets for income tax purposes  the company anticipates recording an additional deferred tax valuation allowance of million  million and million in   and  respectively  as compared to million in the additional valuation allowance will be recorded as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
an explanation of this additional valuation allowance as well as a description of the situation and events that would alter it are described more fully in note of item of this form k 
significant changes in enacted federal and state tax laws or in expected future earnings could impact income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the valuation allowance 
summary management believes  given current facts and circumstances  supplemented by the expertise and concurrence of external resources  including actuaries  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and in accordance with gaap 
management further believes that the assumptions and estimates actually used in the financial statements  taken as a whole  represent the most appropriate choices from among reasonably possible alternatives and fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
management will continue to discuss key estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations net income the company recorded net losses of million per share  million per share and million per share in  and  respectively 
in order to facilitate a meaningful discussion of comparative results for the last three years  several and items merit separate consideration 
the company recorded pretax impairment charges totaling million and million in and  respectively  due to challenging business conditions  the delayed economic recovery and market perception of the value of media companies 
for additional information regarding these impairment charges  see note in item of this form k 
the company completed the sale of a fifth and final held for sale television station as well as a small business magazine in  the first four television stations were sold in the company recorded an after tax gain of million in and an after tax loss of million in related to these divestitures 
results of the sold television stations and their related websites and the business magazine have been reported as discontinued operations for all years presented 
see note of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s acquisitions and divestitures 
the company also consummated the sale of sp newsprint company spnc in the second quarter of which generated proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in  a small adverse adjustment related to working capital was recognized as was a small favorable resolution of a retained liability for an income tax dispute at spnc 
the total pretax impact of the sp newsprint operations was income of 
million in and a loss of million in see note in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the spnc sale 
the remainder of this discussion focuses only on results from continuing operations 
as the economy began to deteriorate  the company implemented various cost reduction plans  which included voluntary and non voluntary separation programs  in an effort to better align its costs with the declining business environment 
these workforce reductions were in response to a general economic downturn  and particularly to the deep housing induced recession in the florida market 
full time equivalent employees were reduced by approximately  employees during  and by an additional employees by the close of to approximately  employees 
as the company trimmed its workforce  severance costs of million  million and million were included in operating expenses for  and  respectively 
additionally  the company implemented a mandatory employee furlough program in whereby most employees had days of unpaid leave in that year 
in  the company s improved operating performance led management to reimburse of the equivalent of days of furlough to participating employees 

table of contents the company had a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared to a loss of million in however  this year over year comparison included the ramifications of a complex tax situation as well as the prior year million pretax impairment charge discussed earlier 
the company recorded income tax expense related to continuing operations of million in as compared to an income tax benefit of million in in  the company s tax provision had an unusual relationship to its pretax income from continuing operations of million primarily due to the existence of a full deferred tax valuation allowance and a deferred tax liability that could not be used to offset deferred tax assets termed a naked credit 
for a more detailed discussion of the events and circumstances surrounding this non cash naked credit  see the income taxes section of this md a and note in item of this form k 
the company recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in as compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in excluding the million pretax impairment charge 
the largest factors in these year over year results were a increase in interest expense reflecting the new financing structure put into place in february  which was virtually offset by an equally significant improvement in segment operating results 
this million increase in segment operating profits in from the prior year was principally attributable to a increase in revenues driven in large part by strong political advertising combined with a decrease in segment operating costs 
segment expenses were held in check primarily due to lower costs in the areas of newsprint  benefits  and depreciation and amortization 
however  corporate expense was up due principally to the impact of employee furlough days and the absence of a million gain from resulting from the final freeze of retirement plans 
additionally  total operating costs in were favorably impacted by substantially higher fixed asset sale gains 
the company had a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in  excluding the pretax effect of impairment charges in both periods  produced income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  and resulted in income from continuing operations before income taxes of 
million 
a significant aspect of this year over year improvement was a decrease in operating expenses  which more than offset an decrease in revenues 
revenues suffered declines in all advertising categories and across all markets  with the exception of subscription content circulation revenues  which was the only category to meaningfully advance due to higher subscription rates and expanded cable retransmission revenues 
sizeable cost savings were achieved through a combination of factors including a mandatory employee furlough program  suspension of the company match on the k plan in april  and lower employee counts  all of which led to reduced compensation costs  a decline in intangibles amortization expense due to the impairment write downs of network affiliation agreement intangibles  and decreased newsprint expense 
additionally  various gains played a role in year over year comparisons such as a million curtailment gain in associated with a final freeze on retirement plans  a 
million net gain in due primarily to a favorable tax ruling in connection with a retained liability from the sale of spnc as compared to a million loss in  million of gains in due to the sprint nextel broadcast equipment conversion  as compared to a million gain in  and a million gain in associated with an insurance recovery  as compared to a million gain for a separate recovery in the broadcast equipment and insurance gains are discussed more fully in note of item of this form k 
segment results the geographically managed segments are virginia tennessee  florida  mid south  north carolina  and ohio rhode island 
a sixth segment includes the company s interactive advertising services and certain other operations 
geographic markets revenues revenues are grouped primarily into five major categories local  national  political  classified  and subscription content circulation which includes newspaper circulation  broadcast retransmission revenues  and interactive subscription and content revenues 
the following chart summarizes the year over year changes in these select revenue categories change in market revenue by major category versus versus in thousands amount percent amount percent local national classified political  nm  subs content circulation nm is not meaningful 

table of contents as illustrated in the previous chart  broadcast political advertising time sales are typically higher in even numbered years as a result of the national and statewide political races which generate additional advertising dollars 
these events  or their absence in a given year  cause a certain cyclicality which is demonstrated in the following graph showing political advertising as a percentage of total television time sales 
accordingly  and yielded higher political advertising revenues  which were in sharp contrast to with little deviation from historical trend  political time sales in exceeded six and one half times the prior year level due to strong spending associated with us congressional races and issue spending in certain states 
logo while robust political revenues made the strongest contribution to the company s improved year over year revenues in  increased national advertising also reflected an overall firming in broadcast transactional business 
national advertising was also bolstered by image ads run by bp throughout regarding the oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
over the past three years  local and classified revenues were down year over year due primarily to lower newspaper advertising 
in  local advertising fell just short of the prior year amount  reflecting a solid broadcast performance despite some displacement of transactional advertising by political issue and candidate spending 
classified advertising continued to struggle and had a greater impact in markets where there was a heavier mix of newspapers 
subscription content circulation revenues were flat in due to decreased newspaper circulation  but made meaningful progress in as a rise in cable and satellite retransmission revenues contributed approximately two thirds of the growth  and an increase in newspaper circulation revenue the result of higher rates was responsible for the remainder 
while not yet a major revenue category  the company s printing distribution operations have continued to expand and are becoming an increasingly important contributor to overall revenues 
year over year comparisons were also directly affected by the winter olympics and the summer olympics which generated more than million and million  respectively  in advertising in those years 
revenues in the virginia tennessee market fell in and in compared to the prior years 
with the exception of political  advertising dollars were down across all categories 
in and  classified advertising fell by approximately and  respectively  and was the largest contributor to the year over year declines 
national and local advertising fell a combined in and in from the equivalent prior year periods 
conversely  revenues from third party printing and distribution produced double digit growth in both years 
partially offsetting weak advertising revenues in were strong subscription content circulation revenues  which showed solid growth due to both rate increases across all newspapers and to strong broadcast retransmission revenues 

table of contents revenues in the florida market were down almost in and in from the equivalent prior year periods 
in  political advertising was robust as a result of florida s hotly contested gubernatorial  congressional  and attorney general races  combined with issue spending 
despite these strong political revenues  the continued soft housing market and high unemployment in the tampa bay area remained a factor in the market s overall revenue performance 
classified  local and national advertising were down  and  respectively  in from the prior year 
in  advertising declined across all categories by double digits 
this decrease represented approximately one third of the total consolidated revenue decline in  reflecting the significantly weakened advertising environment across all sources of advertising dollars at that time 
revenues in the mid south market rose in but fell in compared to prior years 
with of the company s network affiliated television stations  the mid south market is significantly influenced by political advertising 
following trend  strong political advertising resulting from both primary and general election spending provided the lion s share of the year over year improvement in  however  an approximate increase in both local and national advertising contributed as well 
success was also achieved from new printing and distribution arrangements which grew more than in as compared to the prior year 
in  local advertising was down farthest from the prior year level  with decreased national and political revenues comprising the majority of the remaining shortfall 
political advertising declined nearly in s off election year as compared to strong subscription content circulation revenues in partially offset the other revenue shortfalls in that year 
revenues in the north carolina market decreased in and in from the comparable periods in and while both years suffered declines in local and classified advertising  the magnitude of the declines in these categories was much more amplified in in  local down and classified down advertising declines were significantly better than the comparable local and classified decreases in from political advertising almost tripled in over the prior year due primarily to congressional and senate races and higher issue spending 
national advertising regained its footing in and improved over the prior year 
as was the case in many markets  subscription content circulation revenues held steady in but showed solid improvement in from the prior year on increased cable and satellite retransmission revenues 
revenues in the ohio rhode island market increased in  but decreased in from this is the company s only geographic market that does not include any newspaper operations and is consequently less influenced by classified advertising  but more affected by the ebb and flow of political and olympics revenues in corresponding odd and even numbered years 
both of this market s television stations are nbc affiliates and  consequently  reaped the full benefit of winter olympics advertising 
in  political advertising provided the largest contribution to this segment s revenue improvement  conversely  the lack of political advertising produced the greatest shortfalls in as compared to the prior year 
political advertising advances in were the result of gubernatorial and congressional elections  combined with intense issue spending 
in  strong national advertising up and solid local advertising up in this broadcast intensive market gave credence to an overall strengthening in broadcast transactional business 
in  subscription content circulation revenues were the only revenue category in this market that showed year over year improvement due to increases in retransmission fees 
operating expenses over the past few years  the company has reacted to the challenging advertising environment by reducing costs across all markets while achieving greater efficiencies and implementing aggressive actions to better align expenses with current economic opportunities 
the company reduced its operating expenses by nearly in and by in excluding impairment charges 
cost containment remains important  but due to the large expense reductions in prior years  the company believes that the current structure is much more in line with current economic conditions 
instrumental in aligning expenses with the prevailing economic environment were workforce reductions across the entire company which resulted in an approximate decrease in full time equivalent employees from the end of to the end of as discussed previously  the company s results included pretax severance costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively  as the result of workforce reductions and consolidations at most operations 
in  total employee compensation expense decreased less than from the prior year due to reductions in force  lower medical spending  and a full year of suspended k match versus nine 
table of contents months in  which were virtually offset by costs associated with the absence of furlough days in and new or promoted employees 
total employee compensation expense decreased a substantial in from the prior year due to the combination of several factors  including lower employee counts  the elimination of positions at virtually every location  lower commissions and mandatory unpaid furlough days in newsprint expense decreased and in and  respectively  from the prior year due primarily to substantial reductions in consumption because of lower advertising linage  decreased circulation volumes  web width reductions and concerted conservation efforts 
the average cost per ton also decreased in and in depreciation and amortization expense was down in and in from the equivalent prior year periods as assets completing their depreciable lives outpaced new assets due to lower capital spending in recent years 
in  additional savings were derived in the areas of circulation  advertising sales and promotion across most markets 
operating expenses in the virginia tennessee market decreased in and in from the prior years 
lower compensation costs down in and in made up the largest portion of the operating expense decrease 
additionally  reductions in newsprint costs of in and in were responsible for a substantial part of the remaining decrease 
in an effort to respond to the economic challenges in the florida market  operating expenses shrank in that market by in and in  which represented over one third of the company s operating expense reduction in as compared to the prior year 
compensation expense fell by in and in newsprint costs decreased and in and  respectively 
additionally  depreciation and amortization expense declined in and in the florida market further reduced departmental costs approximately million in due to concerted cost reductions and postponement efforts across all areas of operations  particularly circulation and distribution costs 
operating expenses in the mid south market increased in and decreased in as compared to the prior years 
in  a increase in employee compensation expense was responsible for the market s increased year over year costs due not only to the absence of current year furlough days  but also to the market s strong performance which resulted in higher sales incentives and commissions 
in  of the reduced costs in the mid south market were attributable to lower compensation cost  with the majority of the remainder coming from intensive efforts to reduce departmental spending in all areas 
this market has a heavier mix of broadcast stations than newspapers and therefore  while newsprint costs were down  they were less significant to the overall cost savings than in other markets 
operating expenses decreased in and in in the north carolina market 
in  compensation costs were down as compared to the prior year  in  lower compensation costs accounted for more than half of the market s operating expense reduction 
lower newsprint costs down in and in  combined with reduced depreciation and amortization expense as well as lower departmental spending in  contributed the remaining savings 
operating expenses in the ohio rhode island market increased in but decreased in compared to the prior year 
due to similar circumstances as those at the mid south market  improved current year performance in the ohio rhode island market led to higher sales incentives and commissions 
in  additional expense reductions were achieved in departmental spending in the areas of marketing and promotion 
newsprint was not a factor as the company does not publish any newspapers in the ohio rhode island market 
advertising services other advertising services other aso primarily includes blockdot designs and delivers interactive entertainment and advergaming technologies  dealtaker 
com a coupon and shopping website that was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of  netinformer a leading provider of wireless media and mobile marketing services purchased in the fourth quarter of  production services comprised primarily of a provider of broadcast equipment and studio design services 

table of contents revenues in the advertising services other segment decreased in as a result of revenue declines of at blockdot attributable to fewer advergaming projects and at dealtaker due to lower placement within search engine results  combined with the absence of certain products which are now either being managed in their respective geographic markets or have been discontinued 
the revenue shortfall from the prior year was partially offset by an increase in revenues in the production services operations due to higher sales and installation of broadcast equipment and  to a lesser degree  a revenue improvement at netinformer 
revenues in aso in were essentially even with the level  however  components within this segment showed significant fluctuations 
dealtaker 
com grew its revenues by more than in part because the company had only nine months of ownership in  reflecting increased traffic and visitors buying from merchant sites 
conversely  production services revenues declined as installation and service sales struggled to meet prior year levels 
operating costs were down approximately in and in in  higher costs associated with investments to grow the company s mobile business were more than offset by the absence of expenses associated with the previously mentioned products which are no longer in the aso segment 
the reduction in costs was due primarily to lower compensation costs 
additionally  lower cost of goods sold in that year was in line with the previously mentioned reduced volume of work at production services 
operating profit loss the following chart shows the change in operating profit loss by market  the year over year movement in market operating profit was driven by the underlying fluctuations in revenue and expense as detailed in the previous discussion 
change in operating profit loss versus versus in millions amount percent amount percent virginia tennessee florida mid south north carolina ohio rhode island advertising services other eliminations disc 
ops despite the continued challenges presented by a slow to recover economy  the company generated improved year over year total segment operating profits in for the first time since the company s broadcast intensive markets mid south and ohio rhode island made the largest contributions to the million increase in operating profits due in large part to vigorous political advertising 
the florida market also showed marked improvement which stemmed not only from robust political revenues which were unable to offset weakness in all other revenue categories  but also from a reduction in costs 
in  the north carolina  mid south  and ohio rhode island markets contributed the largest portion of the year over year operating profit shortfall 
while all of these markets were impacted by reduced advertising revenues  particularly local  the ohio rhode island and mid south markets were especially hard hit by the absence of olympics generated revenues and the virtual absence of political advertising 
weak classified revenues in the north carolina market contributed as well 
the virginia tennessee market showed only a small decline as lower revenues were tempered by reduced operating costs 
lower compensation and newsprint costs more than offset reduced revenues in the florida market to produce a million increase in year over year operating profits 

table of contents interest expense interest expense increased million in from the prior year as a direct result of the company s new financing structure that was completed in february nearly of the year over year increase in interest expense was attributable to debt issuance costs totaling million that were immediately expensed upon entering into the financing structure 
a million decline in average debt levels in as compared to the prior year only partially mitigated a basis point increase in the average interest rate excluding the impact of debt issuance costs immediately expensed 
see the liquidity section of this md a for a more detailed discussion of the new financing structure 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into three interest rate swaps where it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate to manage interest cost and cash flows associated with variable interest rates  primarily short term changes in libor  not to trade such instruments for profit or loss 
the interest rate swaps are carried at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis predicated on quoted libor prices of the estimated amounts the company would have received or paid to terminate the swaps 
these interest rate swaps are cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling million  swaps with notional amounts of million matured in  and the remaining million will mature in changes in cash flows of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the interest payments on the company s bank term loan 
these swaps effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate approximating at december  income taxes the company s tax rate in had an unusual relationship to pretax income from continuing operations primarily due to the existence of a full deferred tax valuation allowance 
income tax expense in was million  which reflects the accrual of a million valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets that is not available to offset existing deferred tax assets termed a naked credit  this accrual was partially offset by tax benefits related to an additional net operating loss nol carryback refund and a favorable settlement of a state income tax issue 
in contrast  the company reported an income tax benefit of million in and million in  reflecting an effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations of and  respectively 
the increase in the rate reflects a normalized tax rate attributed to a nol carryback benefit of approximately million and a tax benefit related to a favorable outcome in a state income tax case  as well as the intraperiod tax allocation rules 
the relatively low rate in was due principally to the non deductible goodwill which could not be tax benefited that was included as a component of the impairment charge in that year 
as of december  and december  the company had a valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively  because cumulative pretax income in recent years was in an overall loss position principally due to non cash impairment charges 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to the additional valuation allowance required in connection with the naked credit 
see note in item of this form k for a complete discussion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
other the company has certain plans in place  mainly the supplemental k plan and the director s deferred compensation plan  which are designed to align the interests of the participants with those of the shareholders 
future fluctuations in the company s stock price could have a significant effect on the amount of expense recognized 
each change in the company s stock price as of december  would have affected the company s pretax income by approximately 
million 
liquidity the company s main source of liquidity remains its cash flow from operations 
although economic difficulties in recent years have adversely affected cash generation  the company s cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
changes in working capital accounts such as income taxes refundable and accrued expenses including interest as well as borrowings and repayments on company owned life insurance policies can and did have an impact on this amount from year to year as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows  but the underlying operating performance of the company remains the key component 
as of december  the company did not have a material amount available to borrow against its company owned life insurance policies 

table of contents the new dynamic is how the company s financing structure has evolved to interact with this core cash generation to provide additional liquidity 
historically  all cash flows were used to repay debt and then  if additional working capital was needed  it was borrowed from a large revolving credit facility 
while the company still has a revolving facility  it is smaller 
as of december   nothing was outstanding under that facility  and there was million of capacity available to be borrowed 
additionally  the company had a cash and cash equivalent balance of million 
the combination of cash flow from operations  the unused portion of the revolving credit facility  and cash on hand provide the company with the necessary liquidity entering  including the ability to make interest payments and contributions to its retirement plan early in the year 
the company produced annual operating cash flow operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization less non cash goodwill and other asset impairment and gains on insurance recoveries of million  million  and million  respectively  in   and an amount in this range is expected for interest payments are expected to utilize more than half that amount in other significant outflows will include capital expenditures and pension plan contributions 
capital expenditures have ranged from million to million over the past three years and are expected to be in that range again in retirement plan contributions have been in the million to million range over the last three years  with a similar range expected for debt agreements in february of  the company simultaneously amended and extended its bank debt and issued senior notes in a private placement those notes were registered publicly later in the year 
the proceeds from the senior notes  which mature in  were used to pay down existing bank credit facilities 
at the same time  the maturity of the bank facility was extended to march  and the operating covenants under the agreements were revised to provide additional financial flexibility for the company albeit with higher interest costs 
as of the end of  the company had in place with a syndicate of banks a million term loan that was fully drawn after considering million of debt repayment during the year and a revolving credit facility with availability of million and no outstanding balance 
also outstanding were senior notes with a par value of million that were sold at a discount and carried on the balance sheet at year end at million 
the amended bank credit facilities mature in march and bear an interest rate of libor plus a margin as of year end based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement

the bank term loan facility contains an annual requirement to use excess cash flow as defined within the agreement to repay debt 
other factors  such as the sale of assets  may also result in a mandatory prepayment of the bank term loan 
as of december   the company had no mandatory excess cash flow payments due to the voluntary prepayments made during in addition  the company was in compliance with all covenants and expects that the covenants will continue to be met 

table of contents in and  the company operated under credit facilities with a syndicate of banks that was originally established in at year end  the company s debt consisted of a modified revolving credit facility of million million outstanding and a term loan of million 
these facilities were set to mature in and contained leverage and interest coverage ratios 
thus the decline in operating performance adversely affected these ratios 
as the wider economy and the company s performance deteriorated during and  the company reduced its operating expenses though a series of increasing cost reduction and elimination efforts  sold its interest in spnc and certain television stations  and reduced capital expenditures 
in late  the company cut its quarterly dividend in half  in it indefinitely suspended the dividend 
additional actions in included suspending the match of the k plan effective april st  freezing benefits under its retirement plans  and implementing an employee furlough program whereby most employees had days of unpaid leave

it has taken necessary actions as noted in the preceding paragraph to remain compliant with all debt covenants 
in  the company is restoring a match to its k plan and has provided for merit based employee raises equating to of total salaries  the first such raises since the company will continue to monitor its revenues  expense levels  and debt covenants and will adjust its operations and capital expenditures as appropriate to maintain cash flow

the table that follows shows long term debt and other specified obligations of the company as of december  in millions payments due by periods contractual obligations total and beyond bank term loan facility principal interest senior notes principal interest operating leases broadcast film rights estimated benefit payments from company assets purchase obligations total specified obligations other than the estimated benefit payments from company assets and broadcast film rights disclosed above and discussed further below  the table excludes items contained in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheets  primarily because the ultimate timing and amount of these future payments is not determinable 
as disclosed in note of item of this form k  the company had a non current liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million at december  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or period in which the ultimate settlement of these uncertain tax positions will occur  therefore the contractual obligations table excludes this liability 
the bank term loan facility matures in march  however  there is an annual requirement to use excess cash flow to repay debt 
other factors such as the sale of assets may also result in a mandatory prepayment 
interest obligations presented above are based on the december libor plus a margin of and assume no prepayments of principal  actual interest payments could differ substantially 
the senior notes mature in february and cannot be prepaid until interest obligations presented above assume no prepayments of principal 
minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year 

table of contents broadcast film rights include both recorded short term and long term liabilities for programs which have been produced and unrecorded commitments to purchase film rights which are not yet available for broadcast 
actuarially estimated benefit payments under pension and other benefit plans expected to be funded directly from company assets through  which excludes expected contributions to the retirement plan 
the company currently expects to make contributions in the range of million and million to its qualified pension plan in  although current estimates of erisa minimums may be less 
a further discussion is included in the paragraph that follows this chart 
purchase obligations include all current liabilities not otherwise reported in the table that will require cash settlement  significant purchase commitments for fixed assets  and significant non ordinary course contract based obligations 
purchase obligations exclude the company s purchase commitment to spnc for newsprint as the contract is based on market prices which are highly volatile 
as indicated in note of item of this form k  the company is committed to purchase a minimum of approximately thousand tons of newsprint per year through from spnc 
the company s unfunded obligation under its pension plans improved a small amount see note of item of this form k due to a improvement in the value of plan assets offset by a increase in the plans liabilities  primarily because of a lower discount rate 
the company made contributions of million to its retirement plan in  which were in excess of the required minimum contributions  it currently anticipates making contributions in the range of to million in by making contributions before they are required as it has in the past the company expects to limit the ultimate amount that it will need to contribute 
many factors influence the required funding for the plan including the return on invested assets  funding requirements that are set forth by erisa in enacting the laws passed by congress  and the long term discount rates that are applied to the funds benefit liabilities 
the amounts shown in the preceding table do not reflect plan contributions 
if the factors noted above remain unchanged  the company s required contributions in subsequent years would be of a similar magnitude 
outlook for even though the economy is somewhat stronger than in prior years  there are still conflicting signals which inherently foster skepticism 
the company operates in a geographically focused structure that allows it to offer customers innovative solutions that better suit their needs 
the company s organizational structure strengthens and speeds its ability to react to customers needs based on their individual preferences 
advertising spending patterns continue to show signs of improvement  particularly in broadcast transactional sales 
despite the lack of political advertising revenues in  higher revenues are expected to be realized through several key initiatives including expanding the yahoo and zillow partnerships to television markets  selling mobile  video and other new media simultaneously within the company s classified offerings and partnering with groupon a localized deal of the day website 
however  expenses are also expected to rise with the return of merit increases and the k match  which will more than offset this revenue growth 
the company believes it is strategically positioned to build long term shareholder value by drawing cues as an information company from the marketplace 
these cues will influence not only new product offerings and delivery methods  but also offer new customer and market opportunities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with interest rates and newsprint costs 
the company is subject to interest rate fluctuations related to its debt obligations 
these fluctuations are managed by balancing the amount of fixed versus variable rate borrowings including the use of interest rate swaps as described more fully in note of item of this form k 
based on the variable rate debt outstanding during   and  a basis point change in interest rates would have altered pretax interest expense by approximately million  million  and million in   and respectively 
the decrease in exposure to changes in interest rates in was due to the refinancing that occurred in the first quarter in which included the issuance of million senior notes with a fixed interest rate of as well as a million reduction in long term debt during the company s interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million mature in the third quarter of  therefore a larger portion of the company s borrowings may be subject to variable interest rates in newsprint is a commodity whose price is subject to supply and demand imbalances 
with the sale of its interest in spnc in  the company is now solely a newsprint consumer 
newsprint expense represented   and of the company s production costs in   and  respectively 
focused solely on the number of tons consumed  a change in newsprint prices would have altered the company s newsprint expense in   and by approximately thousand to thousand
