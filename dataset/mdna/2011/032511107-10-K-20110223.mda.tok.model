increased natural gas sales volumes were partially offset by natural production declines in the gulf of mexico of mmcf d 
the company s daily natural gas sales volumes increased mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to increased production in the rockies of mmcf d due to positive results from dewatering coalbed methane wells and higher production uptime due to favorable weather 
an increase in production in the gulf of mexico of mmcf d related to favorable weather conditions as compared to hurricane related downtime experienced during also  runtime at independence hub increased during as compared to when export pipeline repair work resulted in downtime 
these increases in natural gas production were partially offset by a mmcf d decrease in the southern and appalachia region resulting from natural production declines experienced while drilling programs were shifted from established fields to emerging shale plays 
the average natural gas price anadarko received increased for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in demand 
anadarko s average natural gas price decreased substantially for the year ended december   primarily because of higher year over year us natural gas production and storage volumes coupled with lower united states demand for natural gas  triggered by the economic downturn in the united states

also  algerian crude oil sales volumes increased mbbls d primarily due to the timing of cargo liftings 
anadarko s daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes increased mbbls d for the year ended december   primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes of mbbls d in the gulf of mexico and mbbls d in the rockies 
the increase in the gulf of mexico results from additional production that came online during the fourth quarter of  and favorable weather conditions as compared to  which was impacted by export pipeline repair work and hurricane related disruptions 
the increase in the rockies relates to production efficiencies from an oil pipeline that was placed into service in mid these increases were offset by lower algerian crude oil sales volumes of mbbls d due to the timing of cargo liftings and variances in the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec quotas 
the average crude oil price anadarko received increased for the year ended december   as a result of increased global demand

inc dec vs 
gathering  processing and marketing sales gathering  processing and marketing expenses margin for the year ended december   gathering  processing and marketing margin increased million 
the increase was primarily due to higher margins associated with natural gas sales from inventory  an increase in processed ngls volumes and higher ngls prices  both of which increased margins under percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts  partially offset by the absence of gas processing margins associated with assets divested in for the year ended december   gathering  processing and marketing margin decreased million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower market prices for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which led to reduced gas processing margins  lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas  and unrealized losses on derivatives related to gas storage activity  which is seasonal in nature  in that the margin realized on the future sale of stored volumes covered by these derivative instruments is expected to more than offset the recorded unrealized losses 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in crude oil and ngls marketing margins  which were largely attributable to inventory write downs to market value that occurred in the fourth quarter of gains losses on divestitures and other  net gains on divestitures in were million and related primarily to the divestiture of onshore united states oil and gas properties

oil and gas operating oil and gas transportation and other exploration for the year ended december   oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily due to decreased workover costs of million in the gulf of mexico as a result of the moratorium and subsequent delays in obtaining permits 
for the year ended december   oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost savings programs initiated in response to the reduction in oil prices in and cost savings were achieved through operating efficiencies  deferral of certain workovers and vendor negotiations 
these cost savings were realized primarily through lower workover costs and surface maintenance costs of million and million  respectively 
additional reductions were due to lower production handling costs of million  primarily in the gulf of mexico due to repair related pipeline downtime 
in  the company expects to maintain efforts to manage costs more efficiently through its knowledge transfer initiatives and supply chain management negotiations  however  oil and gas operating expense per boe could increase 
additionally  the costs of doing business in the gulf of mexico could increase due to the permit timing delays and compliance with heightened boemre regulatory requirements 
for the year ended december   oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to higher gas gathering and transportation costs of million and million  primarily attributable to increased production in the rockies and the southern and appalachia region  respectively  and the expensing of million of idle drilling rig lease payments and million of rig termination fees incurred in related to deepwater drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico

operating results segment analysis adjusted ebitdax to assess the operating results of anadarko s segments  the chief operating decision maker analyzes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  dd a  impairments  and unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments  net  less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests adjusted ebitdax 
anadarko s definition of adjusted ebitdax  which is not a gaap measure  excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to anadarko s financing methods or capital structure 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes exploration expense  as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period 
however  exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  dd a and impairments are excluded from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
in addition  unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments  net are excluded from adjusted ebitdax since these unrealized gains losses are not considered to be a measure of asset operating performance 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders 
adjusted ebitdax  as defined by anadarko  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  anadarko s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with net income loss attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income loss attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of anadarko s results as reported under gaap

additional reserve information is contained in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities supplemental information under item of this form k 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year as required by the securities and exchange commission  reserves for and are computed using the month average beginning of month prices  and reserves for are computed using year end prices 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions purchases in place  discoveries and extensions and revisions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve growth to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore united states and the deep waters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the united states 
although shale plays only represent about of the company s total proved reserves  growth in the company s shale plays contributed mmboe of the total additions 
the company also acquired mmboe of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the united states and international locations 
the company also acquired mmboe of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling  and development and appraisal wells in the united states 

table of contents revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to successful infill drilling in large onshore natural gas plays  such as the greater natural buttes  wattenberg and pinedale fields where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as positive revisions  mmboe of revisions to prior estimates and mmboe associated with higher oil and gas prices 
these positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of mmboe of puds to unproved categories as a result of changes to development plans during total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to large onshore natural gas plays  such as the greater natural buttes and pinedale fields  as a result of successful infill drilling where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as positive revisions 
the revisions also include a decrease of mmboe caused by lower natural gas prices 
total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to greater natural buttes  wattenberg and pinedale fields  as a result of successful infill drilling  and positive revisions to the peregrino heavy oil field  offshore brazil  which was sold in  partially offset by a decrease of mmboe related to price impacts for oil and ngls

discounted future net cash flows at december   the discounted at estimated future net cash flows from anadarko s proved reserves was billion stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
these discounted future net cash flows were calculated based on the month average beginning of month prices for the year  held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
for reporting periods prior to december   year end prices were used for calculating discounted future net cash flows 
the increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to changes in prices and costs as well as revisions of previous quantity estimates 
see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair value of anadarko s proved reserves 
a fair value estimate would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
liquidity and capital resources overview anadarko generates its capital needed over the long term to fund capital expenditures  debt service obligations  and dividend payments primarily from cash flows from operating activities  and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain the desired capital structure and finance acquisition opportunities 
liquidity may also be enhanced through asset divestitures and joint ventures that reduce future capital expenditures 
consistent with this approach  during  cash flows from operating activities were the primary source for funding capital investment  while proceeds from issuing debt were used to refinance existing debt obligations 
the company continuously monitors its liquidity needs  coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule  and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of both current and expected future conditions 
during  the company further enhanced its liquidity in response to the potential exposure to future obligations related to the deepwater horizon events by refinancing billion of its and scheduled maturities with longer term debt and replacing its billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in with the billion facility maturing in  thereby significantly increasing the company s capacity for immediate access to capital 
entering into the billion facility  coupled with certain modifications to contracts governing the company s commodity derivative arrangements  also reduced the company s potential obligation to provide cash collateral  as discussed under effects of credit rating downgrade below 

table of contents at december   anadarko s and scheduled debt maturities were million and million  respectively  for a total of million including repayments of wes s senior unsecured revolving credit facility rcf and the company s capital lease obligations  or billion including the accreted value of zero coupon senior notes zero coupons that could be put to the company in  as discussed below 
the company has a variety of funding sources available  including cash on hand of billion at december   an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash flow generating capacity and opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint venture arrangements 
in addition  the company s billion facility remains undrawn at december   providing available capacity of billion billion undrawn capacity less million of outstanding letters of credit supported by the billion facility 
management believes that the company s liquidity position  asset portfolio  and continued strong operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund current operations and  based on information currently available  any potential future obligations related to the deepwater horizon events 
however  anadarko is currently unable to predict the ultimate impact of the deepwater horizon events on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note deepwater horizon events in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
revolving credit facility borrowings under the billion facility will bear interest  at the company s election  at i the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to  based on the company s credit rating  or ii the greatest of a the jpmorgan chase bank prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  or c one month libor plus  plus in each case  an applicable margin 
obligations incurred under the billion facility  as well as obligations anadarko may have to certain lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k  are guaranteed by certain of the company s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  and are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the united states and of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
the company incurred upfront underwriting  structuring  arrangement and other costs in connection with the billion facility 
these costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the five year credit commitment term 
the cost of capital to the company under the terms of the billion facility is greater than the cost of capital to the company under the billion revolving credit agreement previously in effect due to the increased size and term of the billion facility and then current market conditions 
for example  outstanding borrowings under the billion facility at december   would bear a libor based interest rate margin of as compared to a margin of provided for under the billion credit agreement previously in effect 
costs ultimately incurred under the billion facility will vary with the level of facility utilization  the ultimate borrowing terms and anadarko s corporate credit rating 
financial covenants the billion facility contains various customary covenants with which anadarko must comply  including  but not limited to  limitations on incurrence of indebtedness  liens on assets  and asset sales 
anadarko is also required to maintain  at the end of each quarter  i a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to relative to consolidated ebitdax for the most recent period of four calendar quarters  ii a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of no less than to  and iii a collateral coverage ratio of no less than to  in each case  as defined in the billion facility 
the collateral coverage ratio is the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the billion facility 
additionally  to borrow from the billion facility  the collateral coverage ratio must be no less than to after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing 
the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at december   and there were no restrictions on its ability to utilize the available capacity of the billion facility 
at december   the covenants contained in certain of the company s credit agreements provided for a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of 
the covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends  however  the impact of dividends paid on the company s debt to capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance 
at december   anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants 
zero coupon notes in a private offering  anadarko received million of loan proceeds upon issuing the zero coupons maturing october the zero coupons have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of billion  reflecting a yield to maturity of 
the holder has the right to cause the company to repay up to of the then accreted value of the zero coupons in october of each year starting in the accreted value of the zero coupons is million at december  and will be million at the next possible put date in october 
table of contents the company considers its cash flow generating capacity and access to additional liquidity sufficient to continue to satisfy the company s debt service and other obligations  including the potential early repayment of the zero coupons if the put option is exercised by the holder 
effects of credit rating downgrade as a consequence of uncertainties regarding the possible range of anadarko s potential obligations related to the deepwater horizon events  in june  moody s lowered the company s senior unsecured credit rating from baa to ba and placed the company s long term ratings under review for further possible downgrade the credit rating downgrade  while s p and fitch each affirmed their bbb rating with a negative outlook 
in september  moody s announced that it concluded its review and confirmed anadarko s ba credit rating and changed the rating outlook to stable 
as a result of the credit rating downgrade in june  the company s credit thresholds with its derivative counterparties were reduced and in many cases eliminated  which would ordinarily increase the possibility that counterparties could require additional collateral when the company s net derivative trading position is a liability 
however  because certain of the company s derivative counterparties are also lenders under the billion facility  and as such  receive security interests in specified assets of the company  derivative related agreements with most of these counterparties have been amended such that those counterparties require no additional collateral beyond that provided under the billion facility 
as a result  at december   the company had only million of cash collateral provided as security for its derivative contract related obligations compared to million at december   and expects such future cash requirements to be relatively insignificant 
the credit rating downgrade also increases the likelihood of anadarko being required to post collateral as financial assurance of its performance under other contractual arrangements  such as pipeline transportation contracts  oil and gas sales contracts and work commitments 
at december   million of letters of credit million of which were supported by the billion facility were provided as assurance of the company s performance under various contractual arrangements and commitments  compared to million at december  wes funding sources anadarko s consolidated subsidiary  wes  primarily uses cash to fund its ongoing operations  make acquisitions and other capital investments  service its debt  and make distributions to equity holders 
wes relies primarily on cash generated from its operating activities for funding  as well as debt or equity issuances  supplemented as needed with borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
wes has committed borrowing capacity of million under its rcf that extends through october the rcf is not guaranteed by anadarko or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
outstanding borrowings under the rcf  which bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to for a rate of at december   were million at december   with million remaining borrowing capacity 
the credit rating downgrade of anadarko did not affect the availability of credit or the cost of borrowing under the wes rcf 
insurance coverage and other indemnities anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the company s properties  blowout control of well  restoration and redrill  sudden and accidental pollution  third party liability  workers compensation and employers liability  and other risks 
the below stated insurance limits for blowout control of well and for third party liabilities are reduced proportionally to anadarko s participating interest in a venture 
some of the below stated limits are aggregate amounts  but most policies allow for reinstatement 
anadarko s insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery 
additionally  the company s insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences and damages 
anadarko s property and casualty insurance policies renew in june of each year  with the next renewals scheduled for june in light of the deepwater horizon events  the company may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs  if at all 
future insurance coverage for the oil and gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions 
in addition  some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that the company considers economically acceptable 
refer to note deepwater horizon events insurance recoveries in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for discussion of the company s insurance coverage applicable to the deepwater horizon events 

table of contents the company s current insurance coverage  which was obtained subsequent to the deepwater horizon events  includes physical damage to anadarko s properties on a replacement cost basis  million in limit for loss of production income for the independence hub facility  million for an offshore blowout control of a well  restoration and redrill  and pollution from an offshore blowout million for onshore  million aircraft liability  and million in limit for third party liabilities 
the company s total limit is approximately billion which is reduced proportionally to the company s participating interest in a venture for the negative environmental impacts of an offshore blowout 
if caused by a named windstorm  there is currently no coverage for physical damage to the company s properties  loss of production income for the independence hub facility  blowout control of a well  or restoration and redrill 
the company s service agreements  including drilling contracts  generally indemnify anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors 
also  these service agreements generally indemnify anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider 
following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three year period ended december  forward looking information related to the company s liquidity and capital resources is discussed in outlook that follows 
sources of cash operating activities anadarko s cash flow from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to higher commodity prices  higher sales volumes and the impact of changes in working capital items 
the decrease in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to lower commodity prices  partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized gains on interest rate derivatives that resulted from the company s election to revise the contractual terms of its interest rate swap portfolio which resulted in the realization of million in cash 
fluctuations in commodity prices are one of the primary sources of variability in the company s cash flows from operating activities  which anadarko manages by entering into commodity derivative instruments 
sales volume changes also impact cash flow  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices 
anadarko s long term cash flows from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  sales volumes  the amount of costs and expenses required for continued operations and debt service  as well as any potential obligation to fund deepwater horizon event related liabilities 
refer to note deepwater horizon events in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for discussion and analysis of these events 
investing activities during  and  anadarko received proceeds of million  million and billion before income taxes  respectively  related to several property divestiture transactions 
proceeds received in relate to the divestiture and portfolio rationalization activity initiated following anadarko s corporate acquisitions completed in august in connection with the retirement of the midstream subsidiary note and the associated liquidation of trinity associates llc trinity in  anadarko received million in cash representing the return of the company s original investment in trinity

see uses of cash for further information about debt repayments 
as discussed in revolving credit facility above  anadarko entered into the billion facility in in connection with the billion facility  the company incurred upfront underwriting  structuring  arrangement and other costs totaling million 
no borrowings were made under the billion facility upon closing and through the date of filing this form k 

table of contents during  anadarko s consolidated subsidiary  wes  borrowed a total of million under a three year senior unsecured term loan the term loan and rcf primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from anadarko 
during  wes issued approximately million common units in two public offerings  realizing net proceeds of million  which were used to repay a portion of outstanding rcf borrowings 
during  anadarko raised billion in connection with the public offering of senior notes and an additional billion in connection with the public offering of million shares of common stock

capital expenditures the following table presents the company s capital expenditures by category 
millions property acquisitions exploration development exploration development total oil and gas costs incurred less corporate acquisitions and non cash property exchanges less asset retirement costs less geological and geophysical  exploration overhead  delay rentals expenses and other expenses less amortization of acquired drilling rig contract intangibles total oil and gas capital expenditures gathering  processing and marketing and other total capital expenditures oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves 
capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions  property exchanges and asset retirement costs 
capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis 
additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statements of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash basis presentation 
anadarko s capital spending increased for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in exploration lease acquisitions onshore and offshore united states  higher development drilling onshore and increased expenditures related to construction in algeria 
during  the company reallocated of its total budgeted capital expenditures from the gulf of mexico and redirected onshore united states capital expenditures to focus on liquids rich areas onshore united states 
the company spent approximately million less than the original budgeted capital expenditures 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into a joint venture agreement that requires a third party joint venture partner to fund up to billion of anadarko s share of future acquisition  drilling  completion  equipment and other capital expenditures to earn a interest in anadarko s marcellus shale assets  primarily located in north central pennsylvania 
at december   million of the total billion obligation had been funded 

table of contents anadarko s capital expenditures decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to declines in development drilling expenditures onshore united states and expenditures on gathering and processing facilities 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in development drilling expenditures in ghana  exploration drilling expenditures onshore united states  property acquisition costs and capital expenditures related to the company s acquisition of office buildings in the woodlands  texas 
property acquisitions in primarily related to exploratory non producing leases onshore united states and proved property acquisitions related to property exchanges in the rockies

common stock repurchase program in august  the company initiated a billion share repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the program is authorized to extend through august the program does not obligate anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time 
during  anadarko purchased million shares of common stock for million under the program through purchases in the open market and under share repurchase agreements 
no shares were repurchased under the program in or common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling wes interest owners in  and  anadarko paid million  million and million  respectively  in dividends to its common stockholders nine cents per share per quarter 
anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming an independent public company in the amount of future dividends for anadarko common stock will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements  the effect a dividend payment would have on the company s compliance with relevant financial covenants contained in its debt agreements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
anadarko s consolidated subsidiary  wes  distributed to its unitholders other than anadarko an aggregate of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
wes has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering in the second quarter of and has increased its distribution from per common unit for the fourth quarter of to per common unit for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents outlook the company remains committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration  appraisal and development programs 
the company plans to allocate approximately of its capital spending to development activities  to exploration activities and to gas gathering and processing activities and other business activities 
the company expects its capital spending by area to be approximately for the united states onshore region and alaska  for the gulf of mexico  for international and for midstream and other 
anadarko believes that its expected level of operating cash flows and cash on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund the company s projected operational and capital programs for  while continuing to meet its other obligations 
however  if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flows and cash on hand  additional funding would likely be supplemented as needed through short term borrowings under the billion facility  which remains undrawn at december  and provides available capacity of billion billion undrawn capacity less million of outstanding letters of credit supported by the billion facility  as well as asset divestitures and joint venture arrangements 
the company continuously monitors its liquidity needs  coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule  and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of both current and expected future conditions 
in order to increase the predictability of cash flows  anadarko has entered into strategic derivative positions  which  at december   cover approximately and of its anticipated natural gas sales volumes and oil and condensate sales volumes  respectively  for in addition  the company has commodity derivative positions in place for see note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the company s primary emphasis is on managing near term growth opportunities with a commitment to worldwide exploration and the continued development of large oil projects in algeria  offshore ghana and in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
in response to the deepwater horizon events  the federal government may issue further safety and environmental laws or regulations regarding operations in the gulf of mexico  in addition to the regulations promulgated by the boemre during  which are described in greater detail in the risk factors under item a of this form k 
these additional laws and regulations  delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill response plans as well as possible additional actions could affect the timing of new drilling and ongoing development efforts  result in increased costs  and limit activities in certain areas of the gulf of mexico 
off balance sheet arrangements anadarko may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations 
at december   the company s material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit 
there are no other transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect anadarko s liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources

table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
management reviews its estimates and related assumptions regularly  including those related to the value of properties and equipment  proved reserves  goodwill  intangible assets  asset retirement obligations  litigation reserves  environmental liabilities  pension assets and liabilities and costs  income taxes and fair values 
changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the company s audit committee 
oil and gas activities anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities 
under this method  acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves 
geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
acquisition costs acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities 
significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment  based on the company s current exploration plans  and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated 
for unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs  costs are amortized on a group basis thereby establishing a valuation allowance over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment 
costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance  while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties  as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases  are included in exploration expense 
significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play for example  the greater natural buttes area in the rockies  while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area 
a majority of the company s unproved property costs are associated with properties acquired in the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions in and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed 
generally  economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests  but may be confirmed by the company s continuing exploration and development programs 
another portion of the company s unproved property costs are associated with the land grant acreage  where the company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage 
a change in the company s expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the company s unproved property 
exploratory costs under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized  or suspended  pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling 
at the end of each quarter  management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities  which includes  for example  analyzing whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or  in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning  analyzing whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned 
if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur  associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period 
therefore  at any point in time  the company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period 

table of contents proved reserves in december  anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements that conform the definition of proved reserves to the sec modernization of oil and gas reporting rules  which were issued by the sec at the end of these rules require that the average  first day of the month price during the month period preceding the end of the year  rather than the year end price  be used when estimating reserve quantities and permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
prior year data are presented in accordance with fasb oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods  however  historical information has been reclassified to conform to the significant geographic areas required to be disclosed under the revised rules 
anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the sec and the fasb 
this definition includes crude oil  natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods  government regulations  etc  ie  at prices as described above and costs as of the date the estimates are made 
prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements  and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data  as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier 
a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd a and could result in the recognition of an impairment 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  third party legal counsel or consultants are utilized 

table of contents fair value the company estimates fair value for derivatives  long lived assets for impairment testing  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  assets and liabilities exchanged in non monetary transactions  guarantees  pension plan assets  initial measurements of aros  assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination and financial instruments that require fair value disclosure  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
when the company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  the company generally utilizes an income valuation approach 
this approach is based upon management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the company s estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in the company s business plans and investment decisions 
goodwill at december   the company had billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at october  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
the first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units oil and gas exploration and production  gathering and processing  and transportation 
at december   these reporting units have goodwill balances of billion  million and million respectively 
during the second quarter of  a decline in the fair value of anadarko s oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit was indicated as a result of the deepwater horizon events and general uncertainty arising in connection with the moratorium and uncertain regulatory impacts 
see note deepwater horizon events and note contingencies deepwater drilling moratorium and other related matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the company completed an interim goodwill impairment test of the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit at june   and the results of the test indicated no impairment 
in addition  the company completed its october   annual goodwill impairment tests with no goodwill impairment indicated 
although anadarko cannot predict whether goodwill will be impaired in the future  and impairment charges may occur if the company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
also  uncertainty related to the deepwater horizon events  difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events could trigger additional goodwill impairment tests in the near term  the results of which may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
because quoted market prices for the company s reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests 
management uses all available information to make these fair value estimates  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit  and market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
in estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit  the company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the company s supplemental oil and gas disclosures  market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date adjusted for location and quality differentials  capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates  and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in anadarko s operations 
for the company s gathering and processing and transportation reporting units  the company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected ebitda 
the company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the company s projected ebitda for these reporting units 

table of contents a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in goodwill impairments 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on the company s most recent goodwill impairment tests  it was concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated 
impairment of assets a long lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows 
impairment  if any  is measured as the excess of an asset s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
the company utilizes an income approach when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist 
this fair value approach requires use of management s best estimates  including asset production profiles and cost expectations  combined with inputs a market participant would use  eg  prices and discount rates 
derivative instruments all derivative instruments  other than those that satisfy specific exceptions  are recorded at fair value 
if market quotes are not available to estimate fair value  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry standard valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments 
option fair values are measured using the black scholes option pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options 
unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded to anadarko s current earnings 
benefit plan obligations the company has non contributory us defined benefit pension plans  including both qualified and supplemental plans  and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
determination of the benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations  the expected long term rates of return on plan assets  the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees and the future level of health care costs 
discount rate the discount rate assumption used by the company represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
the company currently uses a yield curve analysis to support the discount rate assumption for the plans 
this analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high quality  non callable  marketable bonds  and discounting the estimated cash flows associated with benefits to be provided under each plan using interest rates on the curve that correspond to the expected timing of payment 
the present value of future plan benefits determined in this manner is then used to estimate a single plan specific discount rate that equates such present value with the corresponding future undiscounted cash flows 
application of this method resulted in a weighted average discount rate assumption weighted by the plan level benefit obligation at december   of for pension plans and for other postretirement plans 

table of contents expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by asset class and expected long term asset allocation 
the expected return for each asset class reflects capital market projections formulated using a forward looking building block approach  while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions 
equity returns generally reflect long term expectations of real earnings growth  dividend yield  and inflation 
returns on fixed income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation  real bond yield  and risk spread as appropriate  adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate return 
other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets 
because the assumption reflects the company s expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon  generally  it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year  even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often experience significant volatility 
to measure the net periodic pension cost for its funded pension plans for the year ended december   anadarko assumed an average long term rate of return of 
a variation in this assumption of basis points would have changed the measure of net periodic pension cost by million  with higher investment return assumption resulting in lower recognized expense 
rate of compensation increases the company s assumption is based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry 
the benefit obligations at december  and reflect the weighted average assumed rate of increase in long term compensation levels of annually 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and beyond 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  establishes accruals for such amounts 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities  including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities  are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although management considers its tax accruals adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate risk exists due to anticipated payments and receipts denominated in foreign currencies 
these risks can affect revenues and cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s risk management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments utilized by the company include futures  swaps  options and fixed price physical delivery contracts 
the volume of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the company is governed by risk management policies and may vary from year to year 
both exchange and over the counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements  and the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements

energy price risk the company s most significant market risk relates to prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
as energy prices decline or rise significantly  revenues and cash flow significantly decline or rise 
in addition  a non cash write down of the company s oil and gas properties or goodwill may be required if future oil and gas commodity prices experience a sustained  significant decline 
below is a sensitivity analysis of the company s commodity price related derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future equity production of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil at december  at december   the company had a net derivative asset position of million on these derivative instruments 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these derivatives by million  while a decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by million 
however  any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase  respectively  in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes at december   the company had a net derivative asset position of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would not materially impact the company s loss or gain on these derivative instruments

interest rate risk at december   million of wes borrowings under its rcf and term loan  which are included in anadarko s reported debt balance  were subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining reported balance of anadarko s long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheets was at fixed interest rates 
the company s billion of libor based obligations  which are presented net of preferred investments in two non controlled entities on the company s consolidated balance sheets  give rise to minimal net interest rate risk exposure because coupons on the related preferred investments are also libor based 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
a increase in libor would not materially impact the company s interest cost 

table of contents increases in market rates of interest will unfavorably impact the interest cost of future debt issuances 
to mitigate this risk  in december and january  anadarko entered into interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of up to billion  whereby the company locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three month libor 
since the swaps were initiated  the company refinanced a portion of its and debt maturities 
the company has million of remaining scheduled debt maturities for and  which include payments on the company s capital lease obligations and repayments of wes s rcf  or billion including the zero coupons  which could be put to the company in the company may settle some or all of its interest rate swap positions in connection with future debt issuances  if any  and will settle any remaining positions when the interest rate swaps are scheduled to terminate in and at december   the company had a net derivative liability position of million related to interest rate swaps  million of which is associated with instruments settling in october a increase or decrease in the three month libor interest rate curve would increase or decrease  respectively  the aggregate fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps agreements by approximately million

foreign currency exchange rate risk anadarko s operating revenues are realized in us dollars  and the predominant portion of anadarko s capital and operating expenditures are us dollar denominated 
exposure to foreign currency risk generally arises in connection with project specific contractual arrangements and other commitments 
at december   near term foreign currency denominated expenditures are expected to be primarily in euros  brazilian reais and british pounds sterling 
management mitigates a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  as discussed below 
with respect to its international oil and gas development projects  anadarko is a party to contracts containing commitments extending through january that are impacted by euro to us dollar exchange rates 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased approximately million us dollar equivalent of euros in order to manage euro exchange rate risk relative to the us dollar for euro denominated expenditures 
at december   euro denominated cash of approximately million  or million in us dollar equivalent  is included in cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  anadarko entered into euro us dollar collars  which are effective during  for an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the combination of euro purchases already executed and financial collars in effect during substantially mitigates anadarko s exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate inherent in its existing capital expenditure commitments 
the company also has risk related to exchange rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the company s brazilian tax liability attributable to its divestiture of the peregrino field offshore brazil 
a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate would not materially impact the company s gain or loss related to foreign currency
