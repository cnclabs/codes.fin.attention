the new business also included the gmt program  which is the mid size truck suv platform that previously did not offer auto dimming mirrors 
the gm programs were transferred to the company by the model year 
during  the company negotiated another extension to the existing agreement  through august   in the ordinary course of the company s business 
the existing agreements with the company were not impacted by their chapter bankruptcy in in response to the weakness in the automotive market in  the company eliminated its entire contract workforce  which was followed by the elimination of a third shift near the end of the third quarter of in addition  the company offered voluntary layoffs  had a partial plant shutdown the week of the thanksgiving holiday and had extended plant shutdowns over the christmas and new year holidays in response to similar plant shutdowns by its automotive customers 
as automotive production schedules continued to weaken at that time  the company permanently laid off approximately hourly and salaried workers in december  which reduced overhead and operating expenses  bringing them to a level that was more in line with sales production levels in the automotive and fire protection industries 
the salaried workforce reductions reduced overhead and operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis 
approximately half of the reduced expense impacts the company s overhead expenses  and the other half impacts the company s operating expenses  primarily in the engineering  research and development areas 
the company also instituted rolling layoffs within the hourly production workforce throughout the first quarter of as the automotive production environment improved during the second half of  the company started adding temporary contract workers  some direct hire hourly workers and resumed third shift production in certain areas during the third quarter of as the automotive production environment and global economic conditions continued to improve throughout  the company continued to add temporary contract workers  direct hire hourly workers and technical salaried positions to meet increased demand for its products 
in addition  the company has utilized overtime and third shift production to meet increased production schedules 
during the second half of  the company experienced increased costs associated with supply chain constraints on certain automotive grade electronic components 
the company currently expects these supply chain constraints to persist into the first half of calendar year however  the supply chain related issues the company has experienced to date have not disrupted deliveries to customers 
the company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of ihs csm worldwide  and ihs csm s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the first quarter of are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
current forecasts for light vehicle production for the first six months of are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 

table of contents the company currently estimates that top line revenue will increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in based on the current ihs csm forecast for light vehicle production levels and our anticipated product mix 
these estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the regions to which the company ships product  as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix 
uncertainties  including light vehicle production levels  extended automotive plant shutdowns  sales rates in north america  europe and asia  customer inventory management  and the impact of potential automotive customer including their tier suppliers bankruptcies  work stoppages  strikes  supplier part shortages  etc  which could disrupt shipments to these customers making forecasting difficult 
due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes  it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast  and as a result  the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of at this time 
the company also estimates that engineering  research and development expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to additional hiring of employee and outside contract engineering development services 
in addition  the company estimates that selling  general and administrative expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to increased overseas office expenses 
based on the current ihs csm forecast for light vehicle production levels for the entire year  the company currently estimates that smartbeam unit shipments will increase approximately in calendar year compared with calendar year the company currently believes that there are too many uncertainties to provide annual guidance for rcd mirror unit shipments at this time due to the december  nhtsa announcement pertaining to the kids transportation safety act of refer to the auto dimming rearview mirrors section in part i  item for additional details 
many automakers are now revisiting decisions that may have been made prior to the december  announcement causing additional uncertainty 
as a result  based on the current ihs csm forecast for light vehicle production levels  we currently estimate that rcd mirror unit shipments will increase approximately for the first six months of compared with the same period in the company is not providing any other estimates at this time

see the contractual obligations and other commitments below 
market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including foreign exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company has some assets  liabilities and operations outside the united states  including a euro denominated account  which currently are not significant 
because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
most of the company s non us sales are invoiced and paid in non us dollars  during  approximately of the company s net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies compared to for and for 
the company currently expects that approximately of the company s net sales in will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies 
the reduction in foreign currency denominated sales in was the result of a major customer in europe switching certain programs back from euro denominated sales to us dollars 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities

the increase in purchase obligations as of december   compared to december  is primarily due to the significant increase in automotive production levels and supply chain constraints for certain inventory parts  which resulted in extended lead times 
critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns  which have not historically been significant 
the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables 

table of contents accounts receivable 
the company reviews a monthly aging report of all accounts receivable balances starting with invoices outstanding over sixty days 
in addition  the company monitors information about its customers through a variety of sources including the media  and information obtained through on going interaction between company personnel and the customer 
based on the evaluation of the above information  the company estimates its allowances related to customer receivables on historical credit and collections experience  customers current financial condition and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the allowances  but such adjustments have not  historically  been material 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
investments 
the company s internal investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
management also considers the type of security  related industry  sector performance  as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may incur future impairments 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes 
the company applies the provisions of asc as it relates to uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements 
a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination is applied to uncertain tax positions 
the company deems the estimates related to this provision to be reasonable  however  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not vary from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc the company utilizes the black scholes model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating a the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  b the volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  c the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and d expected dividends 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations
