item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general the us economy experienced a recession beginning around the fourth quarter of  which was caused by the global credit crisis and declining gdp  employment  business investment  corporate profits and consumer spending 
as a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy  lodging demand in the us declined significantly throughout and however  beginning in  the lodging industry has been experiencing improvement in fundamentals  specifically occupancy 
room rates  measured by the average daily rate  or adr  which typically lags occupancy growth in the early stage of a recovery  appear to be showing upward growth 
we believe recent improvements in the economy will continue to positively affect the lodging industry and hotel operating results for our overall current strategy is to take advantage of the cyclical nature of the hotel industry 
we believe that in the current cycle  hotel values and cash flows  for the most part  peaked in  and we believe we will not achieve similar cash flows and values in the immediate future 
industry experts have suggested that cash flows within our industry may achieve these previous highs again through in response to the challenging market conditions  we undertook a series of actions to manage the sources and uses of our funds in an effort to navigate through challenging market conditions while still pursuing opportunities that can create long term shareholder value 
in this effort  we have attempted to proactively address value and cash flow deficits among certain of our mortgaged hotels  with a goal of enhancing shareholder value through loan amendments or in certain instances  consensual transfers of hotel properties to the lenders in satisfaction of the related debt 
as of december   we owned hotel properties directly and six hotel properties through majority owned investments in joint ventures  which represented  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to joint venture partners 
our hotels are primarily operated under the widely recognized upper upscale brands of crown plaza  hilton  hyatt  marriott and sheraton 
all these hotels are located in the united states 
at december   of the hotels are included in our continuing operations 
as of december   we also owned mezzanine or first mortgage loans receivable with a carrying value of million 
in addition  at december   we had ownership interests in two joint ventures that own mezzanine loans with a carrying value of million  net of valuation allowance 
based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our current key priorities and financial strategies include  among other things acquisition of hotel properties  disposition of hotel properties  restructuring and liquidating positions in mezzanine loans  pursuing capital market activities to enhance long term shareholder value  enhancing liquidity  and continuing current cost saving measures  implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability  implementing asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms  utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks  and making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate 
our long term investment strategies continue to focus on the upscale and upper upscale segments within the lodging industry 
we believe that as supply  demand  and capital market cycles change  we will be able to shift our investment strategies to take advantage of new lodging related investment opportunities as they may develop 
our board of directors may change our investment strategies at any time without shareholder approval or notice 

table of contents significant transactions in and recent developments resumption of common dividends in february  the board of directors accepted management s recommendation to resume paying a cash dividend on our common shares with an annualized target of for the payment of for the first quarter of has been approved and subsequent payments will be reviewed on a quarterly basis 
reissuance of treasury stock in december  we reissued million shares of our treasury stock at a gross price of per share and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility

pending and completed sales of hotel properties we have entered into asset sale agreements for the sale of the jw marriott hotel property in san francisco  california  the hilton hotel property in rye town  new york  and the hampton inn hotel property in houston  texas 
based on the selling price  we recorded an impairment charge of million on the hilton rye town property in the fourth quarter of  and we expect each of these sales to close in the first quarter of these hotel properties and related liabilities have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and their operating results  including the impairment charge  for all periods presented have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in february  the sale of the jw marriott hotel property was completed and we received net cash proceeds of million 
we used million of the net proceeds to reduce the borrowings on our senior credit facility 
after the payment  the credit facility has an outstanding balance of million 
in june  we entered into an agreement to sell the hilton suites in auburn hills  michigan for million  and the sale was completed in september based on the sales price  we recorded an impairment charge of million in june  and an additional loss of  at closing based on the net proceeds of million 
the operating results of the hotel property  including the related impairment charge and the additional loss  for all periods presented have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
see note impairment of mezzanine loans and a hotel property we evaluated the collectability of the mezzanine loan secured by hotel properties maturing in april at december   and weighted different probabilities of outcome from full payment at maturity to a foreclosure by the senior lender 
based on this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million on december  the borrowers of the mezzanine loan tranches and held in our joint venture with prei related to the jer highland hospitality portfolio stopped making debt service payments in august and we are currently negotiating a restructuring with their equity holders  senior secured lenders and senior mezzanine lenders 
due to our junior participation status  it is expected the tranche mezzanine loan will be completely extinguished in the restructuring 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million for the entire carrying value of our investment in the joint venture on december  we did not record a valuation allowance for the tranche mezzanine loan as the restructuring could result in a conversion of the mezzanine loan into equity with us investing an additional amount 
at december   the hilton hotel property in tucson  arizona had a reasonable probability of being sold in the near future 
based on our assessment of the expected purchase price obtained from potential buyers  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
refinancing of mortgage debt in october  we closed on a million refinancing of the marriott gateway in arlington  virginia 
the new loan  which has a year term and fixed interest rate of  replaces a million loan set to mature in with an interest rate of libor plus 
the excess proceeds were used to reduce million of the outstanding borrowings on our senior credit facility 
in conjunction with the refinance  we incurred prepayment penalties and fees of million and wrote off the unamortized loan costs on the refinanced debt of  
table of contents conversion of floating interest rate swap into fixed rate in october  we converted our billion interest rate swap into a fixed rate of  resulting in locked in annual interest savings of approximately million through march at no cost to us 
under the previous swap  which we entered into in march and which expires in march  we received a fixed rate of and paid a variable rate of libor plus  subject to a libor floor of 
under the terms of the new swap transaction  we will continue to receive a fixed rate of  but will pay a fixed rate of 
conversion of series b preferred stock in the fourth quarter of   shares of our series b preferred stock with a carrying value of million were converted to common shares  pursuant to the terms of the series b preferred stock 
preferred stock offering in september  we completed the offering of million shares of our series d cumulative preferred stock at a gross price of per share  and received net proceeds of million after underwriting fees and other costs and an accrued dividend of million 
the proceeds from the offering  together with some corporate funds  were used to pay down million of our senior credit facility 
restructuring of mezzanine loans in july  as a strategic complement to our existing joint venture with prudential real estate investors prei in  we contributed million for an ownership interest in a new joint venture with prei 
the new joint venture acquired a tranche mezzanine loan associated with jer partner s privatization of the jer highland hospitality portfolio 
the mezzanine loan is secured by the same hotel properties as our existing joint venture investment in tranche of the mezzanine loan portfolio  which has been fully reserved at december  the borrower of these mezzanine loans stopped making debt service payments in august we are currently pursuing our remedies under the loan documents  as well as negotiating with the borrowers  their equity holders  senior secured lenders and senior mezzanine lenders and prei with respect to a possible restructuring of the mezzanine tranches owned by our joint ventures and prei and of the indebtedness senior to such tranches 
as we hold our jer highland hospitality loans in joint ventures  our participation in a possible restructuring  including a conversion of the loans into equity and assumption of senior indebtedness associated with the portfolio  would be through a joint venture with prei or prei and a third party 
settlement of notes receivable in august  we reached an agreement with the borrower of the million junior participation note receivable secured by a hotel property in la jolla  california  to settle the loan which had been in default since march pursuant to the settlement agreement  we received total cash payments of million in and recorded a net impairment charge of  in may  the senior mortgage lender foreclosed on the loan secured by the four seasons hotel property in nevis in which we had a junior participation interest of million 
our entire principal amount was fully reserved in as a result of the foreclosure  our interest in the senior mortgage was converted to a subordinate beneficial interest in the equity of the trust that holds the hotel property 
due to our junior status in the trust  we have not recorded any value for our beneficial interest as of december  in may  the mezzanine loan secured by the le meridien hotel property in dallas  texas was settled with a cash payment of million 
the loan was fully reserved during the second quarter of as the borrower ceased making debt service payments on the loan 
as a result of the settlement  the million was recorded as a credit to impairment charges in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for impaired loans 
in february  the mezzanine loan secured by the ritz carlton hotel property in key biscayne  florida  with a principal amount of million and a net carrying value of million at december  was restructured 
in connection with the restructuring  we received a cash payment of million and a million note receivable 
we recorded a net impairment charge of million in on the original mezzanine loan 
the interest payments on the new note are recorded as a reduction of the principal of the note receivable  and the valuation adjustments to the net carrying amount of this note are recorded as a credit to impairment charges 
in february  we and the senior note holder of the participation note receivable formed a joint venture the redus jv for the purposes of holding  managing or disposing of the sheraton hotel property in dallas  texas  which collateralized the senior note participation and our million junior participating note receivable 
the note receivable was fully reserved in we have an subordinated interest in redus jv 
in march  the 
table of contents foreclosure was completed and the estimated fair value of the property was million based on a third party appraisal 
pursuant to the operating agreement of redus jv  as a junior lien holder of the original participation note receivable  we are only entitled to receive our share of distributions after the original senior note holder has recovered its original investment of million and redus jv intends to sell the hotel property in the next months 
it is unlikely that the senior holder will be able to recover its original investment 
therefore  no cash flows were projected from redus jv for the projected holding period 
under the applicable authoritative accounting guidance  we recorded a zero value for our subordinated interest in redus jv 
debt modifications  repayments and settlement the million non recourse mortgage loan secured by the westin o hare hotel property in rosemont  illinois was settled in september through a consensual transfer of the underlying hotel property to the lender 
we recorded a gain of million on the consensual transfer 
an impairment charge of million was previously recorded on this property in as we wrote down the hotel property to its estimated fair value 
the operating results of the hotel property  including the gain from the disposition  have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
with proceeds from the above mentioned equity offerings  sale of hotel properties and debt refinancing we made a net paydown of million on our senior credit facility during to reduce its outstanding balance to million at december  in july  we modified the mortgage loan secured by the jw marriott hotel property in san francisco  california  to change the initial maturity date to its fully extended maturity of march in exchange for a principal payment of million 
this hotel property was subsequently sold in february and the related mortgage loan was repaid at closing along with miscellaneous fees of approximately effective april   we completed the modification of the million mortgage loan secured by two hotel properties in washington dc and la jolla  california 
pursuant to the modified loan agreement  we obtained the full extension of the loan to august without any extension tests in exchange for a million paydown 
we paid million of the paydown amount at closing  and the remaining million is payable quarterly in four consecutive installments of  each with the last installment due on april  we paid a modification fee of million in lieu of the future extension fees 
the modification also modifies covenant tests to minimize the likelihood of additional cash being trapped 
in march  we elected to cease making payments on the million mortgage note payable maturing in january  secured by a hotel property in manchester  connecticut  because the anticipated operating cash flows from the underlying hotel property had been insufficient to cover the principal and interest payments on the note 
as of the date of this report  the loan has been transferred to a special servicer 
we are currently working with the special servicer for an extension or restructuring of the mortgage note 
repurchases of common shares and units of operating partnership during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total cost of million pursuant to a previously announced stock repurchase plan 
as of june  we ceased all repurchases under the plan indefinitely 
during   operating partnership units were redeemed at an average price of per unit 
we redeemed these operating partnership units for cash rather than electing to satisfy the redemption request through the issuance of common shares and paid a total redemption cost of million to the unit holders during additional  operating partnership units presented for redemption in were converted to common shares at our election 
liquidity and capital resources our cash position from operations is affected primarily by macro industry movements in occupancy and rate as well as our ability to control costs 
further  interest rates greatly affect the cost of our debt service as well as the financial hedges we put in place 
we monitor very closely the industry fundamentals as well as interest rates 
the strategy is that if the economy underperforms negatively affecting industry fundamentals  some or all of the loss in cash flow should be offset by our financial hedges due to  what we believe to be  the expectation that the federal reserve will probably keep interest rates low 
alternatively  if the federal reserve raises interest rates because of inflation  our properties should benefit from the ability to rapidly raise room rates in an inflationary environment 
capital expenditures above our reserves will affect cash flow as well 

table of contents in september  we entered into an at the market atm program with an investment banking firm to offer for sale from time to time up to million of our common stock at market prices 
no shares were sold during proceeds from the atm program  to the extent utilized  are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including investments and reduction of debt 
in february  we entered into a standby equity distribution agreement the seda with ya global master spv ltd 
ya global that terminates in  and is available to provide us additional liquidity if needed 
pursuant to the seda  ya global has agreed to purchase up to million which may be increased to million pursuant to the seda of newly issued shares of our common stock if notified to do so by us in accordance with the seda 
our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include positive cash flow from operations  capital market activities  property refinancing proceeds  asset sales  and net cash derived from interest rate derivatives 
additionally  our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls  owner funded capital expenditures  new investments and debt interest and principal payments 
items that impacted our cash flow and liquidity during the periods indicated are summarized as follows net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities  pursuant to our consolidated statement of cash flows which includes the changes in balance sheet items  were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to improved occupancies experienced during that resulted in increased hotel revenues 
the increase in operating cash flows is partially offset by an increase in interest payments on indebtedness of million as a result of certain mortgage loans that were refinanced at higher interest rates

in  investing activities used million of cash 
capital improvements made to various hotel properties used million and a cash balance of million was eliminated as a result of the deconsolidation of the hyatt regency hotel property

these cash outlays were partially offset by million from debt refinancing and million in cash payments from the counterparties of the interest rate derivatives 

table of contents we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under various debt  preferred equity and derivative agreements 
if we violate covenants in any debt or derivative agreement  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of certain debt covenants may result in us being unable to borrow unused amounts under a line of credit  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
in any event  financial covenants under our current or future debt obligations could impair our planned business strategies by limiting our ability to borrow i beyond certain amounts or ii for certain purposes 
presently  our existing financial debt covenants primarily relate to maintaining minimum debt coverage ratios  maintaining an overall minimum net worth  maintaining a maximum loan to value ratio  and maintaining an overall minimum total assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our debt  preferred equity and derivative agreements as amended 
virtually  our only recourse obligation is our million senior credit facility held by banks  which expires in april we have given notice to exercise the remaining one year extension option 
the outstanding balance on this credit facility at december  was million 
the main covenants in this senior credit facility include i the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of x through march  ours was x at december   and x thereafter until expiration  and ii the maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of ours was at december  
the primary requirements to extend the credit facility are that i there must be no default or event of default  ii the representations and warranties must be true and correct in all material respects and iii we pay each lender a fee equal to of such lender s commitment whether or not utilized 
we may be able to extend or refinance a portion or all of this senior credit facility before maturity  and if it becomes necessary to pay down the principal balance  we believe we will be able to accomplish that with cash on hand  cash flows from operations  equity raises or  to the extent necessary  asset sales 
the articles governing our series b preferred stock require us to maintain certain covenants 
the impairment charges recorded during the second  third and fourth quarter of  and the second and fourth quarter of could have prevented us from satisfying one financial ratio 
however  the holder of the series b preferred stock reviewed the specific impairment charges and agreed to exclude the impairment charges incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of  and the second and fourth quarters of  as they impacted the financial ratio calculations for the affected periods 
at december   we are in compliance with all covenants required under the articles governing the series b preferred stock 
based upon the current level of operations  management believes that our cash flow from operations along with our cash balances and the amount available under our senior credit facility million at december  will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
with respect to upcoming maturities  we will continue to proactively address our upcoming maturities 
no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue debt financing on individual properties and our debt investments 
we are committed to an investment strategy where we will opportunistically pursue hotel related investments as suitable situations arise 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from future borrowings under a credit facility or other loans  or from proceeds from additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities  asset sales  joint ventures and repayments of our loan investments 
however  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
we are encouraged by the incremental improvement in both the capital and debt markets over the last quarter and will continue to look at capital raising options 
our existing hotels are mostly located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
dividend policy 
effective with the fourth quarter ended december   and in conjunction with the amendment to our senior credit facility  the board of directors suspended the common stock dividend for in 
table of contents december  the board of directors determined  subject to ongoing review  to continue the suspension of the common dividend in  except to the extent required to maintain our reit status 
in february  the board of directors accepted management s recommendation to resume paying cash dividends on our common shares with an annualized target of per share for the payment of for the first quarter of has been approved and subsequent payments will be reviewed on a quarterly basis 
we may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions 
or  we may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing reit distribution requirements 
results of operations marriott international  inc marriott manages of our properties 
for these marriott managed hotels  the fiscal year reflects twelve weeks of operations for each of the first three quarters of the year and seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year 
therefore  in any given quarterly period  period over period results will have different ending dates 
for marriott managed hotels  the fourth quarters of  and ended december   january   and january   respectively 
revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire year 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in adr are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees

room revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
the room revenue increase resulting from the improved occupancy in of basis points was partially offset by the decrease in average daily rate 
the 
table of contents economic downturn placed tremendous pressure on rates to maintain occupancy levels 
food and beverage revenue experienced a decline of million due to lower volume on catering and banquet events 
other revenue  which consists mainly of telecommunication  parking  spa and golf fees  experienced a million decline due to less demand for these services 
rental income from the triple net operating lease decreased  primarily due to the lower hotel revenues related to that hotel property resulting from the lower average daily rate net of the effect of slightly higher occupancy during interest income from notes receivable decreased million for compared to this decrease is primarily due to the impairment of five mezzanine loans and the sale of one loan in our portfolio during asset management fees and other was  for and  for the decrease is primarily due to the expiration at december   of a consulting agreement with a joint venture 
hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees 
we experienced increases of million in direct expenses and  in indirect expenses and management fees in compared to the increase in direct expense was primarily the result of improved occupancy during the direct expenses were of total hotel revenue for both and property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other decreased million for to million 
property taxes decreased million for resulting from our successful appeals for the assessed value reductions related to certain of our hotel properties  which was partially offset by the tax rate increases in some jurisdictions as city county and state governments try to maintain their tax base 
the decrease in property taxes was partially offset by the increase in insurance costs of  the increase in insurance costs is primarily due to higher premiums for property policies renewed in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million for compared to primarily due to certain assets that had been fully depreciated during the decrease is partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense as a result of capital improvements made at several hotel properties 
impairment charges 
the impairment charges for our continuing operations were million for we recorded million impairment charge on mezzanine loans  million impairment on a hotel property that is expected to be sold in the near future  and a credit of million related to the valuation adjustments on previously impaired loans in our mezzanine loan portfolio 
of the total impairment charges of million for  million was the valuation allowance recorded for the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan and million for four other mezzanine notes 
the impairment charge recorded on hotel properties for and of million and million  respectively  are included in the operating results of discontinued operations 
in evaluating possible loan impairment  we analyze our notes receivable individually and collectively for possible loan losses in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
based on the analysis  if we conclude that no loans are individually impaired  we then further analyze the specific characteristics of the loans  based on other authoritative guidance to determine if there would be probable losses in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
the loans in our portfolio are collateralized by hotel properties 
some loans are collateralized by single hotel properties and others by hotel portfolios 
the hotel properties are in different geographic locations  have different ages and a few of the properties have recently completed significant renovations which have a significant impact on the value of the underlying collateral 
the hotel properties include independent and nationally recognized brands in all segments and classes including luxury  economy  extended stay  full service  and select service 
in addition  our loan assets vary by position in the related borrower s capital structure  ranging from junior mortgage participations to mezzanine loans 
the terms of our notes or participations were structured based on the different features of the related collateral and the priority in the borrower s capital structure 
the authoritative accounting guidance requires that an individual loan not impaired individually be included in the assessment of the loss in a group of loans only if specific characteristics of the loan indicate that it is probable that there would be an incurred loss in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
as loans in our portfolio have 
table of contents significantly different risk factors and characteristics  such as different maturity terms  different types and classes of collateral  different interest rate structures  and different priority status  we concluded that the characteristics of the loans within the portfolio were not sufficiently similar as to allow an evaluation of these loans as a group for possible impairment within the authoritative accounting guidance 
investments in hotel properties are reviewed for impairment for each reporting period 
we take into account the latest operating cash flows and market conditions and their impact on future projections 
for the properties that showed indicators of impairment  we perform a recoverability analysis using the sum of each property s estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the property s carrying value 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions about the future operating results including disposition of the property 
in addition  the cash flow estimation periods used are based on the properties remaining useful lives to us expected holding periods 
for properties securing mortgage loans  the assumptions regarding holding periods considered our ability and intent to hold the property to or beyond the maturity of the related indebtedness 
in analyzing projected hotel properties operating cash flows  we factored in revpar growth based on data from third party sources 
in addition  the projected hotel properties operating cash flows factored in our ongoing implementation of asset management strategies to minimize operating costs 
after factoring in the expected revenue growth and the impact of company specific strategies implemented to minimize operating costs  the hotel properties estimated future undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the properties carrying values 
with the exception of the three hilton hotel properties  the analyses performed in did not identify any other properties with respect to which an impairment loss should be recognized 
for a full description of impairment charges  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the executive overview 
transaction acquisition and contract termination costs 
we have been in negotiation with the borrowers  their equity holders  senior secured lenders and senior mezzanine lenders with respect to possible restructuring of the two mezzanine tranches owned by our joint ventures with prei associated with the hotel portfolio of jer highland hospitality 
the resolution of such negotiation could be consummated via a conversion of the loans into equity and assumption of senior indebtedness associated with the portfolio with us investing additional funds 
we incurred transaction acquisition costs of million related to these negotiations through december  in addition  during  we terminated the management contract of the hilton hotel property in costa mesa  california managed by hilton hotels and paid a contract termination fee of million 
this hotel property is currently managed by remington lodging 
corporate general and administrative 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased  in from the non cash stock unit based compensation expense increased million in primarily due to certain restricted stock unit based awards granted in the current year at a higher cost per share 
other corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million during primarily attributable to a decline in legal expense of million as the corporate general and administrative expenses included legal expense associated with defaulted mezzanine loan activities 
equity loss earnings in unconsolidated joint venture 
equity loss in unconsolidated joint venture was million for and equity earnings for were million 
the decrease is primarily due to all the three mezzanine loans held in our joint ventures being in non accrual status since july in addition  the borrowers of the mezzanine loan tranche held in our joint venture with prei related to the jer highland hospitality portfolio stopped making debt service payments in august and we are currently negotiating a restructuring with their equity holders  senior secured lenders and senior mezzanine lenders 
due to our junior participation status  it is expected the tranche mezzanine loan will be completely extinguished in the restructuring 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million for the entire carrying value of our investment in the joint venture on december  interest income 
interest income decreased  in compared to primarily due to lower average cash balance and the decline in short term interest rates in 
table of contents other income 
other income was million and million in and  respectively 
other income included income from non hedge interest rate swaps  floors and flooridors of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the new interest rate derivatives we entered into since july also included in were a gain of million recognized on the sale of a mezzanine note receivable  income of million recognized for business interruption insurance proceeds received related to hotel properties sold in  and a gain of  from the sale of our interest in a laundry joint venture 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs increased million to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to certain debt that was refinanced at higher interest rates 
the increase was partially offset by the lower average variable rate debt outstanding and the lower libor rates in the period 
average libor rates for and were and  respectively 
write off of loan cost and exit fees 
during we refinanced the mortgage loan secured by the gateway arlington marriott hotel property and incurred prepayment penalty of million and wrote off the unamortized loan cost of  during we refinanced mortgage debt totaling million 
the unamortized premiums of million and loan costs of  on the refinanced loans were written off 
unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
we recorded an unrealized gain of million in and an unrealized loss of million in on our interest rate derivatives 
the fair value of these derivatives increased during primarily due to the movements in the libor forward curve used in determining the fair value 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense for continuing operations was a benefit of  for and an expense of million for the decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to our being able to record an income tax benefit of  in in connection with losses incurred by our joint venture partnership that is subject to district of columbia income taxes 
this benefit is largely offset by our accruals for the texas margin tax and our federal and state income tax accruals for one of our trs subsidiaries that began generating taxable income in the fourth quarter of our accrual for the texas margin tax was lower than in prior years primarily due to the tax write off of mezzanine loans in that had been impaired in prior years for financial reporting purposes

inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities are subject to inflation as well 
seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months 
this seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements and do not currently anticipate any such arrangements
