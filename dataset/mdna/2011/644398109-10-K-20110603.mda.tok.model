item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note segment and geographic information within the notes to consolidated financial statements 
transactional tv segment the transactional tv segment generated the majority of its revenue in fiscal year through the distribution of adult programming on domestic vod platforms 
vod distribution primarily occurs through cable multiple system operators  or msos  and telephone company operators that also provide 
table of contents television services 
vod presents viewers with layered menus  similar to what is traditionally found in hotel room television offerings 
these menus allow users to interactively select a movie and then view it immediately or at a later time once the transaction has been executed 
vod tends to have a more accretive impact on our transactional tv segment business relative to our ppv offering because of the variety of content available through vod platforms and because of the flexibility vod provides in viewing times 
our transactional tv segment also distributes adult programming to cable and satellite television companies through ppv channels 
ppv provides consumers access to a timed block of programming for example  a movie or an event for a fee payable to the cable or satellite providers 
our ppv programming is offered on channels that are available to viewers through the same electronic program guides that display basic cable channels 
some of our distributors also offer our transactional tv segment channels on a monthly subscription basis 
however  the large majority of the ppv revenue we generate is based on individual movie purchases  while subscription revenue represents a small portion of the segment total ppv revenue 
we earn revenue by receiving a percentage sometimes referred to as a split of the total retail purchase price paid by consumers to purchase our content on customers vod and ppv platforms 
our transactional tv segment products have historically been sold by our customers for a price of between and for a single movie or event as determined by our customers with input from us 
we believe that as a result of the economic downturn  domestic consumers that have historically purchased our content are purchasing less of our content or are viewing content through less expensive alternatives such as low cost and free internet websites 
our content is a relatively expensive choice of entertainment as compared to other options including mainstream categories of content on our customers platforms and adult content on other off platform media such as the internet 
we believe the high price of our content is contributing to the consumer trend of purchasing less of our content or purchasing other comparable content through alternative media 
in order to confirm this assumption and determine whether reducing the price of our content could improve overall gross revenue  we are performing price tests with certain customers to determine whether decreasing the price of our content could generate an increase in the buy volume sufficient to maintain or increase total gross revenue 
we continue to investigate the initial results of the tests and although certain test sites have reported positive results  there remains uncertainty regarding the proper price point 
we believe additional analysis is required to determine the optimum price point necessary to generate and sustain category growth that is consistent with the successful test site results 
we continue to believe our vod and ppv programming provides an attractive form of entertainment because it is offered conveniently in the comfort of consumers homes and can be viewed on a large  high quality television 
during fiscal years  and    and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenue was attributed to the transactional tv segment 
the transactional tv segment distributes content to nearly every television provider in the us including the two largest providers of dbs services in the us  all major cable television systems  and the two telephone company providers of cable television services 
during fiscal year  we began expanding our services into international markets in north america  europe and latin america 
we have also recently launched new services in asia 
we believe the business model that we have successfully executed in the us will also be successful in international markets 
international expansion has also provided us with an opportunity to leverage our existing content libraries and technology infrastructure 
additionally  the revenue percentages we receive in international markets are typically higher than the percentages we receive in the us because the international cable and satellite markets are less consolidated  which allows us to negotiate higher revenue percentages 
thus far  we have had success in expanding our distribution to international 
table of contents markets and generated approximately million of transactional tv segment vod and ppv international revenue during fiscal year we plan to continue to expand our footprint to new international locations and customers  and gain additional market share and shelf space in international markets where we currently distribute content 
we believe our international expansion will be a key component of our growth over the next five to seven years 
programming strategy the transactional tv segment programming is designed to provide a wide variety of content to consumers while at the same time utilizing available films from our content library 
the programming strategy is intended to not duplicate films across our channels or between vod and ppv during a programming month 
through this strategy  we believe we are able to give consumers access to more unique films  a wider variety of actors and actresses  and a greater variety of studio representation 
we focus on prime time viewing blocks and program specific types of content in those blocks to create an appointment viewing calendar designed to drive viewers to traditionally less popular times for viewing adult content 
our programming department spends a significant amount of time and resources researching consumer choices and preferences 
we periodically perform primary consumer research to understand buying habits and to obtain information on how we can best provide our consumers with an exceptional viewing experience 
we also dedicate resources to analyzing performance data from our products as well as our competitors products 
we believe this research and analysis has enhanced our transactional tv segment performance and has assisted us in providing customer satisfaction 
additionally  we use this research to recommend changes to our customers platforms in order to improve the overall performance of the adult content category 
content delivery system our transactional tv segment delivers its ppv video programming to cable and satellite operators via satellite through in house digital broadcast technology 
the program signal is encrypted so that it is unintelligible unless it is passed through the properly authorized decoding devices 
the signal is transmitted uplinked by a third party earth station to a designated transponder on a third party commercial communications satellite 
the transponder receives the program signal that has been uplinked by the earth station  amplifies the program signal and then broadcasts downlinks the signal to commercial satellite dishes located within the satellite area of signal coverage 
the programming is downlinked by msos and dbs providers at their head ends and uplink centers 
this programming is received in the form of a scrambled signal 
we provide these operators with decoder equipment which allows them to decode the signal and then re distribute it via their own systems 
our transactional tv segment maintains a satellite transponder lease agreement for one full time digital transponder with a total bandwidth of approximately mhz on the galaxy satellite  approximately mhz on the nss satellite  and approximately mhz on hot bird these transponders provide the satellite transmission necessary to broadcast our transactional tv segment networks 
the signal of the satellites that we use covers the continental us  alaska  hawaii  latin america  europe  north africa and portions of the caribbean islands and canada 
our transactional tv segment delivers its vod service to domestic cable msos primarily through transport services provided by tvn entertainment corporation 
international vod services are delivered through alternative methods such as shipping hard drives that contain content as well as through electronic transfer and related delivery methods 

table of contents digital broadcast technology our digital broadcast infrastructure allows us to ingest  encode  edit  play out  store and digitally deliver our vod and ppv services 
we also maintain one of the largest digital libraries of its kind 
our infrastructure is scalable and includes playlist automation for all channels  encoding and playout to air  a storage area network for near line content movement and storage  archiving capability in a digital format  and complete integration of our proprietary media asset management database for playlist automation and program scheduling 
programming we obtain our programming for each vod service and ppv network primarily by licensing content distribution rights from producers 
we generally obtain distribution rights for a five year term 
we also produce programming in order to develop unique and new content 
we acquire and produce films and scenes each month 
in addition  we may license entire content libraries on an as needed basis or in order to facilitate a larger transaction 
licensed programming undergoes rigorous quality control processes prior to broadcast in order to ensure compliance with strict internal and external broadcasting standards 
we obtain age verification documentation for each film we license in accordance with federal statutes 
this documentation is maintained on site for the duration of the license term in accordance with usc and usc et seq 
we maintain an office in california that a ensures all legal documentation is obtained for each film and scene licensed  b ensures acquired content is technically compliant  and c once the film is deemed acceptable  ships the film  related documentation and promotional content to our boulder  colorado location 
our transactional tv segment in house programming and editing departments in boulder conduct preliminary screening of potentially licensable content  license acceptable content  conform content into appropriate editing standards and program the monthly schedules for all networks and vod services 
competition we believe the transactional tv segment most challenging competition has been low cost and free internet websites 
we believe that the decline in economic conditions has caused consumers to seek lower cost options for obtaining adult content 
as a result of the growth in low cost and free internet websites over the past several years  we believe a portion of the consumers who would otherwise purchase our content have been electing to obtain their content through these low cost and free internet websites 
our primary consumer research findings are consistent with the above assumptions 
our research has also indicated that these consumers might transition back from the low cost and free internet websites to our products if there are improvements to our products value proposition  such as a reduction in our products retail price 
our primary direct competitor in this segment has historically been playboy enterprises  inc playboy which  through its playboy tv service and its spice digital networks  has a long operating history in the adult entertainment space 
over the past several years  we have been successful in competing with playboy  and we have gained market share through the displacement of playboy services 
other competitors  such as hustler tv  have also entered the market and are increasing competition 
our content has typically outperformed our competitors content on the majority of mso and dbs platforms as measured by revenue per server hour 
as a result  we have been able to increase our shelf space on these platforms through incremental platform hours and the replacement of our competitors hours 
we believe that some competitors have been willing to execute contracts with distributors that contain lower revenue percentages and or provide revenue guarantees in order to obtain or retain channels and vod platform hours 
while we believe that our content continues to 
table of contents outperform the competition  we cannot predict whether that performance advantage will insulate us from further pressure on revenue percentages 
if our competitors continue to accept lower revenue percentages from the mso and dbs platforms and if we are unable to maintain a performance advantage or cause the mso and dbs providers to recognize the value from this performance advantage  then our customers could put additional pressure on us to lower our revenue percentages 
a reduction in our revenue percentages would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also face competition in the adult entertainment market from other providers of adult programming including producers of adult content  adult video dvd rentals and sales  premium movie channels that broadcast adult themed content  telephone adult chat lines  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  and adult oriented wireless services 
our transactional tv segment also faces general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other television networks  feature films  and other programming 
film production segment our film production segment is a multi faceted film production and distribution company 
the film production segment expands our portfolio to the mainstream and erotic markets and provides us with expanded relationships in international markets 
additionally  we have leveraged our existing transactional tv segment customer relationships and deliver the film production segment library of erotic and mainstream content to many of the same transactional tv segment mso and dbs customers 
our film production segment derives revenue from two principal businesses the production and distribution of original motion pictures including erotic thrillers and horror movies collectively  owned content  and the distribution of third party films where we act as a sales agent for the product repped content 
this segment also periodically provides producer for hire services to major hollywood studios 
the film markets have been significantly impacted by the economic downturn 
as a result of the impact of the economic downturn  we believe the film production segment customers have reduced their content acquisition budgets 
we believe this occurred because our customers were relying upon their existing libraries to reduce spending and costs 
these changes have had a significant negative impact on the film production segment operating results 
during fiscal years and  we incurred goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
we also recorded film cost impairment charges of approximately million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively  as well as an increase in the allowance for unrecoverable accounts of million in each of fiscal years and these charges were incurred as a result of the depressed performance of the film production segment 
it is reasonably possible that the unfavorable conditions within the film markets could persist or further decline  which could cause the operating results of this segment to remain depressed or continue to decline 
owned content revenue the film production segment produces and distributes its owned content to three primary customer groups 
the first customer group consists of cable mso and dbs service providers 
since our acquisition of the film production segment  we have leveraged our existing transactional tv segment relationships and established new customer opportunities for our film production segment owned content 
the owned content that is distributed through ppv appears on unbranded linear channels within the mainstream or adult ppv movie location of the platform electronic programming guide 
content that is distributed through vod appears within menu categories such as uncensored 
our movies are sold to end users at retail prices typically ranging from to 
we receive a 
table of contents percentage share of the revenue derived from sales on these platforms 
revenue percentages are typically higher than those earned by our transactional tv segment due to the mainstream nature of the content 
owned content is distributed to cable mso and dbs service providers using the same technology and transport providers as described above in the transactional tv segment discussion 
the second customer group for our owned content distribution consists of premium movie service providers such as cinemax and showtime 
the premium movie service providers license and distribute the content as part of their late night programming and within their subscription vod product 
the owned content is typically sold to these customers for a flat license fee 
the third customer group consists of various international distributors including international premium movie service providers 
these international distributors typically re distribute the content to end users 
we also typically charge these customers a flat license fee for the owned content 
the film production segment does not employ production staff employees 
third party production staff is used to produce owned content  and our employees provide in house oversight over the critical areas of production such as scripting  casting  shoot location  and post production 
sales agency repped content service revenue our film production segment has established relationships with independent mainstream film producers 
we act as a sales agent for the film producers and license both domestic and international rights to their movies  which we refer to as repped content  under lightning entertainment group  inc we also license films under our mainline releasing group brand 
we earn a commission for licensing film rights on behalf of these producers 
the commission we earn from domestic distribution is typically more favorable than the commission we earn from international distribution 
we also earn a marketing fee for many of the films that we represent 
each contract typically allows for the recovery of any producer advances and costs incurred in preparing the film for market  including advertising costs  screening costs  costs to prepare the trailer  box art  screening material  and similar costs necessary to ensure the movie is market ready 
we generate revenue from these arrangements  which we refer to as repped content revenue  through arrangements with mainstream distributors world wide 
distributors deliver the repped content through various channels including theatrical  pay television  free television and other similar distribution channels 
we also distribute repped content on vod platforms through us cable msos 
we continue to leverage the relationships we have established through the transactional tv segment with us cable and dbs providers 
additionally  our repped content is distributed to retail markets including dvd markets  home video markets and other retail markets through arrangements we have executed with leading independent mainstream distribution partners 
producer for hire and other revenue producer for hire and other revenue relates to amounts earned through producer for hire arrangements  music royalty fees and the delivery of other miscellaneous film materials to customers 
through our producer for hire arrangements  we provide services and incur costs associated with a film production  and we earn a fee for our services once the film has been delivered to the customer 
although we maintain no ownership rights for the produced content  we are responsible for the management and oversight of the project and incur significant economic risk until the project is completed 
the gross margins we generate from producer for hire arrangements are less than the returns we generate from our owned content and have historically been between and of net revenue  however  we cannot reasonably predict whether the gross margins we receive will continue to be similar to those generated historically 
we generated approximately million and million of producer for hire services revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
no material producer for hire revenue was generated during fiscal year we do not currently expect to execute a producer for hire arrangement in fiscal year 
table of contents competition for our owned content  we compete primarily with one small  privately owned company and other branded content such as girls gone wild and howard stern 
with respect to our sales agency business  we compete with approximately privately owned companies 
we compete with these companies based on licensing fees charged  content quality  ability to deliver our products on time  relationships with decision makers in the industry  and the professionalism of our sales team 
for our producer for hire services  we compete against a wide variety of independent movie producers 
direct to consumer segment our direct to consumer segment derives revenue primarily through subscriptions to its adult consumer websites 
content for the websites is primarily obtained through licensing agreements executed by our transactional tv segment for broadcast rights 
traffic to our consumer websites is derived through either a targeted network of affiliates that earn a referral fee from us when diverted traffic converts into paying members  or type in traffic whereby users navigate directly to the websites by typing the addresses of our websites into their web browsers 
in january  the direct to consumer segment launched a business by acquiring certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box that allowed consumers to access content through the internet and view the content on their television 
during fiscal years and  the iptv business model performance was lower than expected and as a result  we discontinued the operations of the iptv business model in the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note discontinued operations within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our discontinuation of the iptv set top box business 
competition the adult internet industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented given the relatively low barriers to entry 
free content websites that allow users to access large libraries of content have created an even more challenging environment 
other information intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our rights is difficult 
additionally  third parties might independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
seasonality we have not experienced any material seasonality within our business during the fiscal years ended march   or working capital we fund our operations through a combination of available cash  cash equivalents  and cash flows generated from operations 
in addition  our line of credit is available for additional working capital needs 

table of contents customers we derived of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  from comcast corporation comcast  directv  inc directv  dish network dish  and time warner cable inc time warner 
we generate revenue from these customers through our transactional tv and film production segments

item a 
risk factors 
the loss of any of our current major customers  or our inability to maintain or negotiate at renewal or otherwise favorable contractual terms with these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we have agreements with the ten largest us cable msos and two largest us dbs providers 
for our fiscal year ended march   the aggregate revenue we received from our major customers customers that account for or more of our consolidated net revenue during any one of the fiscal years ended march   or  namely comcast  dish  directv and time warner was approximately of our total company wide revenue 
our agreements with these operators may be terminated without penalty and with little advance notice  and as a result are sometimes subject to renegotiation during their stated term 
if one or more of these cable mso or dbs operators terminates or does not renew our agreements  or negotiates mid term or agrees only to renew the agreements on terms less favorable than those of our current agreements including removing or replacing with a competitive offering or otherwise one or more of our ppv channels or vod offerings from their platforms  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 

table of contents if the general economic environment  consumer discretionary spending or other conditions continue to be unfavorable or further deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we believe consumers view our content as a discretionary item rather than a necessity 
accordingly  our results of operations tend to be more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending  including discretionary spending 
other factors  including consumer confidence  employment levels  interest rates  tax rates  consumer debt levels  and fuel and energy costs  could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits 
we believe many of these factors have adversely affected consumer spending during each of our three fiscal years ended march   and  and  consequently  our business and results of operations 
for example  our transactional tv segment revenue decreased in fiscal year by approximately despite generating international revenue of million 
we also experienced challenging conditions within our film production segment that caused operating losses during fiscal years  and if the general economic environment  consumer discretionary spending or other conditions continue to be unfavorable or further deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we rely on third party service providers to deliver our content to our customers via satellite uplink  transponder and vod transport services 
if these services were disrupted  it could cause us to lose revenue and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
our satellite uplink  transponder and vod transport provider services are critical to us 
if our service providers fail to provide the contracted services  our programming operations would in all likelihood be suspended  resulting in a loss of substantial revenue 
if our satellite uplink and transponder providers improperly manage their facilities  we could experience signal disruptions and other quality problems that  if not immediately addressed  could cause us to lose revenue 
all our domestic transactional tv segment vod transport services are provided by tvn entertainment corporation tvn 
if tvn fails to provide the contracted services  our domestic transactional tv segment vod programming operations would in all likelihood be suspended resulting in a materially adverse impact to our financial position and results of operations 
our continued access to satellite transponders is critical to us 
our satellite transponder agreements expire through october our satellite programming operations require continued access to satellite transponders to transmit programming to our cable and dbs customers 
limitations to satellite transponder capacity could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
access to transponders may be restricted or denied if we or the satellite owner is indicted or otherwise charged as a defendant in a criminal proceeding  the federal communications commission issues an order initiating a proceeding to revoke the satellite owner authorization to operate the satellite  the satellite owner is ordered by a court or governmental authority to deny us access to the transponder  a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions  we are deemed by a governmental authority to have violated any obscenity law  or our satellite transponder provider determines that the content of our programming is harmful to its name or business 

table of contents our ability to convince cable operators and dbs providers to carry our programming is critical to us 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain carriage with cable operators and dbs providers in the future 
if we are unable to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment  we will not be able to sustain or increase revenue 
our ability to increase or sustain revenue is impacted by our ability to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment 
we face competition in the adult entertainment industry from other providers of adult programming  adult video dvd rentals and sales  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  adult oriented telephone chat lines  adult oriented internet services  including free website content services  premium movie channels that broadcast adult themed content and adult oriented wireless services 
to a lesser extent  we also face general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other television networks  feature films  and other programming and entertainment options 
our ability to compete depends on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the quality and appeal of our competitors content relative to our offerings  the strength of our competitors brands  the technology utilized by our competitors  the effectiveness of our competitors sales  marketing efforts and the attractiveness of their product offerings  general consumer behaviors  and preferences on how consumers choose to spend their discretionary income 
our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  as well as better name recognition than we do 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their product offerings 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive technology research and development  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their content 
additionally  increased competition could result in license fee reductions  lower margins and a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the popularity and notoriety of adult entertainment through low cost and free websites has resulted in additional pressure on our business 
the quality and quantity of content available on these free and low cost websites continues to improve 
the content we sell through the transactional tv segment typically has a retail price between and and is typically less explicit than the content offered on internet websites 
as a result of the recent deterioration in economic conditions  customers may view internet delivered content as a replacement to our content based on the difference in cost  edit standard and availability of certain niche content that we do not distribute 
a migration of customers to free and low cost internet delivered content could result in a further decline in our buy rates and have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the continued addition of new competitors to our business could have a material adverse affect on our operating performance 
we face competition from established adult video producers  as well as independent companies that distribute adult entertainment  some of which is provided for free through internet websites 
these competitors may include producers such as hustler  wicked pictures and vivid entertainment 
in the event that cable and or satellite companies seek to purchase adult video content for their ppv or vod service directly from adult video producers or other independent distributors of such content  our vod and ppv business is likely to suffer 
for example  an independent producer of adult content  which has historically distributed content only through the internet  replaced one of our ppv channels on the largest dbs platform in the us during the third quarter of fiscal year increased competition in the adult category could also lead to downward pressure on the license fees that our customers are willing to pay for our content 

table of contents we may incur costs to defend ourselves against legal claims initiated in connection with our distribution of adult themed content 
because of the adult oriented content that we distribute  we may be subject to obscenity or other legal claims by third parties 
our financial position and results of operations could be harmed if we were found liable for this content or if costs to defend such claims proved significant 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure to this liability may require us to take steps that would substantially limit the attractiveness of our content and or its availability in various geographic areas  which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue 
furthermore  our insurance may not cover or may not adequately protect us against all of these types of claims 
increased government regulation in the united states and abroad could impede our ability to deliver our content and expand our business 
new laws or regulations  or the new application of existing laws could prevent us from making our content available in various jurisdictions or otherwise have a material adverse affect on our business  financial position and operating results 
these new laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  taxation  user privacy and other matters relating to our products and services 
moreover  the application of internet related laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  pornography  obscenity  libel  employment  and personal privacy is still developing 
cable and dbs operators could become subject to new governmental regulations that could further restrict their ability to broadcast our programming 
if new regulations make it more difficult for cable and dbs operators to broadcast our programming  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because we have expanded our service offerings to international markets  we must now comply with diverse and evolving international regulations 
new application of regulations related to our operations internationally and our ability to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operation 
changes in our effective tax rate or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results 
we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions  both domestically and internationally 
significant judgment is required in the determination of our income tax benefit expense  and this determination requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations 
our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates  in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  and by changes in tax rules and regulations 
for instance  the availability and timing of lapses in the us research and development tax credit  the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the amount of our estimated tax deduction for domestic production activities may add more variability to our future effective tax rates 
additionally  we are subject to examination of our fiscal year amended tax returns  current tax returns and our determination of certain tax positions 
if the internal revenue service audits these returns and determines certain of our tax positions are invalid  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if the film production segment produces  acquires or represents film content that is not well received by our customers  we may not be able to recover the investments made in the film content 
we have a history of impairing films in our content library and recording allowances for unrecoverable accounts for recoupable costs and producer advances 
the film production segment ability to continue to create or acquire film content and obtain rights to represent content that is well received by our customers is critical to the segment future success 
if a film produced  acquired or represented by the film production segment does not sell as well as anticipated  we may not be able to recover our investment in the film  including  but not limited to  the cost of producing or acquiring the film  the costs associated with promoting the film  costs associated with post production work on the film  or advances and other recoupable costs associated with representing the film

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation  as amended  and our rights agreement may discourage or prevent a change of control 
our charter documents may inhibit a takeover or change in control that our shareholders may consider beneficial 
provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of us  or making a merger or acquisition less desirable to a potential acquirer  even when the shareholders may consider the acquisition or merger favorable 
for example  our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  may issue preferred stock that could delay or prevent a change of control as well as reduce the voting power of the holders of common stock  even with the effect of losing control to others 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill  that may delay or prevent a change of control and may also make a merger or acquisition of us less desirable 
if a change in control transaction perceived by the shareholders to be in their best interest were delayed or blocked by our protective measures  the value of an investment in our securities may be negatively impacted 
if we are not able to retain our key executives  it may be more difficult for us to manage our operations and our financial position and result of operations could be adversely affected

our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are engaged in a business that has experienced significant technological change over the past several years and will likely continue to experience further changes 
as a result  we face all the risks inherent in businesses that are subject to rapid technological advancement  such as the possibility that a technology that we have invested in becomes obsolete  our inability to identify in a timely manner emerging technologies that may impact our business  or technology advancement that may make our offerings obsolete 
in any such event  we may be required to invest significant amounts of capital in new technology 
our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit such new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
our ability to implement our business plan and to achieve the results projected by management will be dependent upon management ability to predict technological advances and implement strategies to take advantage of such changes 
we may also experience impairments related to existing investments that we have made in new technology 

table of contents negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by opponents of adult content could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
we could become a target of negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by one or more advocacy groups who oppose the distribution of adult entertainment 
these groups have mounted negative publicity campaigns  filed lawsuits and encouraged boycotts against companies whose businesses involve adult entertainment 
the costs of defending against any such negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts could be significant  could hurt our finances and could discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
as a leading provider of adult entertainment  we cannot assure you that we may not become a target of such negative publicity in the future 
because we are involved in the adult programming business  it may be more difficult for us to raise money or attract market support for our stock 
some banking entities  investors  investment banking entities  market makers  lenders and other service providers in the investment community may decide not to provide financing to us  or to participate in our public market or other activities due to the nature of our business  which  in turn  may adversely impact the value of our stock  and our ability to attract market support or obtain financing 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or others may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property 
third parties could assert infringement claims against our business in the future 
claims for infringement of all types of intellectual property rights are a common source of litigation 
infringement claims can require us to modify our products  services and technologies or require us to obtain a license to permit our continued use of those rights 
we may not be able to perform either of these actions in a timely manner or upon reasonable terms and conditions 
failure to do so could harm our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  future litigation relating to infringement claims could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of management resources 
adverse determinations in any litigation or proceeding could also subject us to significant liabilities and could prevent us from selling some of our products  services or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services 
the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business 
if we experience system failures  the services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted  which could harm our business reputation and result in a loss of customers 
our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our digital broadcast technology and related systems 
any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of revenue and customers 
our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire  natural disaster  unlawful acts  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized entry  computer viruses  or similar events 
although we have taken steps to prevent system failures  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful and that we will not experience service interruptions 
further  our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

table of contents our goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets may incur further charges and expenses 
we conducted our annual goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets impairment tests as of march   and we also performed goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets impairment tests as of december  due to events and circumstances within our film production segment that caused us to believe that it was more likely than not that the segment goodwill was impaired

the ongoing uncertainty in general economic and market conditions could increase the likelihood of additional asset charges and expenses being recorded in future periods 
in addition  the determination of the fair value of goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets as well as the estimated recoverability of recoupable costs and producer advances is subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity and changes in estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations

overview we are a provider of transactional television services and a distributor of general motion picture entertainment 
our key customers include large cable and satellite operators  premium movie channel providers and major hollywood studios 
we distribute content worldwide 
our three principal businesses are reflected in the transactional tv  film production and direct to consumer operating segments 
our transactional tv segment distributes adult content to cable and satellite operators who then distribute the content to retail consumers via vod and ppv technology 
we earn revenue by receiving a contractual percentage of the retail price paid by consumers to purchase our content on customers vod and ppv platforms 
the transactional tv segment has historically been our most profitable segment 
the film production segment generates revenue through the distribution of mainstream content to large cable and satellite operators  premium movie channel providers and other content distributors 
this segment also periodically provides contract film production services to major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
the film production segment incurred operating losses in fiscal years  and primarily due to impairment charges 
our direct to consumer segment primarily generates revenue from membership fees earned through the distribution of adult content to consumer websites 
the direct to consumer segment has historically incurred operating losses and is expected to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  however  we have been focused on returning the segment to profitability through efforts described below 
our corporate administration segment includes all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc the business models of each of our segments are summarized below 
transactional tv segment the transactional tv segment is focused on the distribution of content to consumers via mso and dbs customers vod and ppv services 
we earn revenue by receiving a percentage sometimes referred to as a split of the total retail purchase price paid by consumers to purchase our content on customers vod and ppv platforms 
revenue growth can occur when we launch our services to new cable msos or dbs providers primarily in international markets  when the number of digital subscribers for systems where our services are currently distributed increases  when we launch additional services or replace our competitors services on existing customer cable and dbs platforms  and when our proportional buy rates improve relative to our competitors 
alternatively  our revenue could decline if we were to experience lower consumer buy rates  as has been the case with the recent general economic downturn  if consumers migrate to other forms of entertainment such as pay and free adult oriented internet websites which we believe may also be occurring as a result of the economic downturn  if our customers pay us a smaller percentage of the consumer retail purchase price  if additional competitive channels are added to our customers platforms or if our existing customers remove or replace our services on their platform 
beginning in fiscal year  we focused the transactional tv segment growth efforts on expanding distribution into international markets 
the expansion of the transactional tv segment distribution into international markets continues to be one of our primary focuses for growth within the 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued segment 
we currently distribute content in international markets including north america  europe  latin america and asia 
the transactional tv segment international revenue during the fiscal years ended march   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the large majority of the international growth within the transactional tv segment has occurred though the distribution of content to vod platforms 
in fiscal year  we executed transponder agreements that allow us to distribute ppv channels in latin america and europe 
the annual cost of the leased transponders is approximately million and is expected to increase as we expand the quantity of ppv channels that we distribute internationally 
we plan to focus on executing new ppv distribution agreements with customers in the future to further expand the transactional tv segment international growth 
although the initial transponder costs associated with the international ppv expansion are higher relative to the costs to distribute content to international vod platforms  the international ppv transponder costs are fixed rather than variable relative to the related revenue 
comparatively  the transport costs associated with the international vod distribution are variable relative to revenue 
throughout fiscal year  the transactional tv segment costs increased as a result of our efforts to expand our international distribution 
the increase in expenses occurred within various areas of the transactional tv segment cost structure including transponder and uplink costs  content and distribution rights amortization  employee costs for sales  programming  and content production  depreciation of equipment  and business development consulting 
we expect the higher cost structure of the segment will continue in future periods in order to support the international expansion efforts 
if our international distribution and related revenue increase  we expect to experience improvements in our gross and operating margins as a result of the generally fixed cost structure 
if our efforts to increase revenue through international expansion are not successful or occur at a slower pace than expected  the segment could experience a further decline in gross and operating margins 
transactional tv segment revenue during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends domestic vod revenue  which represented approximately  or million  of the transactional tv segment total revenue during fiscal year  declined slightly by as compared to the prior year results 
the stabilization in the domestic vod revenue in fiscal year contrasts an decline in revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year throughout fiscal year  we have made adjustments to our programming mix and have launched new content packages with our existing customers 
we believe these efforts have contributed to the stabilization of the domestic vod revenue in fiscal year domestic ppv revenue  which represented approximately  or million  of the transactional tv segment total revenue during fiscal year  declined primarily due to lower revenue from the largest dbs provider in the us in november  the customer decreased its distribution of our channels from three channels to two channels 
also contributing to the decline in revenue was lower buy rates among dbs and top cable mso consumers 
as discussed in more detail below  we believe consumers that have historically purchased our content with discretionary income have reduced their spending on our content  eliminated their acquisition of our content  and or are viewing content through less expensive alternatives such as low cost and free internet websites  which has resulted in a decline in our domestic ppv revenue 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although we have made adjustments on domestic vod platforms in order to stabilize that revenue  we do not have flexibility to make similar adjustments on domestic ppv platforms due to the linear nature of ppv distribution 
ppv services consist of linear channel products  so consumers that receive an individual ppv service have only one available movie option through that service at a specific viewing time 
as a result  our ability to make significant changes in product mix and packages is limited as compared to the vod service  which provides consumers with a large variety of movie options at any specific viewing time 
international revenue was million in fiscal year and increased approximately as compared to the prior year 
approximately of the international revenue generated in fiscal year was from the distribution of content to vod platforms 
international revenue was higher primarily as a result of new customer launches  an increase in the quantity of content distributed to existing customers  an improvement in our content performance with existing customers  and adjustments to customer menu structures 
we believe that as a result of the economic downturn  domestic consumers that have historically purchased our content are purchasing less of our content or are viewing content through less expensive alternatives such as low cost and free internet websites 
these conditions have put pressure on the transactional tv segment domestic revenue and caused unfavorable performance over the past three years 
it is reasonably possible that difficult economic conditions will persist or worsen  which could cause our transactional tv segment results to be materially adversely impacted 
although we believe that the deterioration in the economy has negatively impacted the transactional tv segment results  it is not possible for us to quantify or reasonably estimate the financial impact 
we have remained focused on maintaining our competitive market position by offering a wide range of high quality content as well as adjusting our content mix and distributing new content packages  and we believe our product is superior to other product offerings in the industry 
our transactional tv segment is reliant on discretionary consumer purchases of our content 
when consumers spend less of their discretionary income on non essential expenses such as our content  it adversely impacts our business 
additionally  our content is a relatively expensive choice of entertainment as compared to other options including mainstream content that is available on our customers platforms and adult content that is available on off platform media such as the internet 
we believe the high price of our content is causing consumers to purchase less of our content or purchase other comparable content through alternative media 
in order to confirm this assumption and determine whether reducing the price of our content could improve overall gross revenue  we are performing price tests with certain customers to determine whether decreasing the price of our content could generate an increase in the buy volume sufficient to maintain or increase total gross revenue 
although the initial results of the price tests are positive  there remains uncertainty regarding the optimum price for our products 
as a result  we plan to continue testing various pricing and packaging models with several of our larger customers in order to compile sufficient data to recommend changes to our customers 
when considering the future operating results of the transactional tv segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact the segment future operating results declines in new and existing consumer buys of adult tv services due to a migration to other lower cost or free adult media services such as the internet  adverse impacts to our business from a continued decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions or otherwise  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued slowing growth of the overall adult entertainment category and limited incremental distribution opportunities within the us  reductions in opportunities to gain domestic market share due to our customers efforts to maintain competition among platform programmers  challenges associated with our continued expansion into international markets and our inexperience with international customers  buy rates  and consumer habits  increased pressure from customers that threaten to remove one or more of our channels or content from their platform if we do not reduce the revenue percentages we receive or provide minimum guarantees  increased vod competition from established adult entertainment companies or new entrants such as production studios and internet based distributors because the barriers of entry for this product line are low  and continued product commoditization 
in addition to the above noted risks  our agreements typically allow our customers to make significant changes to our distribution such as reduce the quantity of our vod content or remove one or more ppv channels from the platform and may be terminated on relatively short notice without penalty 
if one or more of our cable mso or dbs operators changes our distribution terms  terminates or does not renew our agreements  or does not renew the agreements on terms as favorable as those of our current agreements  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
all the above mentioned challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and future periods  we believe that the transactional tv segment could experience revenue growth if we can successfully manage and are not materially adversely impacted by the challenges and risks previously mentioned 
we currently expect future growth in the segment to occur if we are successful with the following objectives continuing our international distribution expansion into new and existing geographic locations  improving the value proposition for consumers  such as reducing the retail price of our content to increase buy volume  replacing our competitors ppv channels with our channels on both existing and new customer platforms  increasing the proportional vod hours we receive on existing customer platforms  gaining new carriage on emerging consumer electronic platforms such as connected televisions  blu ray players  and gaming consoles  transitioning cable mso and dbs providers to less edited content standards  and improving the mix of programming 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued film production segment the film production segment has historically derived the majority of its revenue from two principal businesses the production and distribution of original motion pictures including erotic thrillers and horror movies collectively  owned content  and the distribution of third party films where we act as a sales agent for the product repped content 
this segment also periodically provides contract film production services to certain major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
we generate revenue by licensing our owned content for a one time fee to free tv  premium tv and other domestic and international distributors 
we also leverage our existing relationships with transactional tv segment customers and license the film production segment owned content to domestic and international cable mso and dbs providers through revenue percentage arrangements that are structured in a similar manner to our transactional tv segment agreements 
the revenue percentages we receive from cable mso and dbs providers for the film production segment content are higher than the revenue percentages we receive for our transactional tv segment content primarily due to the mainstream nature of the content 
however  the retail price for our mainstream content is lower than our transactional tv segment content  so the per buy revenue per transaction is often the same as the transactional tv segment 
we generate repped revenue through sales agency arrangements whereby we earn a sales commission and marketing fees by selling mainstream films on behalf of film producers 
the film production segment has established relationships with independent mainstream filmmakers and represents these filmmakers movies primarily through lightning entertainment group  inc beginning in late fiscal year  we leveraged our existing transactional tv segment customer relationships and began distributing repped content on vod platforms through several domestic cable msos 
we are also distributing repped content films to retail markets through distribution partners 
the film production segment periodically acts as a contract film producer for major hollywood studios 
through these producer for hire arrangements  we provide services and incur costs associated with the film production 
once the film has been delivered to the customer  we earn a fee for our services 
although we maintain no ownership rights for the produced content  we are responsible for the management and oversight of the production 
we do not produce these movies unless we have an executed agreement with a customer 
these services have historically generated a gross margin of between and 
however  our historical performance may not be representative of producer for hire performance in the future 
film production segment revenue during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends owned content revenue declined primarily due to a million decline in vod revenue due to lower consumer spending as described above in the transactional tv segment discussion 
revenue also declined because the prior year results included approximately million in revenue from the delivery of a horror film to a pay television customer  and no similar revenue recurred during fiscal year the declines in revenue were partially offset by a million increase in revenue from the delivery of the fourth installment of an episodic series  whereas only a partial delivery of films from the third installment of an episodic series occurred in the prior fiscal year 
we plan to pursue episodic productions in the future 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued repped content revenue improved due to our distribution of mainstream content to domestic vod platforms 
revenue also increased due to the distribution of content to home video  retail dvd and other markets through our arrangements with mainstream film distributors 
partially offsetting the increases in revenue was a reduction in one time repped distribution revenue  and we believe the decline is due to a reduction in spending by our customers in response to the continuation of the challenging film market conditions 
producer for hire and other revenue in fiscal year included approximately million of revenue from film production services completed in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
the fiscal year results also included approximately million of revenue related to completing the production of films from another producer for hire arrangement that generated a portion of its revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the remaining revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year this same producer for hire arrangement generated approximately million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the fiscal year results also included million of revenue from a separate producer for hire arrangement that was completed in the fourth quarter of that fiscal year 
we intend to continue to pursue producer for hire arrangements in the future 
when considering the future operating results of the film production segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact this segment operating results declines in new and existing consumer vod buys of our erotic owned content due to a migration to other lower cost or free adult services such as the internet  adverse impacts to our business from a continued depression or additional decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions  the identification and execution of owned content deals with premium movie channels could become less frequent  increased competition to our owned content from more explicit adult film offerings  adverse impacts to our business resulting from the departures of the segment co presidents during fiscal year  and we are making larger producer advances and incurring more significant costs for repped content films with larger production budgets and we may be unable to recover these advances and costs through the future sale of the films 
the impact of these challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and in future periods  we will focus on improving the revenue we generate from this segment through the following strategic initiatives generating incremental mainstream vod repped content revenue by distributing higher quality films with recognized actors and actresses through domestic cable msos  generating incremental mainstream repped content revenue by distributing higher quality films to retail markets through our arrangements with mainstream film distributors  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued improving the buy rates of vod owned content on cable mso and dbs platforms through the same methods utilized by our transactional tv segment  expanding the quantity of owned episodic series content deals we execute with premium movie channels  and identifying new opportunities to provide producer for hire services to major hollywood studios 
beginning in fiscal year  the film markets were significantly impacted by the economic downturn 
as a result  the film production segment customers reduced their content acquisition budgets 
we believe this occurred because customers were relying on their existing libraries to reduce spending and costs 
these changes significantly impacted the film production segment operating results during the third quarter of fiscal year and as a result  we made material revisions to the segment internal forecasts resulting in a million goodwill impairment charge 
we also recorded film cost impairment charges of approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of the economic downturn 
during fiscal year  the film production segment results were consistent with our internal budgets excluding the impact of the goodwill and other impairment and related charges 
however  conditions continued to be unfavorable in the film markets where we distribute content  and we believed these challenging conditions would continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the five year internal forecast for the film production segment was revised downward in connection with the year end goodwill impairment testing which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we also recorded film cost impairment charges of approximately million and an increase in the allowance for unrecoverable accounts of approximately million during fiscal year associated with the unfavorable film market conditions 
during fiscal year  owned content films continued to underperform as compared to our expectations 
additionally  the former co presidents of the segment departed 
as a result  we adjusted downward the expected future performance of certain owned content films which resulted in film cost impairment charges of million 
we also recorded an increase in the allowance for unrecoverable accounts of million because certain recoupable costs and producer advances associated with repped content films were not expected to be recovered 
if challenging conditions within the film markets persist or worsen  the operating results of the film production segment could be materially adversely impacted 
direct to consumer segment our direct to consumer segment generates revenue primarily by selling memberships to our adult consumer websites 
we have experienced declines in the direct to consumer segment revenue  which we believe is due to a decline in consumer spending as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions as well as the availability of free and low cost internet content 
we expect this segment will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  however  we have launched additional consumer websites and executed other actions in an effort to improve the segment performance in the future 
the direct to consumer segment also operated an internet protocol television iptv set top box business beginning in late fiscal year customers of the iptv set top box product could obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we discontinued the operations of the iptv business model as a result of underperformance in fiscal year see note discontinued operations within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our discontinuation of the iptv set top box business 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued corporate administration segment the corporate administration segment reflects all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal expenses  accounting expenses  human resource department costs  insurance expenses  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs  and costs associated with our public company filings and shareholder communications 
our focus for this operating segment is balancing cost containment with the need for administrative support 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments that we use in applying the accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in the financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continuously evaluate the methods  estimates and judgments 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and considerations used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the recognition of revenue  the recognition and measurement of income tax expenses  assets and liabilities including the measurement of uncertain tax positions and valuation of deferred tax assets  the assessment of film costs and the forecast of anticipated revenue ultimate revenue  which is used to amortize the film production segment film costs  the determination of the allowance for unrecoverable accounts  which reserves for certain recoupable costs and producer advances that are not expected to be recovered  the amortization methodology and valuation of content and distribution rights  and the valuation of goodwill  other identifiable intangible and other long lived assets 
each of these critical accounting policies is described in detail below 
revenue recognition our revenue consists primarily of fees earned through the distribution of programming content through various media outlets including dedicated ppv channels and vod categories that are distributed on cable and dbs platforms  premium movie channels  pay and free television channels and other available media outlets 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the services have been rendered or delivery conditions as described in the related contract have been satisfied  the license period related to the content has begun and the customer can begin exploitation of the content  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of fees is reasonably assured 
the process involved in evaluating the 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgment including estimating monthly revenue based on historical data and determining collectability of fees 
transactional tv segment vod and ppv services the transactional tv segment vod and ppv revenue are recognized based on buys and monthly subscriber counts reported each month by cable msos and dbs providers 
we earn revenue by receiving a contractual percentage of the retail price paid by consumers of the content 
monthly sales information is not typically reported to the transactional tv segment until approximately days after the month of service  which requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the transactional tv segment historical experience with each customer 
the revenue estimates may be subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the monthly sales reports 
a change in our estimated revenue as of march  would have affected our net loss by approximately million in fiscal year film production segment owned content licensing revenue from the licensing of owned content is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the delivery conditions of the completed film have been satisfied as required in the contract  the license period of the arrangement has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
for agreements that involve the distribution of content through vod and ppv services and retail markets  we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the revenue earned from customers in advance of receiving the reported earnings because the performance materially varies by film and from period to period 
as a result  licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by the customers 
film production segment repped content licensing we recognize revenue from represented film licensing activities on a net basis as an agent 
the revenue recognized for these transactions represents only the sales agency fee earned on the total content licensing fee 
the producers share of the licensing fee is recorded as a liability until the balance is remitted to the producer 
for agreements that involve the distribution of content through vod and ppv services and retail markets  we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the revenue earned from customers in advance of receiving the reported earnings because the performance materially varies by film and from period to period 
as a result  licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by the customers 
the agreements entered into with the producers may also provide for a marketing fee that can be earned by us 
the marketing fee is stated as a fixed amount and is contractually earned upon collection of sufficient film licensing fees as defined by the contract  the terms of which vary depending on film quality  distribution markets and other factors 
we recognize marketing fees as revenue when the amounts become determinable and the collection of the fee has occurred as defined by the respective contract 
direct to consumer segment membership fees revenue from membership fees is recognized over the life of the membership 
we record an allowance for refunds based on expected membership cancellations  credits and chargebacks 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining the income tax benefit expense 
these estimates and judgments are used in the determination of tax credits  benefits and deductions  uncertain tax positions  and the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which are a result of differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also use estimates and judgments in determining interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates could result in a material change to the income tax benefit expense in subsequent periods 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to recover deferred tax assets 
we have no material deferred tax asset valuation allowances and estimate that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if these estimates were to change and the assessment indicated we would be unable to recover the deferred tax assets  we would increase the income tax expense in the period of the change in estimate 
the calculation of long term taxes payable involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of tax regulations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position liabilities 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this process is based on various factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new audit activity 
changes to these factors and estimates regarding these factors could result in the recognition of an income tax benefit or an additional charge to the income tax expense 
film costs we capitalize the film production segment costs incurred for film production including costs to develop  acquire and produce films  which primarily consist of salaries  equipment and overhead costs  as well as the cost to acquire rights to films 
film costs include amounts for completed films and films still in development 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of the films 
interest expense associated with film costs is not capitalized because the duration of productions is short term in nature 
films are typically direct to television in nature 
film costs are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
capitalized film costs are amortized as an expense within cost of sales using the film forecast method 
under this method  capitalized film costs are expensed based on the proportion of the film revenue recognized for such period relative to the film estimated remaining ultimate revenue  not to exceed ten years 
ultimate revenue is the estimated total revenue expected to be recognized over a film useful life 
ultimate revenue for new films and events is typically estimated using actual historical performance of comparable films that are similar in nature such as production cost and genre 
film revenue associated with this method includes amounts from all sources on an individual film forecast computation method 
estimates of ultimate revenue are reviewed quarterly and adjusted if appropriate  and amortization is also adjusted on a prospective basis for such a change in estimate 
changes in estimated ultimate revenue could be due to a variety of factors  including the proportional buy rates of the content as compared to competitive content as well as the level of market acceptance of the television product 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued film costs are reviewed for impairment on a film by film basis each quarterly reporting period 
we record an impairment charge when the fair value of the film is less than the unamortized cost 
examples of events or circumstances that could result in an impairment charge for film costs include the underperformance of a film as compared to expectations or a downward adjustment in the estimated future performance of a film due to an adverse change in the general business climate 
impairment charges associated with film costs could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
fiscal year film cost impairments during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we recorded impairment expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with certain owned content films 
during our second quarter film performance analysis  we adjusted downward the expected performance for certain films based on a continuation of underperformance as compared to expectations 
during our fourth quarter film performance analysis  we adjusted downward the expected results for certain films based on a continued trend of lower than expected film performance and based on the recent departure of the segment co presidents 
as a result  we performed further assessments on the films and determined the fair value of the films was less than the unamortized cost of the films  and the differences were recorded as impairment charges 
the impairment charges were recorded in the charge for asset impairments other than goodwill within the film production segment 
the fair value of the films was estimated by discounting the films expected future cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital 
the weighted average cost of capital was determined by considering comparable companies and their cost of equity  cost of debt  capital structure  and other risk factors specific to the segment 
a change in the estimated future cash flows of the impaired films would have immaterially affected our net loss by less than approximately million in fiscal year a change in the weighted average cost of capital would also have immaterially affected our net loss by less than approximately million in fiscal year recoupable costs and producer advances recoupable costs and producer advances represent amounts paid by us that are expected to be subsequently recovered through the collection of fees associated with the licensing of repped content 
in connection with the film production segment repped content operations  we enter into sales agency agreements whereby we act as a sales agent for a producer film sales agency agreements 
these sales agency agreements typically include provisions whereby certain costs that are incurred for promotion related activities will be paid by us on behalf of the producer such as movie trailer and advertising material costs 
we may also pay the producer an advance for the related film prior to the distribution of such film 
as we subsequently license the producer film and license fees are collected  the recoupable costs and producer advances are recovered by us through these license fee collections 
license fees typically are not paid to the producer of the related film until such recoupable costs and producer advances have been fully recovered 
recoupable costs and producer advances are stated at the amounts contractually recoverable through collection of future license fees net of an allowance for unrecoverable accounts 
the allowance for unrecoverable accounts reflects any loss anticipated from unrecovered recoupable costs and producer advances 
charges to adjust the allowance for unrecoverable accounts are reflected as a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate recoupable costs and producer advances on an individual film by film basis each quarter based on a number of factors including our historical experience with charges to the allowance  estimates of future license fee 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued collections  estimates of future recoupable costs to be incurred  and the condition of the general economy and film industry as a whole 
a change in the allowance for unrecoverable accounts as of march  would have affected our net loss by approximately million in fiscal year content and distribution rights the transactional tv segment content and distribution rights library primarily consists of licensed films 
we capitalize the costs associated with the content and distribution rights as well as certain editing and production costs and amortize these capitalized costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of the license term or estimated useful life generally years 
these costs are amortized using a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the related revenue is expected to be recognized 
we amortize the cost of content and distribution rights on a straight line basis because each usage of the films is expected to generate similar revenue  and the revenue for the films is expected to be recognized ratably over the related license term 
we regularly review and evaluate the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis as opposed to an alternative method of amortization such as an accelerated basis 
based on these analyses  we determined that the amortization of the film library costs using a straight line basis most accurately reflects the manner in which the revenue for the related films will be recognized 
we periodically review the content library and assess whether the unamortized cost approximates the estimated net realizable value of the library based on expected forecast results 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the estimated net realizable value of the film library  we will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value to the estimated net realizable value 
goodwill  other identifiable intangible and long lived assets we record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the operating segment level  which is equivalent to our reporting units  on an annual basis march and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using considerations of various valuation methodologies which could include income and market valuation approaches 
the income approach involves discounting the reporting unit projected free cash flow at its weighted average cost of capital  and the market approach considers comparable publicly traded company valuations and recent merger and acquisition valuations 
the analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth  determination of the weighted average cost of capital  and other similar estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
we allocate goodwill to each reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the related acquisition and or combination 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units and the consolidated company  we also perform a reconciliation of the fair value estimates for the reporting units to our market capitalization 
the reconciliation considers a control premium based on merger and acquisition transactions within the media and entertainment industry and other available information 
a 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued control premium is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
other identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization have primarily included amounts paid to acquire non compete agreements with certain key executives  contractual and non contractual customer relationships  intellectual property rights  patents and websites 
these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which is typically five years 
other identifiable intangible asset balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts in the period in which they become fully amortized or impaired and are no longer in use 
for intellectual property and patents  the assets are not removed until our legal claim to the assets has expired 
we continually review long lived assets that are held and used and other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  we consider whether the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets are less than the related assets carrying value and if so  we record an impairment loss for the excess recorded carrying value of the asset as compared to its fair value 
fiscal year goodwill impairment testing we performed annual goodwill impairment testing for the transactional tv segment as of march  using the income and market valuation approaches 
the projected results used in the income valuation approach included estimates of revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  content acquisitions  capital expenditures and other related cash flows and activities over a five year future period  and the cash flows were discounted by a risk adjusted discount rate 
the market valuation approach required us to estimate and consider market multiples for companies considered to be comparable to ours and although there was a lack of comparable public companies to consider for the market valuation approach  we believe the comparable companies considered are reasonably similar to our operations 
the income valuation approach was more heavily weighted than the market valuation approach because a there was a lack of comparable public companies to consider for the market valuation approach  and b the income valuation approach was more representative of our unique operating performance characteristics relative to the comparable companies considered in the market valuation approach 
we assumed an average annual growth rate of based on both company specific and general economic risk  and we used a weighted average cost of capital of for the risk adjusted discount rate 
the weighted average cost of capital was determined by considering comparable companies and their cost of equity  cost of debt  capital structure  and other risk factors specific to the segment 
based on the testing  the fair value of the transactional tv segment exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
a change in the growth rate would cause the percentage by which the segment fair value exceeded the carrying value to change by approximately basis points 
a change in the weighted average cost of capital would cause the percentage by which the segment fair value exceeded the carrying value to change by approximately basis points 
if the five year projected future performance of the transactional tv segment as estimated in the income valuation approach is adjusted downward or is lower than expected in the future  we could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued due to the continued pressure on our stock price  our market capitalization was less than the total new frontier media  inc shareholders equity balance as of march  as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units and consolidated company  a reconciliation of the fair value estimates for the reporting units to our market capitalization based on the day average closing price of our stock was also performed as of march  the reconciliation reflected an implied control premium of  which is reflective of historical merger and acquisition transactions involving comparable companies as well as other relevant information 
based on the reconciliation  our fair value was in excess of the total new frontier media  inc shareholders equity balance by approximately  and there was no indicator of goodwill impairment 
a change in the control premium would cause the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the shareholders equity balance to change by approximately basis points 
results of operations transactional tv segment the following table sets forth certain financial information for the transactional tv segment for each of the three fiscal years presented amounts may not sum due to rounding in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs net revenue vod ppv other revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit operating expenses operating income net revenue vod international vod revenue increased during fiscal year by approximately million as compared to fiscal year international revenue was higher primarily as a result of new customer launches  an increase in the quantity of content distributed to existing customers  an improvement in our content performance with existing customers  and adjustments to customer menu structures 
domestic vod revenue experienced a minimal decline during fiscal year of million  or  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
based on our results in the second through fourth quarters of fiscal year  it appears that the domestic vod performance has generally stabilized in contrast to a declining trend in the prior fiscal year as described in more detail below 
we believe the stabilization in the domestic vod revenue was due to adjustments we made to our programming mix and our distribution of new content packages 
if the current economic conditions including high unemployment 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and lower consumer discretionary spending persist or worsen  our domestic vod performance could be materially adversely impacted 
the decline in vod revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to a reduction in revenue from several of the largest cable msos in the us we believe the decline was due to a reduction in discretionary consumer spending in response to the economic downturn 
we believe consumers that historically purchased our content with discretionary income reduced or eliminated their acquisition of our content or viewed adult content through less expensive or free alternatives such as pay and free internet websites in response to the economic downturn 
the decline in revenue was also due to a settlement of paid and unpaid historical amounts with a domestic mso customer in fiscal year that resulted in million of additional revenue  and no similar settlement occurred in fiscal year partially offsetting the decline in revenue was a a million increase in revenue primarily associated with new international vod distribution  b a million increase in domestic vod revenue associated with distribution to a new cable mso customer in the eastern us  and c a million increase in revenue from domestic telecommunication companies associated with their growth in subscribers 
ppv ppv revenue was lower during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a decline in revenue of million from the largest dbs platform in the us primarily from the loss of a channel on that platform in november revenue was also lower due to a decline in revenue from domestic dbs and top cable mso customers 
we believe consumers that have historically purchased our content with discretionary income have reduced their spending on our content  eliminated their acquisition of our content  or are viewing content through less expensive alternatives such as low cost and free internet websites  which has resulted in a decline in our domestic ppv revenue 
although we have made adjustments on domestic vod platforms in order to stabilize that revenue  we do not have flexibility to make similar adjustments on domestic ppv platforms due to the linear nature of ppv distribution 
as a result  the decline in consumer spending has had a larger unfavorable impact on our domestic ppv revenue as compared to our domestic vod revenue 
partially offsetting the decline in revenue was a million increase in international ppv revenue from our expansion into international markets primarily in latin america 
revenue from our ppv distribution declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the two largest dbs providers and other top ten cable msos in the us  which we believe was due to the general economic downturn and related reduction in discretionary consumer spending 
revenue also declined by approximately million due to our loss of a third channel on the largest dbs provider in the us in november the decline in revenue was partially offset by a million increase in revenue associated with new international launches in latin america 
other revenue other revenue primarily includes revenue from advertising on our ppv channels and from content distribution fees 
other revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a general decline in advertising and distribution activity 
we believe customers reduced or eliminated their spending on these services as a method to decrease expenses in response to the challenging economic conditions 
other revenue in fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast infrastructure  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisition and monitoring activities  vod transport  amortization of content and distribution rights  depreciation of property and equipment  and related employee costs 
cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million increase in content and distribution rights amortization from a general increase in acquisitions and the development of new and unique content incurred in an effort to improve domestic buy rates and support international expansion  b a million increase in transponder and uplink costs associated with the ppv channel launches in latin america and europe  c a million increase in employee costs to support content programming analysis  and d a million increase in costs from accelerating depreciation expense for certain tenant improvement assets 
we shortened the estimated lives of the related tenant improvement assets in anticipation of vacating our current corporate and digital broadcast facilities prior to the end of the lease terms and moving to a new building during the first half of fiscal year the increases in costs were partially offset by a decline in transport expenses from executing a new domestic transport agreement that contained more favorable financial terms 
cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million increase in transport costs to support the increase in international and domestic vod distribution  b a million increase in transponder and uplink costs to support additional domestic ppv channel offerings  and c a million increase in content and distribution amortization expense associated with licensing higher quality content to attract additional consumer purchases 
operating expenses and operating income the increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a a million increase in employee costs to support the development of new content packages and to strengthen the international sales expansion efforts  b a million increase in depreciation and maintenance expenses from purchasing storage equipment to support our international growth and the increase in domestic content distribution  c a million increase in expenses primarily from fully impairing certain content and distribution rights assets that no longer met our quality standards for distribution  d a million increase in business development consulting costs incurred in an effort to grow our international revenue  e a million increase in costs from accelerating depreciation expense for certain tenant improvement assets  f a million increase in costs because the same prior year period included a gain from a vendor settlement that did not recur during fiscal year  and g a million increase in legal costs from a vendor settlement 
operating income for fiscal year was million as compared to million in fiscal year operating expenses increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million increase in consulting fees from new business development efforts in international markets  and b a million increase in advertising and promotion costs incurred in an effort to improve domestic revenue 
operating income for fiscal year was million as compared to million in fiscal year 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating lease for new facility in october  we entered into an operating lease agreement to rent an approximately  square foot facility and expect to complete occupancy of the facility in july we expect that the leased facility will be primarily used by the transactional tv  direct to consumer and corporate administration segments  and the new facility will replace our digital broadcast and corporate facilities 
the landlord of the new facility will assume our current digital broadcast facility lease in connection with the new operating lease agreement 
the initial term of the agreement expires in january and provides for options to extend the term of the lease if agreed upon by the landlord and us 
in connection with our leasing of the new facility  we reduced the remaining estimated useful lives of certain tenant improvements related to the corporate and digital broadcast facilities we currently occupy because we expect to vacate the buildings prior to the conclusion of the original lease agreements 
as a result  we incurred an increase in depreciation expense in each of the transactional tv segment cost of sales and operating expenses of approximately million during each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year we expect to incur a similar increase in depreciation expense in the first quarter of fiscal year we also expect to incur a charge in the first quarter of fiscal year within the transaction tv segment operating expenses of approximately million associated with vacating our digital broadcast facility and assigning the remaining lease and related obligations to the landlord of the new facility 
the total remaining lease and related obligations assumed by the new facility landlord will be reflected as a reduction in our rental expense on a straight line basis over the term of the new facility lease 
additionally  we expect to incur a million charge in the second quarter of fiscal year from vacating our current corporate facility prior to the end of the lease term  and the charge is expected to be included in the operating expenses of our segments with the majority of the charge being reflected within the transactional tv segment

represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
net revenue owned content the decrease in owned content revenue during fiscal year was due to a million decline in vod revenue due to lower consumer spending as described above within the transactional tv segment discussion 
revenue also declined because the prior fiscal year results included approximately million in revenue from the delivery of a horror film to a pay television customer  and no similar revenue recurred during fiscal year the declines in revenue were partially offset by a million increase in revenue from the delivery of the fourth installment of an episodic series  whereas only a partial delivery of films from the third installment of an episodic series occurred in the prior fiscal year 
owned content revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million decline in revenue from premium cable channel customers related to the delivery 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of episodic series 
we recognized revenue in fiscal year from a premium cable channel customer for the remaining partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series  whereas in fiscal year  we recognized the full revenue from the delivery of the second installment of an episodic series as well as revenue from the initial partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series 
also contributing to the decline in revenue in fiscal year was lower revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us because fewer films were distributed on that platform in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
repped content repped content revenue includes revenue from the licensing of films that we represent but do not own under domestic and international sales agency relationships with various film producers 
repped content revenue increased during fiscal year due to million in incremental revenue from the distribution of repped content on domestic vod platforms 
revenue also increased by approximately million due to additional revenue from the distribution of content to home video  retail dvd and other retail markets through our arrangements with mainstream film distributors 
the increase in repped content revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a a million increase in revenue from the new distribution of repped content on domestic vod platforms and through retail dvd markets  and b a million increase in revenue from the distribution of content to home video and other retail markets through our arrangements with mainstream film distributors 
we also believe that our ability to represent and distribute mainstream films with widely recognized actors and actresses has contributed to the improvement in repped content revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year 
producer for hire and other revenue producer for hire and other revenue relates to amounts earned through producer for hire arrangements  music royalty fees and the delivery of other miscellaneous film materials to distributors 
fiscal year producer for hire and other revenue included approximately million of revenue from the completion of a producer for hire arrangement for a major hollywood studio 
we also recognized approximately million of revenue from the final delivery of films from another producer for hire arrangement that began production and delivery in fiscal year as discussed below 
fiscal year producer for hire and other revenue included approximately million of revenue from our completion of a producer for hire arrangement for a major hollywood studio 
we also recognized approximately million of revenue associated with the initial delivery of films from a second producer for hire arrangement 
we did not generate any producer for hire revenue in fiscal year cost of sales cost of sales is primarily comprised of the amortization of owned content film costs as well as delivery and distribution costs related to that content 
these expenses also include costs incurred to provide producer for hire services 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of sales was lower in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a million decline in film cost amortization from lower owned content revenue and from generating a larger proportion of revenue from higher margin films 
the decrease in cost of sales was partially offset by a million increase in production costs associated with producer for hire services 
the producer for hire services in fiscal year generated comparable revenue as the services rendered in fiscal year  however  the production costs associated with the fiscal year services were higher due to the production of a higher quality film 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue during fiscal year was as compared to during fiscal year the decline in the film cost amortization as a percentage of the owned content revenue was due to the above mentioned generation of a larger proportion of revenue from higher margin films during fiscal year cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to million of producer for hire costs associated with the completion of a producer for hire arrangement and the partial delivery of films related to a second producer for hire arrangement 
the increase in costs was partially offset by a decline in film cost amortization consistent with the decline in owned content revenue 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue during fiscal year was as compared to during fiscal year film cost amortization as a percentage of owned content revenue increased because the prior fiscal year included a larger proportion of revenue from older films whose costs had been fully amortized 
operating expenses and operating loss operating expenses during fiscal year included million in film cost impairment charges  which are discussed in more detail below 
operating expenses also included million in expenses to increase the allowance for unrecoverable accounts to reserve for certain recoupable costs and producer advances that are not expected to be recovered 
employee costs were higher in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year by approximately million primarily from severance expenses associated with the departure of certain employees  and consulting costs increased by approximately million from the provision of services related to strategic planning 
comparatively  the fiscal year results included a million goodwill impairment charge  million in film cost impairment charges  and million in charges to increase the allowance for unrecoverable accounts 
we may incur film cost impairment charges and charges to increase our allowance for unrecoverable accounts in the future if our content underperforms relative to our expectations 
the film production segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year operating expenses declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily because the fiscal year results included a million goodwill impairment charge and million in film cost impairment charges whereas the fiscal year results included a million goodwill impairment charge and million in film cost impairment charges 
these impairment charges are discussed in additional detail below 
operating expenses in fiscal year also included approximately million of expenses to increase the allowance for unrecoverable accounts because we estimated the amounts would not be recovered through future sales of the related repped content 
operating expenses declined in fiscal year by approximately million due to a reduction in tradeshow and travel costs associated with efforts to further reduce expenses in response to the economic downturn 
the film production segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill impairment charges we did not perform a goodwill impairment analysis for the film production segment as of march  because the segment goodwill was fully impaired in fiscal year as part of our prior fiscal year end procedures  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of march  we engaged an independent firm to assist us in performing the impairment test and considered the income and market valuation approaches in determining the estimated fair value of the film production segment 
using these methods  we determined that the estimated fair value of the film production segment was less than its carrying value as of march  we then performed additional analysis to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by first allocating the estimated fair value of the film production segment to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the operating segment 
the excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million to reduce the film production segment goodwill from million to the implied fair value of goodwill of zero 
although the fiscal year performance of the film production segment was consistent with our internal forecasts excluding the impact of impairment and related charges  conditions within the film markets continued to be challenging 
based on our historical and current experience within the film production markets and in connection with our year end annual goodwill impairment test  we modified our five year forecast for the film production segment downward to reflect our estimate that film market conditions would remain depressed and decline further 
as a result of our downward adjustment to the five year forecast  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  we determined that continued adverse changes in the business climate and material revisions to the film production segment internal three year forecasts based on lower than expected revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year were events that could indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
we therefore engaged an independent firm to assist us in performing an impairment test 
the income and market valuation approaches were considered in determining the estimated fair value of the film production segment 
using these methods  we determined that the estimated fair value of the film production segment was less than its carrying value at december  we then performed additional analysis to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal year of million to reduce the film production segment goodwill from million to the implied fair value of goodwill of million 
film cost impairment charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we recorded impairment expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with certain owned content films 
during our second quarter film performance analysis  we adjusted downward the expected performance for certain films based on a continuation of underperformance as compared to expectations 
during our fourth quarter film performance analysis  we adjusted downward the expected results for certain films based on a continued trend of lower than expected film performance and based on the recent departure of the segment co presidents 
as a result  we performed further assessments on the films and determined the fair value of the films was less than the unamortized cost of the films  and the differences were recorded as impairment charges 
the impairment charges were recorded in the charge for asset impairments other than goodwill within the film production segment 
the fair value of the 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued films was estimated by discounting the films expected future cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded impairment expenses of approximately million associated with several owned content films 
as part of our quarterly film performance analysis and in connection with our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we estimated that conditions within the film markets would continue to be challenging and adjusted downward the film production segment forecasts as well as certain estimated future film performance 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the related films 
this difference was recorded as a charge for asset impairments other than goodwill within the film production segment operating expenses 
the fair value of the films was estimated by discounting the film projected cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded impairment expenses of approximately million associated with several owned content films 
during that quarter and as part of our quarterly film performance analysis  we determined that downward adjustments to the estimated performance of the films should be recorded as a result of adverse changes to the business climate 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the films 
this difference was recorded as a charge for asset impairments other than goodwill within the film production segment operating expenses 
the fair value of the films was estimated by discounting the film projected cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital

the direct to consumer segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year other identifiable intangible assets impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that certain internally developed websites and related software used to manage our consumer websites no longer met our quality standards 
additionally  the software did not provide sufficient support or functionality for content management  database interface  consumer facing websites  or accumulation or reporting of website traffic 
as a result  we ceased using the websites and software  and we determined the websites and software would not provide us with service potential in the future 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million to reduce the fair value of the websites and related software to zero

other income expense and income tax benefit expense other income expense the following table sets forth certain financial information for other income expense for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs other income expense represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
amounts included in other income expense primarily relate to interest expense on our line of credit borrowings  interest expense on our uncertain tax positions  and interest income from our cash and cash equivalents 
the change in other income expense during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decline in interest expense on our line of credit borrowings 
interest expense declined as a result of the full year impact of reducing the related line of credit principal balance during the second half of fiscal year and from further reductions in the principal balance during fiscal year also contributing to the change was the reversal of interest expense in fiscal year associated with the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
there was no similar reversal of interest expense during fiscal year the change in other income expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily occurred because the fiscal year results included the reversal of approximately million of

discontinued operations the direct to consumer segment acquired certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box and other identifiable intangible assets in late fiscal year in an effort to expand the product lines that are delivered directly to consumers 
based primarily on a lower than expected subscriber additions for the iptv business model during the second half of fiscal year  b the significant downturn in economic conditions and related reduction in consumer spending during the second half of fiscal year  and c slower than expected development of new product lines  we restructured the direct to consumer segment operations as it related to new product lines 
in connection with the restructuring and an analysis of the future expected benefits from the operations  we determined that certain other identifiable intangible assets associated with the related new product lines were impaired and recorded million in other identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year additionally  several contracts were cancelled prior to the end of the related term in connection with the restructuring and as a result  we also incurred an early contract termination fee of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which was paid in april during fiscal year  we entered into arrangements with third party affiliates to distribute the iptv set top box in europe and the us throughout fiscal year  these affiliates marketed the iptv set top box product through a variety of advertising programs including print  billboards and other miscellaneous media 
the performance of the iptv set top box business in fiscal year was lower than expected and as a result  we implemented a plan to discontinue the operations of the iptv set top box business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we recorded inventory obsolescence impairment charges of million and equipment impairment charges of million

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily impacted by the following the decline in the operating income excluding the impact of goodwill  impairment and related charges primarily associated with the transactional tv segment performance  a million comparable decrease in cash flows from accounts receivable collections because fiscal year benefited from the collection of certain transactional tv and film production segment customer balances and similar collections did not recur in fiscal year  a million decrease in cash flows from the use of funds for the film production segment producer for hire services  and a million comparable increase in cash flows related to recoupable costs and producer advances because we generated a net recovery of these funds in fiscal year whereas the prior fiscal year reflected net cash outflows 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal year was significantly higher as compared to the operating loss incurred as a result of asset impairment and other charges 
cash from operating activities was also higher as compared to the operating loss incurred during fiscal year because we collected cash from the completion of an episodic series and from producer for hire services during fiscal year  but the production cash outflows from these arrangements occurred in the prior fiscal year

as of march   our outstanding principal balance under the line of credit was million  and we were in compliance with the related covenants 
historically  we have made borrowings under the line of credit to ensure we maintained a high level of liquidity through the economic downturn and to ensure the funds were available if needed 
although we borrowed funds under the line of credit to strengthen our liquidity  we have maintained cash and cash equivalent balances and generated positive cash flows from operations that are more than sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we do not currently have plans to make significant strategic investments  however  we believe the availability of funds through the line of credit provides us with additional flexibility when considering strategic investments

for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum services to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations to acquire specified quantities of movie license rights that are subject to the delivery of the related movies are included in vendor obligations because we estimate that the movies will be delivered in the specified time periods 
operating lease obligations also include estimated payments to landlords for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and related payments and are based on historical payments and estimated future payments 
interest payments include anticipated interest obligations on our million of outstanding principal from our line of credit and assume the amounts will remain outstanding through the remaining term of the line of credit  december   at an interest rate of 
we maintain non cancelable leases for office space and equipment under various operating leases 
the leases for office space expire through fiscal year our transactional tv segment has entered into direct lease agreements that expire through october with unrelated parties for the use of transponders to broadcast its channels on satellites 
we expect to have continued access to transponders subsequent to the expiration of the current leases 
in some instances  we are subject to arbitrary refusal of the transponder service by the service provider if that service provider determines that the content being transmitted by us is harmful to the service provider name or business 
any such service disruption would substantially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we also bear the risk that the access of their networks to transponders may be restricted or denied if a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions 
additionally  cable operators may be reluctant to carry less edited or partially edited adult programming on their systems 
if any of the above scenarios occurred  it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we had no equipment under capital lease as of march  or from time to time  we enter into arrangements with movie studios to acquire license rights for a fixed and or minimum quantity of movies over various purchase periods as defined by the agreements 
additionally  we are party to certain uplinking  transport and marketing services that contractually obligate us to receive services over specified terms as per these arrangements 
we are also obligated to make future payments associated with our purchase of patent rights 
these contractual obligations are reflected in the above table as vendor obligations 
we have recorded long term income taxes payable of million for uncertain tax positions  reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments  if any  related to these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  the amounts have been excluded from the above table
