item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis  as well as other sections in this report  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all references to years mean the relevant month period ended december overview general we are a technology based  specialty pharmaceutical company applying formulation and development expertise  as well as our drug delivery technology  to the development  manufacture and marketing of controlled release and niche generics  in addition to the development of branded products 
as of february   we marketed generic pharmaceuticals  which represent dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds through our own global pharmaceuticals division  another of our generic pharmaceuticals representing dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance and collaboration agreement partners 
we have applications pending at the fda  including tentatively approved by the fda  and other products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed 
in the generic pharmaceuticals market  we focus our efforts on controlled release generic versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals covering a broad range of therapeutic areas and having technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or limited competition 
we employ our technologies and formulation expertise to develop generic products that will reproduce the brand name product s physiological characteristics but not infringe any valid patents relating to the brand name product 
we generally focus on brand name products as to which the patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient have expired or are near expiration  and we employ our proprietary formulation expertise to develop controlled release technologies that do not infringe patents covering the brand name products controlled release technologies 
we are also developing specialty generic pharmaceuticals that we believe present one or more barriers to entry by competitors  such as difficulty in raw materials sourcing  complex formulation or development characteristics or special handling requirements 
in the brand name pharmaceuticals market  we are developing products for the treatment of central nervous system cns disorders 
our brand name product portfolio consists of development stage projects to which we are applying our formulation and development expertise to develop differentiated  modified  or controlled release versions of currently marketed either in the us or outside the us drug substances 
we intend to expand our brand name products portfolio primarily through internal development and also through licensing and acquisition 
we operate in two segments  referred to as the global pharmaceuticals division or global division and the impax pharmaceuticals division or impax division 

table of contents the global division develops  manufactures  sells  and distributes generic pharmaceutical products primarily through four sales channels the global products sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers  large retail drug chains  and others  the private label sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical over the counter otc and prescription products we sell to unrelated third party customers who in turn sell the product to third parties under their own label  the rx partner sales channel  for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance and collaboration agreements  and the otc partner sales channel  for sales of generic pharmaceutical otc products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance and collaboration agreements 
we sell our global division products within the continental united states of america and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
we have no sales in foreign countries 
we also generate revenue from research and development services provided under a joint development agreement with another pharmaceutical company  and report such revenue under the caption research partner revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
we provide theses services through the research and development group in our global division 
the impax division is engaged in the development of proprietary brand pharmaceutical products through improvements to already approved pharmaceutical products to address cns disorders 
the impax division is also engaged in the co promotion of products developed by unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities through our direct sales force focused on marketing to physicians referred to as physician detailing sales calls in the cns community 
we also generate revenue in the impax division from research and development services provided under a development and license agreement with an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company  and report such revenue under the caption research partner revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
we have entered into several alliance  collaboration or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future 
these agreements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on terms which ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us 
relationships with alliance and collaboration partners may also include risks due to the failure of a partner to perform under the agreement  incomplete marketplace information  inventories  development capabilities  regulatory compliance and commercial strategies of our partners and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes 
if we  or our partners  are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements  such commercial failure could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to a license and distribution agreement  we are dependent on an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company to supply us with our authorized generic of adderall xr  which we market and sell 
we experienced disruptions related to the supply of our authorized generic of adderall xr under the license and distribution agreement during the fiscal year ended december  in november  we filed suit against the third party supplier of our authorized generic of adderall xr for breach of contract and other related claims due to a failure to fill our orders as required by the license and distribution agreement 
in addition  we have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order seeking to require the third party supplier to fill product orders placed by us 
if we suffer supply disruptions related to our generic of adderall xr in the future  our revenues and relationships with our customers may be materially adversely affected 
further  we may enter into similar license and distribution agreements in the future 
any delay or interruption in the supply of product under such agreements could curtail or delay our product shipments and adversely affect our revenues  as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers 

table of contents impact of economic and regulatory conditions the global economy has undergone a period of significant volatility which has lead to diminished credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  and increases in unemployment rates 
there remains caution about the stability of the us economy due to the global financial crisis  and there can be no assurances further deterioration in the financial markets will not occur 
these economic conditions have resulted in  and could lead to further  reduced consumer spending related to healthcare in general and pharmaceutical products in particular 
in addition  we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  including our partners under our alliance and collaboration agreements  suppliers of raw chemical materials  drug wholesalers and other customers that may be affected by an unstable economic environment 
any economic instability may affect these parties ability to fulfill their respective contractual obligations to us or cause them to limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us which could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade 
there have been  and continue to be  new and proposed healthcare regulations  including the healthcare reform law  to reduce healthcare spending and contain costs 
certain reform initiatives may impose significant new regulations that limit prices on currently marketed products and future products currently under development  or require us to agree to provide product rebates on certain items to government payers  which may be significant 
these limitations could  in turn  reduce the amount of revenues we will be able to ultimately earn in the future from sales of our products and services 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and the rules and regulations of the us securities exchange commission sec require the use of estimates and assumptions  based on complex judgments considered reasonable  and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant judgments are employed in estimates used in determining values of tangible and intangible assets  legal contingencies  tax assets and tax liabilities  fair value of share based compensation related to equity incentive awards issued to employees and directors  and estimates used in applying the company s revenue recognition policy including those related to accrued chargebacks  rebates  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and the timing and amount of deferred and recognized revenue and deferred and amortized manufacturing costs under the company s several alliance and collaboration agreements 
actual results may differ from estimated results 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable when made  they are based upon information available to us at the time they are made 
we periodically review the factors having an influence on our estimates and  if necessary  adjust such estimates 
although historically our estimates have generally been reasonably accurate  due to the risks and uncertainties involved in our business and evolving market conditions  and given the subjective element of the estimates made  actual results may differ from estimated results 
this possibility may be greater than normal during times of pronounced economic volatility 
global product sales  net 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic  revenue recognition sab 
revenue from direct product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers 
accrued provisions for estimated chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other pricing adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded 
consistent with industry practice  we record an accrued provision for estimated deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments  in the same period when revenue is recognized 
the objective of recording provisions for such deductions at the time of sale is to provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate amount we expect to ultimately credit our customers 
since arrangements giving rise to the various sales credits are typically time driven ie particular promotions entitling customers who make purchases of our products during a specific period of time  to certain levels of rebates or chargebacks  these deductions represent important reductions of the amounts those customers would otherwise owe us for their purchases of those products 
customers typically process their claims for deductions in a reasonably timely manner  usually within the established payment terms 
we monitor actual credit memos issued to our customers and compare such actual amounts to the estimated provisions  in the aggregate  for each deduction category to assess the reasonableness of the various reserves at each quarterly balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated provisions and actual credits issued have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate in accordance with gaap 
we do not have the ability to specifically link any particular sales credit to an exact sales transaction and since there have been no material differences  we believe our systems and procedures are adequate for managing our business 
an event such as the failure to report a particular promotion could result in a significant difference between the estimated amount accrued and the actual amount claimed by the customer  and  while there have been none to date  we would evaluate the particular events and factors giving rise to any such significant difference in determining the appropriate accounting 

table of contents chargebacks 
we have agreements establishing contract prices for certain products with certain indirect customers  such as managed care organizations  hospitals  and government agencies who purchase our products from drug wholesalers 
the contract prices are lower than the prices the customer would otherwise pay to the wholesaler  and the difference is referred to as a chargeback  which generally takes the form of a credit issued by us to reduce the gross sales amount we invoiced to our wholesaler customer 
an accrued provision for chargeback deductions is estimated and recorded at the time we ship the products to our wholesaler customers 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the accrued provision for chargebacks are the average historical chargeback credits given  the mix of products shipped  and the amount of inventory on hand at the three major drug wholesalers with whom we do business 
we monitor aggregate actual chargebacks granted and compare them to the estimated accrued provision for chargebacks to assess the reasonableness of the chargeback reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the chargeback reserve for the years ended december   and as of december  chargeback reserve in s beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the decrease in the provision for estimated chargebacks as a percent of gross global product sales from to was principally the result of the launch of our tamsulosin product and our authorized generic adderall xr products  both of which generally resulted in higher gross global product sales and carried a lower average chargeback credit amount  relative to our other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  resulting in a lower overall aggregate average chargebacks as a percentage of gross global product sales during the year ended december  we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on march  and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight weeks  during which we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
our tamsulosin product sales after the end of the contractual exclusivity period  have not remained at this level  as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april  and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share 
see results of operations below for additional discussion 
the decrease in the provision for chargebacks as a percent of global product sales  gross from to was principally the result of the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products during the quarter ended december   which generally carried a lower level of chargebacks than other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  and resulted in a reduced overall aggregate chargeback rate during 
table of contents rebates 
in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty  we maintain various rebate programs with our customers to whom we market our products through our global division global products sales channel 
the rebates generally take the form of a credit memo to reduce the invoiced gross sales amount charged to a customer for products shipped 
an accrued provision for rebate deductions is estimated and recorded at the time of product shipment 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the provision for rebates are the average historical experience of aggregate credits issued  the mix of products shipped and the historical relationship of rebates as a percentage of total global product sales  gross  the contract terms and conditions of the various rebate programs in effect at the time of shipment  and the amount of inventory on hand at the three major drug wholesalers with which we do business 
we also monitor aggregate actual rebates granted and compare them to the estimated aggregate provision for rebates to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate rebate reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the rebate reserve for the years december   and as of december  rebate reserve in s beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the decrease in the provision for estimated rebates as a percent of gross global product sales from to was principally the result of our tamsulosin product and our authorized generic adderall xr products  both of which resulted in higher gross global product sales 
our tamsulosin product carried a lower rebate credit amount  relative to our other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  resulting in a lower overall aggregate average rebate as a percentage of gross global product sales during the twelve months ended december  additionally  average rebates provided for as a percentage on sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products were lower during the twelve months ended december  we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on march  and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight weeks  during which we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
following the expiration of our contractual exclusivity period  our tamsulosin product sales have decreased as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april  and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the affect of tamsulosin and our authorized generic of adderall xr product sales on our financial condition 
the increase in the provision for rebates as a percent of global product sales  gross from to was principally the result of the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products during the fourth quarter ended december   which generally carried a higher level of rebates than other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  and resulted in a higher overall aggregate rebate rate during 
table of contents returns 
we allow our customers to return product i if approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii if such products are returned within six months prior to  or until twelve months following  the products expiration date 
we estimate a provision for product returns as a percentage of gross sales based upon historical experience of global division global product sales 
the product return reserve is estimated using a historical lag period  which is the time between when the product is sold and when it is ultimately returned  and return rates  adjusted by estimates of the future return rates based on various assumptions  which may include changes to internal policies and procedures  changes in business practices  and commercial terms with customers  competitive position of each product  amount of inventory in the wholesaler supply chain  the introduction of new products and changes in market sales information 
we also consider other factors  including significant market changes which may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns 
we monitor aggregate actual product returns on a quarterly basis and we may record specific provisions for product returns we believe are not covered by historical percentages 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the accrued product returns for the years ended december   and as of december  returns reserve in s beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the provision for returns as a percent of global product sales  gross has declined steadily during the three year period ended december  primarily as the result of continued improvement in our historical experience of actual return credits processed 
our historical experience for returns has improved due to the launch of new products in recent years  for example our tamsulosin product and our authorized generic adderall xr products 
in addition  sales of generic drug products which are not bioequivalent sometimes referred to as non ab rated to the associated brand drug  declined significantly as a percent of total gross global product sales from to  and continued to make up a small portion of our global product sales during the year ended december  sales of our non ab rated drugs as a percent of total gross global product sales were approximately  and  during the years ended december    and  respectively  as a result of our decision to begin to discontinue the sale of non ab rated products  thereby having less impact on the overall returns percentage in  and continuing through and 
table of contents medicaid 
as required by law  we provide a rebate payment on drugs dispensed under the medicaid program 
we determine our estimate of the accrued medicaid rebate reserve primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program which may impact our estimate of medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider historical payment rates and processing lag for outstanding claims and payments 
we record estimates for medicaid payments as a deduction from gross sales  with corresponding adjustments to accrued liabilities 
the accrual for medicaid payments totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the accrual for medicaid rebate payments increased significantly beginning in as a result of the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products in october  as such medicaid rebate payments are calculated under the regulations applicable to brand products 
shelf stock adjustments 
based upon competitive market conditions  we may reduce the selling price of certain products 
we may issue a credit against the sales amount to a customer based upon their remaining inventory of the product in question  provided the customer agrees to continue to make future purchases of product from the company 

this type of customer credit is referred to as a shelf stock adjustment  which is the difference between the sales price and the revised lower sales price  multiplied by an estimate of the number of product units on hand at a given date 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us in response to market conditions  including estimated launch dates of competing products and estimated declines in market price 
the accrued reserve for shelf stock adjustments totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
historically  differences between our estimated and actual credits issued for shelf stock adjustments have not been significant 
allowance for uncollectible amounts 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible amounts for estimated losses resulting from amounts deemed to be uncollectible from our customers  these allowances are for specific amounts on certain accounts 
the allowance for uncollectible amounts totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
private label sales 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sab revenue from direct product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers 
revenue received from private label product sales are generally not subject to deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other pricing adjustments 
additionally  private label product sales do not have upfront  milestone  or lump sum payments and do not contain multiple deliverables under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification tm asc or the codification topic 
table of contents rx partner and otc partner 
each of our alliance and collaboration agreements involves multiple deliverables in the form of products  services and or licenses over extended periods 
fasb asc topic supplemented sab for accounting for such multiple element revenue arrangements 
with respect to our multiple element revenue arrangements  we determine whether any or all of the elements of the arrangement should be separated into individual units of accounting under fasb asc topic if separation into individual units of accounting is appropriate  we recognize revenue for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria specified by sab are achieved for the deliverable 
if separation is not appropriate  we recognize revenue and related direct manufacturing costs over the estimated life of the agreement or the company s estimated expected period of performance using either the straight line method or a modified proportional performance method 
under the modified proportional performance method  the amount recognized in the period of initial recognition is based upon the number of years elapsed under the agreement relative to the estimated total recognition period of the particular agreement 
the amount of revenue recognized in the year of initial recognition is thus determined by multiplying the total amount realized by a fraction  the numerator of which is the then current year of the agreement and the denominator of which is the total number of years estimated to be the recognition period 
the remaining balance of the amount realized is then recognized in equal amounts in each of the succeeding years of the recognition period 
thus  for example  with respect to profit share or royalty payments reported by an alliance and collaboration agreement partner during the third year of an agreement with an estimated recognition period of years  of the amount reported is recognized in the year reported and of the amount is recognized during each of the remaining years 
a fuller description of our analysis under fasb asc topic and the modified proportional performance method is set forth in item exhibits and financial statement schedules note to consolidated financial statements 
we applied the updated guidance of asc  multiple element arrangements  to the strategic alliance agreement with teva pharmaceuticals curacao nv  a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva agreement during the year ended december  see item exhibits and financial statement schedules note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the application of the updated guidance to the teva agreement 
rx partner revenue is related to the teva agreement 
all consideration received under the teva agreement is contingent  and therefore can not be allocated to the deliverables 
we look to the underlying delivery of goods and or services which give rise to the payment of consideration under the teva agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
consideration received as a result of research and development related activities performed under the teva agreement are initially deferred and recorded as a liability captioned deferred revenue alliance agreements 
we recognize the deferred revenue on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance of such services 
consideration received as a result of the manufacture and delivery of products under the teva agreement is recognized at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer generally when product is received by teva 
we recognize profit share as current period revenue when earned 
otc partner revenue is related to our alliance and collaboration agreements with merck co  inc formerly schering plough corporation and pfizer inc formerly wyeth with respect to supply of over the counter pharmaceutical products and related research and development services 
we initially defer all revenue earned under our otc partner alliance and collaboration agreements 
the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability captioned deferred revenue alliance and collaboration agreements 
we also defer direct product manufacturing costs to the extent such costs are reimbursable by the otc partners 
these deferred product manufacturing costs are recorded as an asset captioned deferred product manufacturing costs alliance and collaboration agreements 
the product manufacturing costs in excess of amounts reimbursable by the otc partners are recognized as current period cost of revenue 
we recognize revenue as otc partner revenue and amortize deferred product manufacturing costs as cost of revenues as we fulfill our contractual obligations 
revenue is recognized and associated costs are amortized over the respective alliance and collaboration agreements term of the arrangement or our expected period of performance  using a modified proportional performance method 
under the modified proportional performance method of revenue recognition utilized by us  the amount recognized in the period of initial recognition is based upon the number of years elapsed under the respective alliance and collaboration agreement relative to the estimated total length of the recognition period 
under this method  the amount of revenue recognized in the year of initial recognition is determined by multiplying the total amount realized by a fraction  the numerator of which is the then current year of the alliance and collaboration agreement and the denominator of which is the total estimated life of the alliance and collaboration agreement 
the amount recognized during each remaining year is an equal pro rata amount 
finally  cumulative revenue recognized is limited to the extent of cash collected and or the fair value received 
the result of the modified proportional performance method is a greater portion of the revenue is recognized in the initial period with the remaining balance being recognized ratably over either the remaining life of the arrangement or the expected period of performance of each respective alliance agreement 

table of contents as noted above  our alliance and collaboration agreements obligate us to deliver multiple goods and or services over extended periods 
such deliverables include manufactured pharmaceutical products  exclusive and semi exclusive marketing rights  distribution licenses  and research and development services 
in exchange for these deliverables  we receive payments from our alliance and collaboration agreement partners for product shipments  and may also receive royalty  profit sharing  and or upfront or periodic milestone payments 
revenue received from the alliance and collaboration agreement partners for product shipments under these agreements is generally not subject to deductions for chargebacks  rebates  returns  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments 
royalty and profit sharing amounts we receive under these agreements are calculated by the respective alliance and collaboration agreement partner  with such royalty and profit share amounts generally based upon estimates of net product sales or gross profit which include estimates of deductions for chargebacks  rebates  returns  shelf stock adjustments and other adjustments the alliance agreement partners may negotiate with their customers 
we record the alliance and collaboration agreement partner s adjustments to such estimated amounts in the period the alliance and collaboration agreement partner reports the amounts to us 
research partner 
we have entered into development agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies under which we are collaborating in the development of five dermatological products  including four generic products and one branded dermatological product  and one branded cns product 
under each of the development agreements  we received an upfront fee with the potential to receive additional milestone payments upon completion of contractually specified clinical and regulatory milestones 
additionally  we may also receive royalty payments from the sale  if any  of a successfully developed and commercialized branded product under one of the development agreements 
revenue received from the provision of research and development services  including the upfront payment and the contingent milestone payments  if any  will be deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of performance of the research and development services 
royalty fee income  if any  will be recognized by us as current period revenue when earned 
promotional partner 
we have entered into promotional services agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies under which we provide physician detailing sales calls services to promote certain of those companies branded drug products 
we receive service fee revenue in exchange for providing this service 
we recognize revenue from the provision of physician detailing sales calls as such services are rendered and the performance obligations are met and from contingent payments  if any  at the time they are earned 

table of contents estimated lives of alliance and collaboration agreements 
the revenue we receive under our alliance and collaboration agreements is not subject to adjustment for estimated chargebacks  rebates  product returns and other pricing adjustments as such adjustments are included in the amounts we receive from our partners 
however  because we recognize revenue we receive under our alliance and collaboration agreements  which is required to be deferred  over the estimated life of the related agreement or our expected performance utilizing either the straight line method or a modified proportional performance method  we are required to estimate the recognition period under each such agreement in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period 
sometimes this estimate is based solely on the fixed term of the particular alliance and collaboration agreement 
in other cases the estimate may be based on more subjective factors as noted in the following paragraphs 
while changes to the estimated recognition periods have been infrequent  such changes  should they occur  may have a significant impact on our financial statements 
as an illustration  with the application of the updated accounting principles promulgated by fasb asc  to the teva agreement beginning in the quarter ended september   our estimated expected period of performance to provide research and development services under the teva agreement is now estimated to be a month period  starting in july following the june effective date of the teva agreement  and through to and including october with the estimated date of fda approval of the final product covered by the teva agreement 
the fda approval of the final product under the teva agreement represents the end of our expected period of performance as we will have no further contractual obligation to perform research and development services under the teva agreement and  therefore  the earnings process for consideration received from the provision of research and development services will be complete 
in accordance with our accounting policy  the change in the recognition period for the teva agreement was applied prospectively  as an adjustment in the period of change in the quarter ended september  if we determine our estimated timing of fda approval of the final product under the teva agreement requires further adjustment  we would adjust the recognition period under the teva agreement on a prospective basis  resulting in a change to the periodic revenue recognized under the teva agreement 
for additional information on the accounting afforded the teva agreement  see item exhibits and financial statement schedules note to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  for example  our expected period of performance to provide research and development services under our joint development agreement with medicis is estimated to be a month period  starting in december when the performance of the contractual services commenced and ending in november upon fda approval of the fifth and final submission 
the fda approval of the final submission under the joint development agreement represents the end of our estimated expected period of performance  as we will have no further contractual obligation to perform research and development services under the joint development agreement  and therefore the earnings process will be complete 
if the timing of fda approval for the final submission under the joint development agreement is different from our estimate  the revenue recognition period will change on a prospective basis at the time such event occurs 
while no such change in the estimated life of the joint development agreement has occurred to date  if we were to conclude significantly more time will be required to obtain fda approval  then we would increase our estimate of the revenue recognition period under the joint development agreement  resulting in reduced revenue recognition and related amortized costs  if any in current and future periods 
additionally  we estimate our expected period of performance to provide research and development services under our development and co promotion agreement with endo pharmaceuticals  inc endo agreement is months commencing in june when the performance of the contractual services commenced and ending in december the estimated date of fda approval of the product to be developed under the endo agreement 
the fda approval of the product which is the subject of the endo agreement represents the end of our expected period of performance  as we will have no further contractual obligation to perform research and development activities under the endo agreement  and therefore the earnings process will be completed 
if the timing of fda approval for the final submission under the endo agreement is different from our estimate  the revenue recognition period will change on a prospective basis at the time such event occurs 
while no such change in the estimated life of the endo agreement has occurred to date  if we were to conclude that significantly more time will be required to obtain fda approval of the product to be developed under the endo agreement  then we would increase our estimate of the recognition period under the agreement  resulting in a lesser amount of revenue and related costs in current and future periods 

table of contents third party research agreements 
in addition to our own research and development resources  we may use unrelated third party vendors  including universities and independent research companies  to assist in our research and development activities 
these vendors provide a range of research and development services to us  including clinical and bio equivalency studies 
we generally sign agreements with these vendors which establish the terms of each study performed by them  including  among other things  the technical specifications of the study  the payment schedule  and timing of work to be performed 
payments are generally earned by third party researchers either upon the achievement of a milestone  or on a pre determined date  as specified in each study agreement 
we account for third party research and development expenses as they are incurred according to the terms and conditions of the respective agreement for each study performed  with an accrued expense at each balance sheet date for estimated fees and charges incurred by us  but not yet billed to us 
we monitor aggregate actual payments and compare them to the estimated provisions to assess the reasonableness of the accrued expense balance at each quarterly balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated and actual payments made have not been significant 
share based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of each option and restricted share over its vesting period 
options and restricted shares granted under the plan vest over a three or four year period and have a term of ten years 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model  wherein expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock  and of a peer group for the period of time our common stock was deregistered as described in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  over the period commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the expected term calculation is based on the simplified method described in sab no 
 share based payment and sab no 
 share based payment  as the simplified method provides a reasonable estimate in comparison to our actual experience 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for an instrument with a maturity that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield is zero as we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 

table of contents income taxes 
we are subject to us federal  state and local income taxes and taiwan roc income taxes 
we create a deferred tax asset  or a deferred tax liability  when we have temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values gaap and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
fair value of financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents include a portfolio of high quality credit securities  including us government sponsored entity securities  treasury bills  corporate bonds  short term commercial paper  and or high rated money market funds 
our entire portfolio matures in less than one year 
the carrying value of the portfolio approximated the market value at december  our deferred compensation liability is carried at fair value  based upon observable market values 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  our only remaining debt instrument at december  was the wells fargo credit facility  which would be subject to variable interest rates and principal payments should we decide to borrow against it 
contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to loss contingencies  such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business  covering a wide range of matters  including  among others  patent litigation  shareholder lawsuits  and product and clinical trial liability 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  we record accrued loss contingencies when it is probable a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and we do not recognize gain contingencies until realized 

table of contents goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill and other intangibles  rather than recording periodic amortization of goodwill  goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under fasb asc topic  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  then goodwill is considered not impaired  making further analysis not required 
we consider each of our global division and impax division operating segments to be a reporting unit  as this is the lowest level for each of which discrete financial information is available 
we attribute the entire carrying amount of goodwill to the global division 
we concluded the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  and  as the fair value of the global division exceeded its carrying value at each date 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
we estimate the fair value of the global division using a discounted cash flow model for both the reporting unit and the enterprise  as well as earnings and revenue multiples per common share outstanding for enterprise fair value 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business operations to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  and thus indicate a potential impairment of the goodwill carrying value

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities  and more recently  with cash from operations 
currently  our principal source of liquidity is cash from operations  consisting of the proceeds from the sales of our products and provision of services 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses  including research and development activities and patent litigation expenses  for the foreseeable future 
we estimate research and development expenses will be approximately million and patent litigation expenses will be approximately million for the next months 
we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of approximately million during the next months  principally for continued improvements and expansion of our research and development and manufacturing facilities in the state of california  our packaging and distribution facilities in the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and our facility in jhunan taiwan in addition  we are generally required to make cash expenditures to manufacture and or acquire finished product inventory in advance of selling the finished product to our customers and collecting payment for such product sales  which may result in significant periodic uses of cash 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  and our bank revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our financing requirements through the next months 
we may  however  seek additional financing through alliance  collaboration  and or licensing agreements  as well as from the equity and or debt capital markets to fund the planned capital expenditures  our research and development plans  potential acquisitions  and potential revenue shortfalls due to delays in new product introductions

the decrease in accounts receivable to million at december   resulted in a million source of cash  compared to the same period in the prior year when accounts receivable resulted in a million use of cash flows 
the higher level of prepaid and other assets resulted in a million use of cash in the current year  compared to a million source of cash in the prior year  while lower accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted in a year over year decrease of million in cash flows 
the decreased level of accounts receivable at december  was primarily the result of amounts owed by our customers related to sales from the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products launched in october 
cash provided by operating activities during the current year was also positively impacted by sales from the launch of our tamsulosin product in march  of which we commenced sales with a contractual eight week exclusivity period starting on march   during which time we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
tamsulosin product sales after the contractual exclusivity period noted above did not remain at this level  as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april at the conclusion of our contractual exclusivity period

 milestone method of revenue recognition topic 
this update addresses accounting for arrangements in which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations over time  with all or a portion of the consideration contingent on future events  referred to as milestones 
the milestone method of revenue recognition is limited to arrangements which involve research or development activities 
a milestone is defined as an event for which  at the date the arrangement is entered into  there is substantive uncertainty whether the event will be achieved  and the achievement of the event is based in whole or in part on either the vendor s performance or a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance 
in addition  the achievement of the event would result in additional payments being due to the vendor 
the milestone method of revenue recognition allows a vendor to adopt an accounting policy to recognize arrangement consideration that is contingent on the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period the milestone is achieved 
the milestone method of revenue recognition is effective on a prospective basis  with an option for retrospective application  for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
if an entity elects early application in a period that is not the first reporting period of its fiscal year  then the guidance must be applied retrospectively from the beginning of that fiscal year
