item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the caption risk factors in this annual report 
overview background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in licensing  development and commercialization of proprietary branded products and late stage product candidates to treat important medical conditions where there is an unmet medical need and or high level of patient dissatisfaction  currently in the central nervous system therapeutic area 
in march  the fda approved our nda for silenor mg and mg tablets for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance 
silenor was made commercially available by prescription in the united states in september our principal focus is on commercial activities relating to silenor 
we have increased our headcount from employees as of march to employees as of february  we commercially launched silenor in september with sales representatives provided to us on an exclusive basis under our contract sales agreement with publicis  and an additional sales representatives provided to us under our co promotion agreement with p g 
in february  we engaged publicis to provide us with an additional sales representatives 
as a result  we believe that as of the early second quarter of silenor will be supported by sales representatives  all of whom will promote silenor in the primary detail position 
we have also established the manufacturing and distribution channel for silenor through agreements with third party suppliers and service providers  and we have established reimbursement coverage for silenor with numerous private and government payors 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product is recognized at the time of sale only if our price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid us  or the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by us  we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents we sell silenor to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
our returned goods policy generally permits our customers to return products up to six months before and up to twelve months after the expiration date of the product 
we authorize returns for expired or damaged products in accordance with our returned goods policy and issue credit to our customers for expired or damaged returned product 
we do not exchange product from inventory for returned product 
as of december   we have not received any returns 
we are unable to reliably estimate returns at this time 
therefore  we have determined that shipment of product to wholesale distributors does not meet the criteria for revenue recognition at the time of shipment 
until we are able to reliably estimate returns  we will defer revenue recognition until the right of return no longer exists  which is the earlier of silenor being dispensed through patient prescriptions or the expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information 
for the year ended december   we recognized product revenue of million  which was net of estimated product sales discounts and allowances 
at december   we had a deferred revenue balance of million which was also recorded net of estimated product sales discounts and allowances 
we have also deferred the related cost of product sales and recorded such amount as finished goods inventory held by others  which was million as of december  until we can reliably estimate product returns  we will continue to recognize revenue upon the earlier to occur of prescription units dispensed or the expiration of the right of return 
in order to develop a methodology and provide a basis for estimating future product returns on sales to customers at the time of product shipment  we are analyzing many factors  including industry data of product return rates  and tracking the silenor product return history  taking into account product expiration dating at the time of shipment and levels of inventory in the wholesale channel 
we may use some or all of these factors in establishing a basis for estimating future product returns on sales to customers at the time of product shipment 
product sales discounts and allowances we record product sales discounts and allowances at the time of sale and report revenue net of such amounts in the same period that product sales are recorded 
in determining the amount of product sales discounts and allowances  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
if actual results vary from our estimates  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product revenue in the period of adjustment 
our product sales discounts and allowances and the specific considerations we use in estimating these amounts include prompt pay discounts 
as an incentive for prompt payment  we offer a cash discount to customers 
we expect that all customers will comply with the contractual terms to earn the discount 
we recorded the discount as an allowance against accounts receivable and a reduction of revenue 
at december  and  the allowance for prompt pay discounts was  and  respectively 
product launch discounts 
for a limited time that ended september   we offered additional discounts to wholesale distributors for product purchased 
we recorded the discount as an allowance against accounts receivable and a reduction of revenue based on orders placed 
at december  and  the allowance for product launch discounts was  and  respectively 
patient discount programs 
we offer discount card programs to patients who are prescribed silenor under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription 
we reimburse pharmacies for this discount through a third party vendor 
we estimate the total amount that will be redeemed based on the dollar amount of the discount  the timing and quantity of distribution and historical redemption rates 
we accrued the discount and recognized a reduction of revenue 
at december  and  the accrual for patient discount programs was  and  respectively 
distribution service fees 
we pay distribution service fees to each wholesaler for distribution and inventory management services 
we accrued for the fees based on contractually defined terms with each wholesaler and recognized a reduction of revenue 
at december  and  the accrual for distribution service fees was  and  respectively 

table of contents chargebacks 
we provide discounts to federal government qualified entities with whom we have contracted 
these federal entities purchase products from the wholesalers at a discounted price  and the wholesalers then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the contracted price the federal entity paid for the product 
we accrued chargebacks based on contract prices and sell through sales data obtained from third party information 
at december  and  the accrual for chargebacks was  and  respectively 
rebates 
we participate in certain rebate programs  which provide discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients 
under these rebate programs  we pay a rebate to the third party administrator of the program 
we accrued rebates based on contract prices  estimated percentages of product sold to qualified patients and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
at december  and  the accrual for rebates was  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the activity for the year ended december  associated with product sales discounts and allowances  with amounts shown in thousands 
there was no activity in for product sales discounts and allowances 
total accrued prompt product patient charge sales pay launch discount distribution backs and discounts discounts discounts fees service fees rebates and allowances balance at january  provision made for sales during period payments balance at december  for a limited time that ended september   we offered stocking allowances on the first order made by wholesale distributors and retail pharmacies 
as of december   we had no remaining obligations for stocking allowances 
cost of sales cost of sales include the costs to manufacture  package  and ship silenor  including personnel costs associated with manufacturing oversight  as well as royalties associated with our license agreement with procom 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on a fifo basis  or net realizable value 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  as well as any inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
we did not record a reserve for expired inventory as of december  capitalized license fees license fees related to our intellectual property are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred to in license our product candidates subsequent to fda approval of our nda for silenor have been capitalized and recorded as an intangible asset 
capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected life of the intellectual property commencing with the commercial launch of the related product 
determining when technological feasibility has been achieved  and determining the related amortization period for capitalized intellectual property  requires the use of estimates and subjective judgment 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation expense for employees and directors is recognized in the statement of operations based on estimated amounts  including the grant date fair value  the probability of achieving performance conditions and the expected service period for awards with conditional vesting provisions 
for stock options  we estimate the grant date fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires the use of multiple subjective inputs including an estimate of future volatility  expected forfeitures and the expected term of the awards 
our stock did not have a readily available market prior to our initial public offering in december  creating a relatively short history from which to obtain data to estimate volatility for our stock price 
consequently  we estimate our expected future volatility based on a combination of both comparable companies and our own stock price volatility to the extent such history is available 
our future volatility may differ from our estimated volatility at the grant date 
we estimate the expected term of our options using guidance provided by the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
and sab no 
this guidance provides a formula driven approach for determining the expected term 
share based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
estimated forfeitures are adjusted to actual amounts as they become known 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods 
the requisite service period is generally the time over which our share based awards vest 
some of our share based awards vested upon achieving certain performance conditions  generally pertaining to approval of the silenor nda by the fda  the commercial launch of silenor  or the achievement of other strategic objectives 
share based compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition are determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  then no expense is recognized until such time the performance condition is considered probable of being met 
at that time  expense is recognized over the period during which the performance condition is likely to be achieved 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our stock options realized upon exercise could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
income taxes our income tax expense consists of current and deferred income tax expense or benefit 
current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to tax credits and loss carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we have established a valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets 
tax rate changes are reflected in income during the period such changes are enacted 
changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in the future to offset taxable income 
in addition  the state of california has currently suspended the use of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income

personnel and other costs silenor development work share based compensation total research and development expense research and development expense decreased million for compared to primarily due to lower development expenses and share based compensation expense 
silenor development expenses decreased because of the lower level of activity relating to both the nda and non clinical studies during as compared to share based compensation was lower in as included the additional cost of our one time stock option exchange program that was completed in june and the impact of accelerated option vesting arrangements under severance related agreements 
research and development expense decreased million for compared to primarily due to a decrease in drug development activities for silenor as a result of the completion during of our cardiac study for silenor and the delay in the fda approval process for silenor 
offsetting these reductions in expense was a payment to our silenor packaging supplier for purchase authorizations for certain expired raw materials 
personnel and other costs decreased as a result of a reduction in headcount  which occurred as part of our cost reduction measures 
this reduction in headcount also caused a decrease in share based compensation expense  but this decrease was partially offset by accelerated vesting and continued vesting under consulting arrangements for certain employees whose employment was terminated 
the consulting arrangements were considered non substantive for accounting purposes  and the full value of the awards expected to vest over the consulting arrangement was expensed at the time employment was terminated 
the decrease in share based compensation expense was further offset by share based compensation expense incurred in conjunction with our one time stock option exchange program in june we expect our research and development expenses to decrease in over levels as we focus on commercial activities relating to silenor 
we are unable to estimate with certainty our future research and development expenses in part because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will potentially pursue the development of other product candidates  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  representing an increase of million from december  the increase was due to two public offerings of our common stock we conducted in in march  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in marketable securities 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
all of our investments in marketable securities and money market funds continue to be highly rated  highly liquid and have readily determinable fair values 
as a result  none of our securities are considered to be impaired 

table of contents we expect to continue to incur losses and have negative cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future as we continue our commercial activities for silenor  commercialize any other products to which we obtain rights and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funds to finance our operations in the future 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we intend to obtain any additional funding we require through strategic relationships  public or private equity or debt financings  assigning receivables or royalty rights  or other arrangements and we cannot assure such funding will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the first quarter of the actual period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations could vary based upon many factors  including but not limited to the rate of growth of silenor sales and the actual cost of commercial activities 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following our success in generating cash flows from the commercialization of silenor  together with our co promotion partner p g  the costs of establishing or contracting for commercial programs and resources  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses  the rate of progress and cost of our non clinical studies  clinical trials and other development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of development programs we pursue  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing when needed 
if available  financing may not be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unsuccessful in raising sufficient additional funds  our growth plans and our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted  and we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate plans or programs relating to our business  relinquish some or all of our rights to silenor  renegotiate less favorable terms with respect to such rights than we would otherwise choose or cease operating as a going concern 
if we are unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements  and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
we have two effective shelf registration statements on form s filed with the sec under which we may offer from time to time up to an aggregate of approximately million in any combination of debt securities  common and preferred stock and warrants 
these registration statements could allow us to seek additional financing  subject to the sec s rules and regulations relating to eligibility to use form s as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected 
concern about the stability of the markets in general and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

table of contents in march  the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act  which makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states 
this act includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies  some of which are effective immediately and others of which will be taking effect over the next several years 
for example  the act seeks to expand health care coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of medicaid 
the act will also impose substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers  such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to medicaid  new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the medicare prescription drug benefit  an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the united states  and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics 
the act also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for health care items and services generally  including pharmaceuticals 
it also will require reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals 
these measures could result in decreased potential returns from our pharmaceutical products and any development efforts

table of contents litigation on november   we received a notice from each of actavis elizabeth llc and mylan pharmaceuticals inc that each had filed with the fda an anda for a generic version of silenor mg and mg tablets 
each of the notices included a paragraph iv certification with respect to seven of the eight patents listed in the orange book for silenor 
on december   we  together with procom  filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against each of actavis and mylan 
the lawsuit alleges that actavis and mylan have each infringed us patent no 
 by filing their andas relating to silenor prior to the expiration of this patent 
pursuant to the provisions of the hatch waxman act  fda final approval of each of the actavis and mylan andas can occur no earlier than may   unless there is an earlier court decision that the patent is not infringed and or invalid or unless any party to the action is found to have failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the infringement action 
at this time  other patents listed in the orange book for silenor have not been asserted against either mylan or actavis 
on december   we received a notice from par pharmaceuticals  inc that it had filed with the fda an anda for a generic version of silenor mg and mg tablets 
this notice included a paragraph iv certification with respect to seven of the eight patents listed in the orange book for silenor 
on february   we  together with procom  filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against par 
the lawsuit alleges that par has infringed us patent no 
 by filing its anda relating to silenor prior to the expiration of this patent 
pursuant to the provisions of the hatch waxman act  fda final approval of the par anda can occur no earlier than june   unless there is an earlier court decision that the patent is not infringed and or invalid or unless any party to the action is found to have failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the infringement action 
at this time  other patents listed in the orange book for silenor have not been asserted against par 
we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to silenor  but we cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
the prosecution of the lawsuits against actavis  mylan and par will increase our cash expenditures 
any adverse outcome in this litigation could result in one or more generic versions of silenor being launched before the expiration of the listed patents  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to increase sales of silenor and would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations  including causing a significant decrease in our revenues and cash flows 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period through through after total non cancellable purchase orders other contractual obligations operating lease obligations total we entered into a license agreement with procom to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize silenor 
pursuant to this agreement  we obtained exclusive  sub licensable rights to the patents and know how for certain indications 
this license agreement required us to pay an upfront payment as well as additional payments upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory approval milestones 
we are also obligated to pay royalties under the agreement until the expiration of the applicable patents 
royalty payments due under the terms of the in license agreement are recorded as an accrued liability as of december  the royalty payments will be recognized as an expense when the related shipment is recognized as revenue 
future royalty payments are not included in the table above because we cannot reasonably estimate them at this time 
in july  we entered into a professional detailing services agreement with publicis  under which publicis has agreed to provide sales support to promote silenor in the us through full time sales representatives  one regional field coordinator and one national business director  all of whom will be employees of publicis 
in february we entered into an amendment with publicis  under which publicis has agreed to provide sales support to promote silenor in the us through an additional full time sales representatives and one additional regional field coordinator  all of whom will be employees of publicis 
prior to the first anniversary of the deployment of publicis initial sales representatives  we have the right to terminate the services agreement upon days written notice and payment to publicis of a termination fee in a specified amount 
we have estimated this specified amount as of december  and included this amount in the table above 
in august  we entered into a co promotion agreement with p g  under which p g will provide sales support to promote silenor in the us through its team of full time sales representatives 
beginning in january  p g will also provide certain managed care support services 
we will recognize the revenue from silenor product sales generated by the promotional efforts of p g 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to pay p g a fixed fee and a royalty fee as a percentage of us net sales  in each case on a quarterly basis during the term of the agreement 
we have included the amounts of the fixed fees in the table above 
at december   fixed fees due amounted to million  which is recorded as an accrued liability and is not reflected in the table above 
future royalty payments are not included in the table above because we cannot reasonably estimate them at this time 
we have contracted with various consultants and other vendors to assist in clinical trial work  pre clinical studies  data analysis  and activities to support the marketing of silenor 
the contracts are generally terminable at any time  but obligate us to reimburse the providers for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination 
we also have employment agreements with each of our current executive officers that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting for certain share based awards if their employment with us is terminated under specified circumstances 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
revenue recognition  which provides guidance on recognizing revenue in arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this standard impacts the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as a separate unit of accounting 
it also modifies the manner in which the consideration received from the transaction is allocated to the multiple deliverables and no longer permits the use of the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
this accounting standard is effective for the first reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists primarily of money market funds and available for sale securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we also periodically invest in us government debt securities 
to the extent we hold securities other than money market funds  our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities consisting of money market funds and united states government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we also generally time the maturities of our investments to correspond with our expected cash needs  allowing us to avoid realizing any potential losses from having to sell securities prior to their maturities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
our cash is invested in accordance with a policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our treasury managers and a review of our holdings 
while we believe our cash and cash equivalents are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our investments will not be subject to future adverse changes in market value
