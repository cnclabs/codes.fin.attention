overview our mission is to help people be more productive  be less stressed  and have more fun when they re on the go 
our personalized navigation services get you and get you there and help on the go people make daily decisions about where to go  how to get there  what to do  and even when to go and we make it possible across mobile devices  mobile applications  wireless carriers  automobiles  and mobile enterprises  both domestically and abroad 
in the three months ended june   we had a monthly average of million paying end users 
as a leading provider of personalized navigation and location based services  we are well positioned to capitalize on growing market opportunities to reach new customers and serve more people in more places with features such as location based search and voice guided navigation 
by using the most integral tools of their daily lives  their mobile phones and vehicles  people can access our personalized navigation and location based services almost anytime and anywhere to help them quickly decide where to go  how to get there  what to do  and even when to go in both personal and professional settings 
consumers  wireless carriers  enterprises and automobile manufacturers and oems are our customers 
we generate revenue from recurring service subscriptions  software licenses  premium services and mobile advertising and commerce 
end users through recurring subscriptions for our services are generally billed for our services through their wireless carrier 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a monthly subscription fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  or a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  or based on usage or other basis 
we also derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software in automotive navigation applications  as well as through premium services sold to consumers and mobile advertising sold to advertisers and advertising agencies 
through our hosted service delivery model  we provide our solutions to end users and customers through the networks of leading wireless carriers in the united states  including at t  sprint  t mobile and us cellular as well as through certain carriers in other countries 
our flexible and proprietary platform enables us to efficiently reach and retain tens of millions of end users  across more than types of mobile phones  all major mobile phone operating systems and a broad range of wireless network protocols 
this platform provides data and analytics to create more personalized experiences for mobile applications  location based advertising and customer lifecycle management in september  we and our largest customer  sprint  entered into an amendment to our agreement that results in us receiving a fixed annual fee from sprint for their bundled service subscribers use of our navigation services which is not dependent upon the number of subscribers participating in those bundles until such time as a specified threshold is reached 
this amendment affected our results of operations when it became effective in september  however  the full effect of this amendment is evident beginning with the three months ended 
table of contents december  as the amendment was in effect for the entire quarter 
over time  we anticipate that our amended agreement with sprint will result in further declines in arpu due to anticipated increases in the number of sprint bundle subscribers with access to our services and the significant reduction in revenue from sprint for bundled basic navigation services compared to the quarters prior to implementation of the amendment 
although we are entitled to receive a greater share of revenue from enterprise lbs  mobile commerce and premium navigation services than we were previously  we may not be able to realize these benefits in the short term or at all 
we cannot predict the ultimate financial impact of our amended agreement with sprint 
as a result of this amendment to our agreement with sprint providing for a fixed annual fee  we believe that future arpu will no longer provide a meaningful indicator of our financial performance 
accordingly  we do not intend to use the arpu metric beginning in fiscal  but will continue to report the number of paying end users for our services 
in september  we also amended our agreement with tomtom maps  to change the fee structure for map and poi data we provide as part of our navigation services in sprint s bundled offerings 
the material impact of the amendment is to align the manner in which we pay fees to tomtom maps with the manner in which we receive revenue from sprint 
pursuant to the amended agreement  we will pay tomtom maps a percentage of fees we collect from sprint for basic navigation services and our gross advertising and mobile commerce revenue  as well as a flat monthly fee per subscriber for premium navigation services 
we also agreed to certain guaranteed minimum payments to tomtom maps for such services 
these amendments affected our results of operations commencing in fiscal although we have taken action to increase the predictability of certain of our third party map and poi data costs for services that we provide on an annual fixed fee basis that are not dependent on the number of subscribers  we may not have adequately aligned our fee structure for map and poi data with revenue from sprint s bundled offerings  and may not be successful in reducing the impact of the recent sprint amendment on our gross margin 
in january  we entered into an amendment to our agreement with at t  one of our wireless carrier customers whose payments to us represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
this amendment extended our existing agreement with at t through march and provided that we will continue to be the exclusive provider of white label gps navigation services to at t 
the amendment did not impact our revenue for fiscal and our amended agreement with at t retained the prior terms  including the fee per subscriber per month model 
for fiscal and  at t represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
at t is not required to offer our lbs 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on at t for a material portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
in march  we entered into amendments to our agreement with ford  to which we provide an on board navigation solution 
the amendments modified the nature of certain of our obligations under our original agreement  and provided for additional payments to us 
as a result of these modifications  we now recognize revenue from customized software upon delivery to  and acceptance by  ford of our on board navigation solutions  and we recognize royalty revenue earned from the distribution of our customized software in vehicles as the vehicles are produced 
in addition  we recognize third party content and related costs of revenue when revenue is recognized 
our total revenue grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal our net income also increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal key components of our results of operations sources of revenue we primarily derive our revenue from our wireless carrier customers for their customers subscriptions to our lbs  as well as from activation fees for certain of our services 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a monthly subscription fee per end user  a fixed annual fee 
table of contents for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services or a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  or based on usage or other basis 
certain of our contracts provide our wireless carrier customers with discounts based on the number of end users paying for our services in a given month 
in general  our wireless carrier customers pay us a lower monthly fee per end user if an end user subscribes to our lbs as part of a bundle of mobile data or voice services than if an end user subscribes to our lbs on a standalone basis 
we also offer our applications directly to end users through application stores such as apple s or google s android 
in addition  we derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
in the future  we may have other revenue models 
for example  we recently implemented revenue models  including fees for advertising supported arrangements  and versions of our services that allow for upgrades to more premium versions for a fee 
our wireless carrier customers are responsible for billing and collecting the fees they charge their subscribers for the right to use our lbs 
when we are paid on a revenue sharing basis with our wireless carrier customers  the amount we receive varies depending on several factors  including the revenue share rate negotiated with the wireless carrier customer  the price charged to the subscriber by the wireless carrier customer  the specific sales channel of the wireless carrier customer in which the service is offered and the features and capability of the service 
as a result of these factors  the amount we receive for any subscriber may vary considerably  and is subject to change over time 
in addition  the amount we are paid per end user may also vary depending upon the metric used to determine the amount of the payment  including the number of end users at any time during a month  the average monthly paying end users  the number and timing of end user billing cycles and end user activity 
although our wireless carrier customers generally have sole discretion about how to price our lbs to their subscribers  our revenue sharing arrangements generally include monthly minimum fees per end user 
to a much lesser extent  we also sell our services directly to consumers through our website and through application stores 
subscription fees from our wireless carrier customers represented a substantial majority of our revenue for fiscal in fiscal  sprint and at t represented and of our revenue  respectively 
subscription fees from our gps navigator service represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from our automotive navigation solutions  enterprise lbs sometimes referred to as mrm  mobile advertising and commerce and premium lbs represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
gps navigator is our flagship voice guided real time  turn by turn  mobile navigation service 
our technology also powers automotive navigation services that provide accurate  easy to use lbs to drivers  including search  poi and traffic functionality 
our enterprise lbs solutions allow enterprises to monitor and manage mobile workforces and assets by using our lbs platform to track job status and the location of workers  field assets and equipment 
we are developing other lbs solutions with new business models and distribution channels in our current lbs market and adjacent markets 
these solutions include tablet devices  location based mobile advertising and commerce services and premium lbs 
while we have already introduced certain components or initial versions of several of these lbs solutions  the scope and timing of broader and more commercially viable offerings is uncertain 
the ultimate scope and timing of any future releases are dependent on many factors  including adoption by wireless carrier customers and automobile manufacturers and oems of the lbs solutions  end user adoption and preferences  the quality  features and timing of our product offerings  the impact of competition  and market acceptance of mobile advertising and social networking 
see the section entitled business our services and products for additional information relating to our gps navigator  on board navigation  enterprise lbs and other lbs solutions 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to cover the costs of these development efforts 
in fiscal and  we generated and of our revenue  respectively  in the united states 
in absolute dollars  revenue from our international operations increased in fiscal we are pursuing expansion opportunities with wireless carriers in other countries and therefore expect international revenue to increase in absolute dollars over the longer term 

table of contents cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the third party content  such as map  poi  traffic  gas price and weather data and voice recognition technology that we use in providing our lbs 
our cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with data center operations  customer support  the amortization of capitalized software and stock based compensation 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is the fees we pay to providers of map and poi data  tomtom maps and navteq 
we have long term agreements with tomtom maps and navteq pursuant to which we pay royalties according to a variety of different fee schedules  including on a per use basis  on a per end user per month basis and commencing in fiscal  on a fixed fee basis for certain navigation offerings 
we primarily provide customer support through a third party provider to whom we provide training and assistance with problem resolution 
we use three outsourced  hosted data centers to provide our services and industry standard hardware to provide our lbs 
we generally offer to our wireless carrier customers and generally maintain at least uptime every month  excluding designated periods of maintenance 
our internal targets for service uptime are even higher 
we have in the past  and may in the future  not achieve our targets for service availability and may incur penalties for failure to meet contractual service availability requirements  including loss of a portion of subscriber fees for the month or termination of our wireless carrier customer agreement 
we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as the number of our end users increases  including those through bundled or free offerings  average use of our services by end users increases and additional operating costs and depreciation associated with our planned data center capacity and redundancy increases  as well as increased amortization of capitalized software development costs 
in addition  we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase over time as we continue to enhance the richness of the content offered by our products and if we increase the level of our revenue from automotive navigation solutions 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  which include salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense 
other expenses include marketing program costs  facilities  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional service fees 
we allocate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of the fair value of options granted  based on the department in which the option holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent and depreciation  to each expense category based on headcount 
our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal and fiscal as we became a public company and built our infrastructure and added employees across all categories to support our growth  develop new services and products  and expand into international markets 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in fiscal as we continue in these endeavors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our development employees and use of outside consultants 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving the ease of use and functionality of our existing services  as well as developing new service and product offerings in our existing markets and in new markets 
the majority of our research and development employees are located in our development centers in china and  as a result  a substantial portion of our research and development expense is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  notably the chinese renminbi  or rmb 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing staff  commissions earned by our sales personnel and the cost of marketing programs and advertising 
as we primarily rely on our wireless carrier customers to market and promote our services to their subscribers  our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the cost of supporting our wireless carrier customers and attracting new wireless carrier customers to offer our lbs 
we cooperate with our wireless carrier customers in 
table of contents marketing our lbs solutions to their subscribers by preparing marketing materials and working with them on promotional campaigns 
we also promote our service offerings through a variety of other programs and online advertisements 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional services and corporate expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
during fiscal and  other income expense  net also included the expense resulting from the change in fair value of our outstanding series e preferred stock warrants 
we classified these warrants as liabilities on our balance sheets and recorded changes in their fair value from period to period in other income expense  net on our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   all remaining outstanding series e preferred stock warrants had been exercised and the warrant liability was reclassified to preferred stock 
the preferred shares converted to common stock upon the closing of our ipo and were reclassified as common stock and additional paid in capital 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits earned from our lbs in the united states 
we expect our income tax expense for fiscal to be approximately of pretax income because of the concentration of earnings in the united states 
our effective tax rate could be reduced if our international revenue substantially increases as a percentage of revenue  due to the lower corporate tax rates available in certain countries outside the united states and the availability of net operating loss carryforwards in those countries 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require our judgment in its application 
in other cases  our judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting policies that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of those services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive our revenue from subscriptions to access our lbs  which are generally provided through our wireless carrier customers that offer our services to their subscribers 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a monthly subscription fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services or a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  or based on usage or other basis 
we recognize monthly fees related to our services in the month we provide the services 
we defer amounts received in advance of the service being provided and recognize the deferred amounts when the monthly service 
table of contents has been provided 
we recognize revenue for fixed annual fees for any number of subscribers receiving our services as part of bundles monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
our agreements do not contain general rights of refund once the service has been provided 
we also establish allowances for estimated credits subsequently issued to end users by our wireless carrier customers 
we defer activation fees received upon the initiation of certain services and recognize the deferred amounts over the estimated average length of subscription to the service  historically months 
we recognize as revenue the amount our wireless carrier customers report to us as we provide our services  which are net of any revenue sharing or other fees earned and deducted by our wireless carrier customers 
we are not the principal provider when selling access to our lbs through our wireless carrier customers as the subscribers directly contract with our wireless carrier customers 
in addition  we earn a fixed fee or fixed percentage of fees charged by our wireless carrier customers and our wireless carrier customers have the sole ability to set the price charged to their subscribers for our service 
our wireless carrier customers have direct responsibility for billing and collecting those fees from their subscribers and we and our wireless carrier customers may offer subscribers a day free trial for our service 
we also derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties earned from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
we generally recognize software customization revenue using the completed contract method of contract accounting under which revenue is recognized upon delivery to  and acceptance by  the automobile manufacturer of our on board navigation solutions 
we generally recognize royalty revenue as the vehicles are produced  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
in certain instances  due to the nature and timing of monthly revenue and subscriber reporting from our wireless carrier customers  we may be required to make estimates of the amount of lbs revenue to recognize from a wireless carrier customer for the current period 
for example  certain of our wireless carrier customers do not provide us with sufficient monthly individual subscriber billing period details to allow us to compute the allocation of monthly service fees to the individual end user s service period  and in such cases we make estimates of any required service period revenue cutoff 
in addition  if we fail to receive an accurate revenue report from a wireless carrier customer for the month  we will need to estimate the amount of revenue that should be recorded for that month 
these estimates may require judgment  and we consider certain factors and information in making these estimates such as subscriber data supplied by our wireless carrier customers  wireless carrier customer specific historical subscription and revenue reporting trends  end user subscription data from our internal systems  and data from comparable distribution channels of our other wireless carrier customers 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate recognizable revenue from a wireless carrier customer for a given period  we defer recognition of revenue to the period in which we receive and validate the wireless carrier customer s revenue report and all of our revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we have recorded an estimated revenue amount  we record any difference between the estimated revenue and actual revenue in the period when we receive the final revenue reports from our wireless carrier customer  which typically occurs within the following month 
software development costs 
we account for the costs of computer software we develop for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs  which are incurred during the application development stage  and amortizing those costs over the application s estimated useful life  which generally ranges from to months depending on the type of application 
costs incurred and capitalized during the application development stage generally include the costs of software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
such costs primarily include payroll and payroll related expenses for employees directly involved in the application development  as well as third party developer 
table of contents fees 
we expense preliminary evaluation costs as they are incurred before the application development stage  as well as post development implementation and operation costs  such as training  maintenance and minor upgrades 
we begin amortizing capitalized costs when a project is ready for its intended use  and we periodically reassess the estimated useful life of a project considering the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors which may result in a shorter remaining life 
we capitalized million  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to these costs  which was recorded in cost of revenue  totaled   and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we also account for the costs of computer software we develop for customers requiring significant modification or customization by deferring qualifying costs under the completed contract method 
all such development costs incurred are deferred until the related revenue is recognized 
we deferred  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
upon delivery of certain customized software in fiscal  we recognized in cost of revenue million of previously deferred costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of our property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is significantly impacted by our estimates and assumptions of future revenue  costs  and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
when these factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
we base the impairment  if any  on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows of those assets  and record it in the period in which we make the determination 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements under the fair value recognition method  which requires us to measure the stock based compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value  and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the employees requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of these awards with time based vesting on a straight line basis over an employee s requisite service period of each of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
our stock based compensation expense was as follows fiscal year ended june  in thousands cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense as of june   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards  net of estimated forfeitures  that we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  which requires a number of estimates and assumptions 
in valuing share based awards under the fair value accounting method  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share based awards prior to exercising 
the expected volatility of our stock is based on the historical volatility of various comparable companies  as we do not have sufficient historical data with regards to the volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term was based on an analysis of our historical exercise and cancellation activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock  the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
in addition  the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for fiscal  and  we calculated the fair value of options granted to employees using the black scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions fiscal year ended june  dividend yield expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate preferred stock warrants 
in january  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our series e convertible preferred stock 
warrants to purchase  shares of our series e convertible preferred stock were outstanding at june  and were classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
the warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income expense  net 
as of december   all remaining outstanding series e preferred stock warrants had been exercised and the warrant liability was reclassified to preferred stock 
we recorded charges of  and  to other income expense  net for fiscal and  respectively  to reflect an increase in the fair value of these warrants 
we estimated the fair value using the black scholes model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  or irs  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including an examination by irs for our fiscal  and tax returns 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  will be realized 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for fiscal  and  as well as a percentage that each line item represents of our revenue for those periods 
the additional key metrics presented are used in addition to the financial measures reflected in the consolidated statements of income data to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
the period to period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 
fiscal year ended june  in thousands consolidated statements of income data revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of revenue revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended june  in millions  except per user data additional key metrics average monthly revenue per user arpu average monthly paying end users comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to growth in the average monthly paying end users from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily resulting from the continued adoption of sprint s simply everything and any mobile  anytime plans which include our lbs  as well as an increase in end users of at t navigator and growth through new carrier relationships  including t mobile and us cellular 
we also experienced significant revenue growth from our automotive navigation partnership with ford during fiscal  with the launch of ford mytouch on certain models in north america 
we calculate average monthly paying end users for a period by averaging the number of paying end users for each month in the period  and exclude any users that subscribe under daily or annual plans 
generally  we consider a paying end user to be a wireless carrier subscriber for whom we are paid and for which such subscriber s mobile device has the capability to access our lbs 
average monthly revenue is calculated by dividing revenue for the period associated with paying end users by the number of months in the period 
arpu is calculated by dividing average monthly revenue by average monthly paying end users 
we exclude from our arpu calculation users and revenue associated with our automotive navigation solutions and advertising 
although our end users increased substantially  our arpu declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in arpu was due in large part to the september amendment to our agreement with sprint as discussed below  whereby we now receive a fixed fee from sprint to provide our services to subscribers to sprint s service bundles up to certain thresholds and we no longer receive additional revenue for additional sprint bundle subscribers using our services 
as a result of the changes to our agreement with sprint  and our plans to introduce various paid and free service plans through wireless carriers and open marketplaces  arpu will no longer provide a meaningful indicator of the health of our business 
we do not intend to use this metric beginning in fiscal  but will continue to report the number of subscribers for our services 

table of contents in september  we amended our agreement with sprint  which changed the way in which we receive revenue from the majority of the services we provide to sprint s subscribers 
rather than receiving a fee per subscriber per month  we agreed to receive a guaranteed annual fixed fee from sprint for navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles with other sprint services 
the annual fee will change from year to year over the contract period and limits the maximum number of subscribers covered under such fee in a given year 
sprint will generally pay us these annual fees in advance 
in return  sprint agreed that our right to be sprint s preferred supplier of navigation applications would be broadened and our preferred supplier rights are extended from december  to december  sprint may terminate our agreement for any reason  beginning june   by providing notice at least business days prior to termination 
we and sprint also agreed that sprint branded navigation services offered as part of a bundled offering will transition to telenav branded navigation services over time 
in addition  bundle opportunities are expanded and may include sprint s prepaid subscriber base in the future 
we recognize revenue for the aggregate annual fees monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
our portion of the revenue sharing arrangements for monthly recurring charge navigation subscribers  enterprise lbs subscribers and revenue generated from mobile commerce services was increased under the amendment and will also apply to revenue generated from other premium services we may provide to bundled and other subscribers during the term of the agreement 
growth in the number of end users in fiscal primarily reflects sprint s decision to continue to offer and promote certain bundles in which all end users under those plans receive the right to use our lbs without additional charge 
because a substantial majority of our end users are able to access our lbs through bundled offerings  our arpu has declined 
as a result of these pricing strategies  arpu declined by from in fiscal to in fiscal  however  the average monthly paying end users of our lbs increased by and our revenue increased during the same period 
the impact of this decline in arpu for our million average monthly paying end users during fiscal was a reduction in revenue based on these end users of million for fiscal the impact of this lower arpu was more than offset by the million increase in average monthly paying end users  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  resulting in a net revenue increase of million for fiscal we believe we would not have achieved the million increase in revenue had we not adopted these pricing strategies 
in fiscal and  revenue from sprint represented and of our revenue  respectively  and revenue from at t represented and of our revenue  respectively 
no other customer represented more than of our revenue in either period 
subscription fees from our gps navigator service represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we primarily sell our services in the united states 
in fiscal and  revenue derived from us sources represented and of our revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the substantial majority of our cost of revenue related to costs of third party content and technology that we use in providing our lbs such as map  poi  traffic  gas price and weather data and voice recognition technology 
the remaining portion of our cost of revenue included expenses associated with data center operations  customer support  the amortization of capitalized software and stock based compensation 
in addition  we expensed certain capitalized software development costs associated with revenue recognized from ford during fiscal cost of revenue increased at a higher rate than the increase in revenue for the comparable period primarily as a result of the third party content and related costs associated with the on board navigation revenue from ford and  to a lesser extent  the effect of our fixed fee arrangement with sprint  which resulted in a lower rate of revenue per end user in fiscal without an equivalent decrease in the respective costs related to such end users 
the 
table of contents increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily driven by the increase in our number of end users 
the majority of the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal was due to a increase in third party content costs  as well as increased software amortization costs  including deferred software development costs expensed in connection with revenue from ford  and increased customer support costs 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the tomtom maps agreement  or the tomtom maps amendment 
the terms of the tomtom maps amendment were retroactively effective as of august  and change the fee structure for map and poi data we use to provide its services for sprint s bundled offerings 
the material impact of the tomtom maps amendment is to better align the manner in which we pay fees to tomtom maps with the manner in which we receive revenue from sprint 
pursuant to the tomtom maps amendment  we will pay tomtom maps a percentage of the fees earned from sprint for basic navigation services and gross advertising and mobile commerce revenue and a flat monthly fee per subscriber for premium navigation services 
we also will pay tomtom maps certain guaranteed minimum payments for such services 
previously  we paid tomtom maps a specific fee per subscriber or a per transaction fee for our sprint bundled offerings 
the expiration of the license period for navigation services provided by tomtom maps for sprint s bundled offerings has been changed from july  to the earlier of december  or the date of termination of our agreement with sprint with respect to those bundled services 
we anticipate these changes to our tomtom maps agreement will reduce in part the impact on our cost of revenue of the anticipated increase in the number of sprint bundle subscribers without offsetting increases in revenue 
however  we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as the number of our end users increases  average usage of our services by end users increases and from amortization and depreciation expense associated with planned data center capacity and redundancy increases  as well as increased amortization of capitalized software development costs 
in addition  we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase over time as we continue to enhance the richness of the content offered by our products and if we increase the level of our revenue from automotive navigation solutions 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of our end users 
our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to the increased proportion of revenue contributed from our on board navigation solutions  which generally have higher associated content costs and resulting lower gross margins than our lbs services provided to our wireless carrier customers 
we expect our gross margin to decline due to slowing revenue growth as a result of the new fixed fee arrangement with sprint and higher anticipated usage of third party content by our end users 
we also anticipate we will earn lower gross margins on certain other product offerings  such as on board navigation products 
changes in product mix may also cause gross margins to decline over time 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with increased headcount to enhance the functionality of our services and develop new offerings and increased compensation and benefits for our existing employees  as well as an increase in costs related to the use of consultants 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the total number of research and development personnel increased  from at june  to at june  we believe that as we continue to invest in expanding the lbs we offer  establish relationships with new wireless carrier customers and develop new services and products  revenue from those investments and development efforts will lag the related research and development expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand the services and products we offer 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in 
table of contents fiscal was the result of increased investment in our marketing and business development organizations  including the hiring of additional and more experienced personnel  including two vice presidents 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our relationships with wireless carrier customers and engage in programs to market our services to their subscribers 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to added personnel  consultants utilized for our preparations for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  legal costs  and audit and tax professional services 
legal costs included settlement of certain intellectual property litigation and increased legal fees for litigation  intellectual property protection and immigration 
the total number of general and administrative personnel increased  from at june  to at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and fiscal we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we incur legal fees and potentially other costs in connection with litigation in which we are named defendants or our wireless carrier customers are named defendants and for which they have notified us that they are seeking or may seek indemnification from us 
we also expect to incur additional general and administration expenses in fiscal and beyond associated with being a public company  including higher legal  corporate insurance  audit and tax and financial reporting expenses as well as the costs of maintaining compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
other income expense  net 
our other income expense  net was  in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was primarily due to increased interest income due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances and  to a lesser extent  elimination of the expense related to the increase in fair value of our series e preferred stock warrants 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal and fiscal the usage of our remaining us federal loss carryforwards is substantially limited each fiscal year by section of the internal revenue code 
in addition  on september   the state of california enacted assembly bill into law which among other provisions  suspended net operating loss deductions for our fiscal and  extends for two years the carryforward period of any net operating losses not utilized due to such suspension  and limits the utilization of research and development credit carryforwards to no more than of the tax liability before credits 
we expect that for fiscal our effective tax rate will be approximately and reflects favorable changes in california tax law regarding apportioning income to the state  which results in an expected reduction in our california state taxes 
we adopted the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  standard for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes at the beginning of fiscal as of june   our cumulative unrecognized tax benefit was million  of which  was netted against deferred tax assets 
upon adoption  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  california  various states  and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries 
the statute of limitations remain open for fiscal through in us and state jurisdictions  and for fiscal through in foreign jurisdictions 
fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized 
the irs is conducting an examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal and as of june   the irs has concluded the audit for our fiscal us federal income tax return which resulted in no adjustments that have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe it was reasonably possible that  as of june   the gross unrecognized tax benefits  could decrease whether by payment  release  or a combination of both by as much as million in the next 
table of contents months 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our provision for income taxes 
we had  and  accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at june  and  respectively 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to growth in the average monthly paying end users from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to adoption of sprint s simply everything plans which include our lbs sprint navigation  as well as an increase in end users of at t navigator 
although our end users increased substantially  our arpu declined from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline in arpu was due in part to the increasing proportion of end users accessing our services through our wireless carrier customers white label offerings  for which we receive lower monthly fees per end user when compared to our branded offerings 
the contractual terms of our bundled offerings with certain wireless carrier customers also provide us a lower per end user fee as the absolute number of subscriptions to those bundled offerings increases  thereby reducing arpu 
in addition  arpu also declined as a result of the july  reduction of our monthly fees per end user for a majority of our lbs that are bundled with other sprint services 
growth in revenue and number of end users for the periods presented primarily reflect sprint s decision to offer and promote certain bundles in which all end users under those plans receive the right to use our lbs without additional charge 
to benefit from increased numbers of end users  we agreed to provide sprint with lower monthly per end user fees for these bundles compared to other plans with sprint 
in fiscal  we further lowered pricing on bundled offerings to sprint  as discussed below 
because a substantial majority of our end users are able to access our lbs through bundled offerings  our arpu has declined  however  the substantial increase in number of end users has resulted in an increase in revenue 
in addition  at t s decision to provide our gps navigator as a white label offering to its end users  for which we are paid a lower monthly fee per end user compared to telenav branded offerings  also contributed to the decline in our arpu 
although the migration of at t to a white label offering reduced our arpu  the number of end users subscribing to our services through at t has increased 
as a result of these pricing strategies  arpu declined by from in fiscal to in fiscal  however  the average monthly paying end users of our lbs increased by and our revenue increased during the same period 
the impact of this decline in arpu for our million average monthly paying end users during fiscal was a reduction in revenue based on these end users of million for fiscal the impact of this lower arpu was more than offset by the million increase in average monthly paying end users  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  resulting in a net revenue increase of million for fiscal we believe we would not have achieved the million increase in revenue had we not adopted these pricing strategies 
in fiscal and  revenue from sprint represented and of our revenue  respectively  and revenue from at t represented and of our revenue  respectively 
no other wireless carrier or other customer represented more than of our revenue in either period 
effective july   we amended our agreement with sprint and agreed to receive a reduced monthly fee per end user for a majority of our lbs that are bundled with sprint services 
we also agreed to provide certain activity based discount incentives to sprint for the remainder of calendar in return  sprint agreed to extend our right to be its exclusive provider of sprint navigation  agreed not to terminate our agreement without cause prior to december   agreed to increase the share of any future advertising revenue we are entitled to receive and modified certain other terms 
in september  we further amended our agreement with sprint  which changed the way in which we receive revenue from the majority of the services we provide to sprint s subscribers

cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the substantial majority of our cost of revenue related to costs of third party content and technology that we use in providing our lbs such as map  poi  traffic  gas price and weather data and voice recognition technology 
the remaining portion of our cost of revenue included expenses associated with data center operations  customer support  the amortization of capitalized software and stock based compensation 
cost of revenue increased at a slightly lower rate than the increase in revenue for the comparable period as a result of the use of lower cost content and lower customer support costs per end user resulting from an increased portion of customer support provided by our wireless carrier customers and our greater use of outsourcing 
however  these factors were partially offset by the decrease in arpu and higher usage rates of third party content by our end users who purchase our services as part of a bundle 
the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily driven by the increase in our number of end users 
the majority of the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was due to a increase in third party content costs and  to a lesser extent  from a increase in customer support costs as well as increased costs of data center operations 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of our end users 
our gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with increased headcount to enhance the functionality of our services and develop new offerings  increased compensation and benefits for our existing employees  as well as million of stock compensation expense associated with certain outstanding stock option grants that vested upon the closing of our ipo

our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was the result of leveraging our investment in sales and marketing across a higher revenue base 
general and administrative

the total number of general and administrative personnel increased  from at june  to at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal other income expense  net 
our other income expense  net was  in fiscal and  in fiscal the change was primarily due to decreases in the expense related to the increase in fair value of our series e preferred stock warrants  partially offset by lower interest income due to reductions in the interest rates paid on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
as of december   all remaining series e preferred stock warrants had been exercised and the warrant liability was reclassified to preferred stock 
the preferred stock converted upon the closing of our ipo and the preferred stock was reclassified as common stock and additional paid in capital 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a tax benefit in fiscal related to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance against us federal and state deferred tax assets and a reduction in the forecasted federal research credit for fiscal due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit effective december  the increase was partially offset by a tax benefit recognized in fiscal for a tax deduction related to qualified domestic production activities under section of the internal revenue code and by the release of the remaining valuation allowance related to us federal and state deferred tax assets 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our provision for income taxes 
we had  and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at june  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash at june   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which primarily consisted of money market mutual funds  municipal securities  corporate bonds and commercial paper held by well capitalized financial institutions 
from inception until fiscal  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity 
on may   we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock 
we raised net proceeds from the offering of million after deducting the underwriter s discount and offering expenses payable by us  based on an ipo price of per share  including  shares of common stock purchased by the underwriters in connection with the exercise of their over allotment option 
our accounts receivable are heavily concentrated in a small number of customers 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance was million  of which at t  ford and t mobile represented  and  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance due from sprint represented less than of total accounts receivable as of june  and will fluctuate based upon the timing of invoicing and payment under sprint s fixed annual fee arrangement 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the timing and extent of expenditures to support development efforts  the expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities and headcount  the introduction of our new and enhanced service and product offerings and the growth in our end user base 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our financial obligations through at least the next months 
however  we may experience lower than expected cash generated from operating activities  revenue that is lower than we anticipate  or greater than expected cost of revenue or operating expenses 
our revenue and operating results could be lower than we anticipate if  among other reasons  our wireless carrier customers  two of which we are substantially dependent upon for a large portion of our revenue  were to limit or terminate our relationships with them  we were to fail to successfully compete in our highly competitive market  including against competitors 
table of contents who offer their services for free  our wireless carrier customers were to elect not to market and distribute our lbs to end users  or our wireless carrier customers were to elect to lower the prices charged to their subscribers for our service 
in the future  we may acquire businesses or technologies or license technologies from third parties  and we may decide to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to the extent we believe this is necessary to successfully complete these acquisitions or license these technologies 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  at the time we make such determinations  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results  financial condition and liquidity and cash position 
net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the improvement in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increased number of end users of our services and related revenue generated from those end users  offset to a lesser extent by increases in our operating costs 
cash provided by or used in operating activities has historically been affected by growth in our end user base and increases in our operating costs  which are primarily due to increased headcount and royalty payments for portions of the content provided in our services 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was provided principally by net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  and million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities

cash generated in fiscal included net proceeds of million as a result of the completion of our ipo in may in fiscal  cash generated was due to the proceeds of exercise of options for our common stock 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
however  we have agreed to pay minimum annual license fees to certain of our third party content providers 
our principal commitments  in addition to those related to our third party content providers  consist of obligations under facility leases for office space in sunnyvale  california  kirkland  washington  ashburn  virginia  southfield  michigan  shanghai  china  beijing  china  xi an  china  and chelmsford  england

consists of minimum noncancelable financial commitments primarily related to fees owed to certain third party content providers  regardless of usage level 
at june   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million 
due to uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlements with the taxing authority will occur 
warranties and indemnifications our agreements with our wireless carrier customers that offer our lbs generally include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if our lbs infringe a third party s intellectual property rights or for other specified reasons 
we have in the past received indemnification requests or notices of their intent to seek indemnification in the future from our wireless carrier customers with respect to litigation in which our wireless carrier customers have been named as defendants 
see the section entitled legal proceedings 
as it relates to past indemnification requests or notices  in certain situations we have agreed to defend or indemnify our wireless carriers for the indemnity demands 
for those notices where we have not agreed to provide indemnity or defense to date  or future demands for indemnity  we may in the future agree to defend and indemnify our wireless carriers or other customers  irrespective of whether we believe that we have an obligation to indemnify them or whether we believe our lbs infringe the asserted intellectual property rights 
alternatively  we may reject certain of our wireless carrier or other customers indemnity demands  including the outstanding demands  which may lead to disputes with our wireless carrier or other customers  negatively impact our relationships with them or result in litigation against us 
our wireless carrier or other customers may also claim that any rejection of their indemnity demands constitutes a material breach of our agreements with them  allowing them to terminate such agreements 
if we make substantial payments as a result of indemnity demands  our relationships with our wireless carrier or other customers are negatively impacted or any of our wireless carrier or customer agreements is terminated  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 
to date  we have not incurred material costs and do not have material liabilities related to such obligations recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors  officers and certain other employees for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while such persons are or were serving at our request in such capacity 
we may terminate the indemnification agreements with these persons upon the termination of their services with us  but termination will not affect claims for indemnification related to events occurring prior to the effective date of termination 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our potential exposure 
we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of june  and based upon our historical experience and information known as of june   we do not believe it is likely that we will have significant liability for the above indemnities at june  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued revised guidance intended to improve disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this guidance requires new disclosures as well as clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
new disclosures under this guidance require separate information about significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the reason for such transfers  and also require purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements information for level measurement to be included in the rollforward of activity on a gross basis 
the guidance also clarifies the requirement to determine the level of disaggregation for fair value measurement disclosures and the requirement to disclose valuation techniques and inputs used for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements in either level or level the revised guidance was effective for interim and annual fiscal years beginning after december   except for disclosure requirements related to level measurement 
we adopted the revised guidance during fiscal and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the revised accounting guidance for the rollforward of activity on a gross basis for level fair value measurement will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal  which commences on july  we do not expect the revised guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to achieve convergence with international financial reporting standards or ifrs 
the amended guidance clarified existing fair value measurement guidance  revised certain measurement guidance and expanded the disclosure requirements concerning level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we adopted revised guidance which supersedes certain guidance with respect to accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revised guidance changes the determination of when individual deliverables in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across separately identifiable deliveries 
the revised guidance was effective for our fiscal year beginning july  the adoption of the revised guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we invest in a variety of securities  which primarily consist of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities and other debt securities of domestic corporations 
due to the nature of these investments and relatively short duration of the underlying securities  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
a appreciation or depreciation in interest rates in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our interest income or the fair value of our marketable securities 
foreign currency risk 
substantially all of our revenue has been generated to date from our end users in the united states and  as such  our revenue has not been substantially exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange 
table of contents rates 
however  most of our contracts with our wireless carrier customers outside of the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore expose us to foreign currency risk 
should the revenue generated outside of the united states grow in absolute amounts and as a percentage of our revenue  we will increasingly be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  a substantial portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states  are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the chinese rmb 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 
an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated receivables as of june  and june  would not have resulted in a material loss 
to date  we have not used any foreign exchange forward contracts or similar instruments to attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates
