item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of rvs and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our us market share in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the towables industry is approximately 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have a us market share of approximately 
our us and canadian market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we also manufacture and sell foot buses at our facility in southern california and manufacture and sell ambulances at our goshen coach facility in elkhart  indiana 
our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the rv industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
capital acquisitions of  in fiscal were made primarily to purchase land and buildings to expand our towable and bus operations  replace buildings and equipment at our champion facility that were destroyed by a fire and replace machinery and equipment used in the ordinary course of business 
our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon the profitability of the business unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  purchasing  insurance  legal  human resources  risk management and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 
our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we generally do not finance dealers directly  but do provide repurchase agreements to the dealers floor plan lenders 
recent significant events on september   we acquired of towables holdings  inc  the parent company of heartland recreational vehicles  llc heartland  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
heartland is located in elkhart  indiana and is a major manufacturer of towable recreation vehicles 
under our ownership  heartland continues as an independent operation  in the same manner as our existing recreation vehicle and bus companies  and its operations are included in our towables reportable segment 
on march   we acquired sjc industries corp 
sjc  a privately held manufacturer of ambulances based in elkhart  indiana 
we have included the operations of sjc in our buses reportable segment because we believe the ambulance business is a natural fit with our bus business 

table of contents sjc has similar economic characteristics to our bus businesses and the nature of products  production processes  types of customers  distribution channels and regulatory environment are also similar to those for our bus businesses 
effective january   the operations of sjc were combined with goshen coach under one management team 
subsequent to july   the operations of goshen coach and sjc were combined within one facility 
industry outlook after two years of declining wholesale shipments  industry conditions in the rv market substantially improved in calendar  with total rv wholesale shipments up for the months ended december   according to the recreation vehicle industry association rvia 
the large increase in shipments in calendar was attributable to a number of forces in the market including rv dealers restocking of depleted lot inventories  improved floor plan financing availability to rv dealers and improved retail sales to consumers 
key wholesale statistics for the rv industry  as reported by rvia rounded to nearest hundred are as follows us and canada wholesale shipments calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units total us and canada wholesale shipments calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units total excluding folding camp trailers and truck campers  which the company does not manufacture 
for the seven month period ended july   wholesale rv shipments totaled  units  up compared to the same period one year ago 
towable units shipped for the seven month period ended july  totaled  units  an increase of  units or from the same period one year ago 
shipments of motorized units were  for the seven month period ended july   an increase of from the prior year period 
according to the rvia  calendar year wholesale shipments are forecast to total  units  a increase over rvia has also forecast that calendar year shipments will total  units  a reduction from the expected wholesale shipments 
given that dealer restocking appears to be completed  we believe that retail demand is the key to continued improvement in the rv industry 
with appropriate levels of dealer inventory  we believe that rv industry wholesale shipments will generally be on a one to one replenishment ratio with retail sales going forward 

table of contents key retail statistics for the rv industry  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  are as follows us and canada retail registrations calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units us and canada retail registrations calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units excluding camping trailers  which the company does not manufacture 
note data reported by statistical surveys  inc is based on official state records 
this information is subject to adjustment and is continuously updated 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  the company s wholesale rv shipments were as follows wholesale shipments fiscal year increase decrease change towables units motorized units retail shipments of the company s rv products  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  were as follows for calendar years  and us and canada retail registrations calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units us and canada retail registrations calendar year increase decrease change towables units motorized units our outlook for future retail sales is tempered by current fuel prices  the continuing rate of unemployment  the current low level of consumer confidence and poor income growth of consumers as well as credit constraints  all of which could slow the pace of rv sales 

table of contents however  if consumer confidence improves  retail and wholesale credit remains available and interest rates remain low  we would expect to see an improvement in rv sales and expect to benefit from our ability to increase production 
in addition  a positive longer term outlook for the rv segment is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales  and an increase in interest in the rv lifestyle among both older and younger segments of the population 
economic or industry wide factors affecting our rv business include raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our products 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
during fiscal  we have incurred some modest increases in the cost of raw materials and components 
steel  aluminum and thermoplastic prices have increased and there continues to be upward price pressure on several other raw material inputs 
historically  we have been able to pass along such price increases to our customers 
we implemented selling price increases in most of our product segments in early february to offset the increased input costs 
future increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we are unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts 
government entities are the primary purchasers or end users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life and are being continuously replaced by operators 
according to the mid size bus manufacturers association  unit sales of small and mid sized buses decreased for the six months ended june  compared with the same period in federal stimulus funds have helped the transit industry in the recent economic downturn  however that funding is ending and that has begun to have a negative effect on demand for our bus products 
ridership and municipal budgets are reduced and transit agencies operating costs have increased 
this softening has slowed order input at some of our bus operations 
the supply of chassis  used in both motorized rv and bus production  is adequate for now and we believe that available inventory would compensate for changes in supply schedules if they occur 
to date  we have not noticed any unusual cost increases from our chassis suppliers 
if the condition of the us auto industry deteriorates  this could result in supply interruptions and a decrease in our sales and earnings while we obtain replacement chassis from other sources

table of contents on august   the company agreed to purchase from the estate of wade f 
b 
thompson  shares of its common stock at a price of per share  representing an aggregate purchase price of  the transaction was consummated on august  critical accounting principles our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets we review our long lived assets individually or in a related group as appropriate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable from future cash flows attributable to the assets 
additionally  we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually on april of each year 
accordingly  we continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances represent a triggering event that would require us to complete an impairment assessment 
factors that we consider in determining whether a triggering event has occurred include  among other things  whether there has been a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or competition related to the operation of the asset  whether there has been a significant decrease in actual or expected operating results related to the asset and whether there are current plans to sell or dispose of the asset 
the determination of whether a triggering event has occurred is subject to significant management judgment  including at which point or fiscal quarter a triggering event has occurred when the relevant adverse factors persist over extended periods 
should a triggering event be deemed to occur  and for each of the annual impairment assessments  management is required to estimate the expected net cash flows to be realized over the life of the asset and or the asset s fair value 
fair values are often determined by a discounted cash flow model  although we also use a market approach in determining fair values when appropriate 
these estimates are also subject to significant management judgment including the determination of many factors such as sales growth rates  gross margin patterns  cost growth rates  terminal value assumptions  discount rates and comparable companies 
changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the determination of cash flows and fair value and could potentially result in future material impairments 
management engages an independent valuation firm in many cases to assist in its impairment assessments 
our april  annual assessment resulted in the identification of an impairment of one of our indefinite lived trademarks in our bus segment for which we recorded a  non cash charge in our fiscal third quarter to reduce the recorded value of this trademark to no other impairments were identified in this assessment 
the company has six individual reporting units that carry goodwill 
one reporting unit carries of our consolidated goodwill of  and a second reporting unit carries another of our consolidated goodwill 
for these two reporting units  our estimate of their fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by and  respectively  as of our april  assessment 
our other reporting units fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by in regards to our april assessment for the second reporting unit indicated above  we used both a discounted cash flows model and a market approach to determine an estimate of its fair value 
we weighed the discounted cash flow model slightly more because we believe that the discounted cash flow model better reflects the specific operating and other conditions impacting this unit as compared to the more general applicability of comparable market transactions 
assumptions which more significantly impact the discounted cash flows used in estimating the fair value of this unit included forecasted annual sales increases over the next five years  margin percentages over those years  terminal sales growth and weighted average cost of capital 
each of these estimates is subject to significant management judgment  however  we believe each to be reasonable based on currently available information regarding this unit s current and expected operations 
the more significant factors that might serve to cause future actual results to differ from these estimates include future rv industry volume and pricing pressure related to a highly competitive environment 
should such future actual results require us to reduce our expectations for this reporting unit  future impairment assessments may indicate that the related goodwill and or other intangible assets may be impaired and such impairment could be material 
our assessment of whether any triggering events occurred during the fourth quarter ended july  for which we should further analyze whether an impairment exists through that date did not result in the identification of such a triggering event 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation  products liability and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported 

table of contents the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator and actuary using various state statutes and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention sir for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a liability on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data  known cases and actuarial information 
amounts above the sir  up to a certain dollar amount  are covered by our excess insurance policy 
currently  we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of our self insured positions for products liability and personal injury matters 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
product warranty we generally provide retail customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty liability is adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty liabilities are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc  income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  if any 
valuation allowances must be considered due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets on a tax jurisdictional basis based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
we have evaluated the sustainability of our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet which includes the assessment of the cumulative income over recent prior periods 
based on the provisions of asc  we determined a valuation allowance was not required to be recorded against the recorded deferred income tax assets in any of the tax jurisdictions in which we currently operate 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of recreation vehicles and buses are recorded primarily when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from our property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
certain shipments are sold to customers on credit or cash on delivery cod terms 
we recognize revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 

table of contents products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floor plan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments we are contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with financial institutions providing inventory financing for certain dealers of certain of our products 
these arrangements  which are customary in the industry  provide for the repurchase of products sold to dealers in the event of default by the dealer 
the repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre defined curtailment arrangements and we typically resell the repurchased product at a discount from its repurchase price 
we account for the guarantee under our repurchase agreements of our dealers financing by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation 
this deferred amount is included in our repurchase and guarantee reserve 
additionally  the repurchase and guarantee reserve includes our estimated loss upon resale of expected repurchases 
this estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting our dealers 
our risk of loss under these repurchase agreements is reduced because a we sell our products to a large number of dealers under these arrangements  b the repurchase price we are obligated to pay declines over the period of the agreements generally up to eighteen months while the value of the related product may not decline ratably and c we have historically been able to readily resell any repurchased product 
we believe that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other material off balance sheet commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after years operating leases and other chassis consigned inventory unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations we have included in unrecognized tax benefits approximately  for payments expected to be made in fiscal unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of approximately  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payment 
total amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments amounts committed less than one year years years over years guarantees standby repurchase obligations total commercial commitments the standby repurchase obligations generally extend up to eighteen months from the date of sales of the related product to the dealer 
in estimating the expiration of the standby repurchase obligations  we used inventory reports as of july  from our dealers lending institutions and made an assumption for obligations for inventory aged months that it was financed evenly over the twelve month period
