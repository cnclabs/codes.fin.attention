item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes many forward looking statements 
for cautions about relying on such forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item general we are a leading company in high temperature superconductor hts materials and related technologies 
hts materials have the unique ability to conduct various signals or energy eg  electrical current or radio frequency rf signals with little or no resistance when cooled to critical temperatures 
electric currents that flow through conventional conductors encounter resistance that requires power to overcome and generates heat 
hts materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems  reducing power loss  lowering heat generation and decreasing electrical noise 
circuits designed to remove interference inherent in some rf signals can also be made from hts materials 
commercial use of hts materials requires a number of cutting edge technologies  including development of hts materials  specialized manufacturing expertise to create uniform thin layers of these materials  expert designs of circuits optimized for hts materials  and technologies to maintain an extremely low temperature environment for hts applications although the critical temperatures for hts are high compared with traditional superconductors  they are still extremely cold by other standards 
results of operations compared to net revenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues and government contract revenues 
net revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in net commercial product revenues decreased by  or  to million in from million in the decrease is the result of lower sales volume for our superlink products 
average sales prices for our products were essentially unchanged in from our two largest customers accounted for of our net commercial revenues in and these customers generally purchase products through non binding commitments with minimal lead times 
consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was principally the result of the completion of a large contract 
this reduced level of government contract revenue will continue as we use more of our limited engineering resources on our commercial projects 
cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs  manufacturing overhead and provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted principally from lower production as a result of lower sales 
our expense provision for obsolete inventories totaled  in compared to  in our cost of sales includes both variable and fixed cost components 
the variable component consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs and warranty costs 
the fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases  and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases  as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases  and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases  as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes 
table of contents increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
the following is an analysis of our commercial product gross profit margins for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net commercial product sales cost of commercial product sales gross profit we had a negative gross margin of million in from the sale of our commercial products compared to a negative gross margin of million in the negative gross margin in was primarily because the reduced level of commercial sales was insufficient to cover our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in and a similar charge of  in gross margins were favorably impacted by  in by the sale of previously written off inventory 
there was no similar benefit in we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors  including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
cost of government and other contract revenue totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
because these contracts are generally priced on a cost plus basis  declines in revenue generally result in declines in associated costs 
as a percentage of government revenue  government and other contract expenses decreased from in to in because of different cost recognition criteria on one of our cost plus contracts 
research and development expenses relate to development of new products  including our wireless commercial products 
these expenses also include design expenses associated with reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of our existing products 
research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is the result of new commercial products development effort 
we have relatively fixed engineering resources  and our research and development expenses vary inversely with the amount of those resources allocated to our government contract activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or

consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to the completion of the first phase of a major contract and a funding gap before the second phase of that contract was funded in our second quarter and increased efforts on our research and development activities

the lower expenses in resulted primarily from a reduction in employees in the fourth quarter of  as well as lower expenses for insurance and consulting 

table of contents other expense included a loss from our joint venture with baoli in china of  the loss included a  expense for impairment and a  expense for our percent equity ownership of the joint venture s operating loss 
the adjustment of the fair value expense represents the treatment  as a derivative  of  warrants that are exercisable for common stock

we currently invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade  money market instruments with maturities of three months or less 
our investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  in  cash was used principally in operations and to a lesser extent for the purchase of property and equipment 
these uses were partially offset by net cash proceeds of million provided by the sales of common stock 
cash used in operations totaled million in we used million to fund the cash portion of our net loss 
we also used cash to fund a  increase in accounts payable payments and patents and licenses payments 
these uses were offset by cash generated from the sale of inventory  lower accounts receivable  lower prepaid expenses and lower other assets totaling  net cash used in investing activities  which was for the purchase of fixed assets  totaled  in net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
cash from the sale of common stock was million  net of approximately  in expenses  from the sale of million shares of common stock at per share in august and october in january we repurchased  of our common shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations due from our employees upon the vesting of their restricted stock awards 
financing activities we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash on hand  equipment lease financings  available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public equity offerings 
financing activities from the sale of our common stock in august and october of totaled million  net of  in expenses  from the sale of million shares of our common stock at per share 
as described in future liquidity  in a registered direct offering completed in february we raised proceeds of million  net of offering costs of  from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share based on a negotiated discount to market 
we have an existing line of credit from a bank 
the line of credit expires in july the loan agreement is structured as a sale of our accounts receivable and provides for the sale of up to million of eligible accounts 
table of contents receivable  with advances to us totaling of the receivables sold 
advances bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  plus subject to a minimum monthly charge 
advances are collateralized by a lien on all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we continue to service the sold receivables and are subject to recourse provisions 
there was no amount outstanding under this borrowing facility at december  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
they consist of the following operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations consist of a facility lease in santa barbara  california and several smaller equipment leases 
patents and licenses 
we have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments ranging from to of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments 
in the normal course of business  we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period and and and contractual obligations total beyond operating leases minimum license commitment fixed asset and inventory purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations capital expenditures we plan to invest approximately million in fixed assets during future liquidity in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit reports for through an explanatory paragraph expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december  we had million in cash 
our cash resources  together with our line of credit  may not be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
we believe the key factors to our future liquidity will be our ability to successfully use our expertise and our technology to generate revenues in various ways  including commercial operations  government contracts  joint ventures and licenses 
because of the uncertainty of these factors  we may need to raise funds to meet our working capital needs 
see note 
table of contents in a registered direct offering completed in february we raised proceeds of million  net of offering costs of  from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share based on a negotiated discount to market 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise any needed funds  we might be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts  million and million  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
however  during management concluded that under the internal revenue code change of control limitations  a maximum of million and million  respectively  would be available for reduction of taxable income  and reduced both the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance accordingly 
included in the net operating loss carryforwards are deductions related to stock options of approximately million and million for federal and california income tax purposes  respectively 
to the extent net operating loss carryforwards are recognized for accounting purposes  the resulting benefits related to the stock options will be credited to stockholders equity 
in addition  we had research and development and other tax credits for state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which expire in the years and due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal funds rate  as defined in the internal revenue code and the value of the corporation at the time of a change of ownership as defined by section we had changes in ownership in august  december and june in addition  we acquired the right to conductus net operating losses  which are also subject to the limitations imposed by section conductus underwent four ownership changes  which occurred in february  february  december and june therefore  the ability to utilize conductus and our net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to annual limitation upon utilization in future periods 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes 
our money market investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 
at december   we had approximately million invested in a money market account yielding approximately 
assuming no yield on this money market account and no liquidation of principal for the year  our total interest income would decrease by approximately  per annum 
as we had no amounts outstanding on our bank loan during  changes in its interest rate would not have affected us 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  recovery of long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contract revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory 
such provisions are established based on historical usage  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products  net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted 
we indemnify  without limit or term  our customers against all claims  suits  demands  damages  liabilities  expenses  judgments  settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products 
we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our indemnities because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total 
contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts 
contract revenues are recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
if the current contract estimate were to indicate a loss  utilizing the funded amount of the contract  a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss 
contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the united states government 
credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal 
these contracts include cost plus  fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short term in nature 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the defense contract audit agency 
based on historical experience and review of current projects in process  we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the defense contract audit agency has audited us through 
table of contents we periodically evaluate the realizability of long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
long lived assets that will no longer be used in our business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
in the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets  the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
our future cash flows may vary from estimates 
stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all awards granted on or after the beginning of we issue stock option awards and restricted share awards to employees and to non employee directors under our stock based incentive plans 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation cost related to restricted share awards is recorded based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we recognize compensation expense over the expected vesting period on a straight line basis from the grant date 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods 
if and when we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years
