all amounts are expressed in us dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts but reflect our current expectation regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in this report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
overview we are a leading provider of integrated communications solutions focused on the sme market 
we also have a strong and growing presence in the large enterprise market with a portfolio of products that support up to  users 
our ip based communications solutions consist of a combination of ip telephony platforms  which we deliver as software  appliances and desktop devices  and a suite of ucc applications that integrate voice  video and data communications with business applications 
we believe that our solutions  including associated managed and network services  enable our customers to realize significant cost benefits and to conduct their business more effectively 
we have delivered innovative communications solutions to our customers for over years  initially through mitel corporation  our predecessor business 
we have invested heavily in the research and development r d of our ip based communications solutions to take advantage of the telecommunications industry shift from traditional pbx systems to ip based communications solutions 
we believe our early and sustained r d investment in ip based communications solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on the industry shift to ip based communications solutions 
as a result of this strategic focus  for the last four years substantially all of our system shipments have been ip based communication solutions 
significant events and recent developments in fiscal august  we completed the acquisition of inter tel  which significantly enhanced our ability to target sme customers with our ip solutions by expanding our us distribution and managed service capabilities 
the total purchase price of million was funded with a combination of equity and debt financing plus cash held by inter tel 
in april  we completed an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq global market 
under the ipo  we sold million common shares at per share 
our net proceeds from the ipo were million after underwriting commissions of million and other associated costs of million 
the net proceeds of the ipo were used to repay million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million to prepay amounts outstanding under our first lien term loan  with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes 
in conjunction with the ipo  all of the million class preferred shares were converted into common shares 
until the end of the second quarter of fiscal  the company leased its ottawa based headquarter facilities from the matthews group under a year lease which was to expire in february during the third quarter of fiscal  the company negotiated a new lease with the matthews group under terms and conditions which management believes reflect current market rates 
the new lease has a term of years and months  and can be renewed at the option of the company for an additional years 
in march  we made a prepayment of million against our outstanding first lien term loan 
in connection with the prepayment  the maximum consolidated debt to ebitda covenant under our first lien credit agreement was increased for the fourth quarter of fiscal and for subsequent quarters up to and including the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we announced changes to our senior management team 
in january  richard mcbee became our new chief executive officer ceo  following the retirement of don smith 
mr 
smith continues to serve as a director of mitel 
in addition  mr 
mcbee has taken on the role of president following the departure of paul butcher  our former president and chief operating officer  in april the chief operating officer title has been eliminated 
in may  we announced certain organizational changes  creating an organization comprised of two geographical sales organizations and three key business units 
we anticipate that these organizational changes will result in a change in our segmented presentation  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal operating results our total revenues for the year ended april  were million  as compared to million for the year ended april  the increase in revenues is due to an increase in sales from our network services segment 
our operating income 
table of contents decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in operating income was largely due to an increase in special charges resulting from restructuring activity during the year and an increase in sales  general and administrative sg a expenses and r d expenses as a result of the phase out of the reduced work week program  as described below 
in fiscal and  our operating results were affected by the global economic recession  which started in mid calendar year our fiscal 
we responded to the negative effect of the recession by implementing cost reduction programs to re align our operating model 
these programs  which were implemented during the second half of fiscal and fiscal  included headcount reductions  reduced discretionary spending  closure of excess facilities across our geographic regions and renegotiation of key supplier contracts 
in fiscal  we implemented a temporary reduced work week program  which remained in effect throughout fiscal the reduced work week program was phased out gradually in fiscal while our revenues declined as a result of the economic conditions  our cost reduction programs contributed positively to our operating performance  resulting in a significant improvement in both operating income and adjusted ebitda in fiscal as compared to fiscal we plan to continue to monitor our cost structure so that it remains appropriate for our revenue levels 
depending on the future macroeconomic climate and its impact on our revenues  we may implement additional cost reduction programs in an effort to keep operating expenses in line with revenues 
conversely  if our revenues improve above current levels we may gradually increase our expenditures while ensuring that our operating expense to revenue ratio remains within our target level 
in either scenario  we plan to continue to invest in new product development and other significant r d initiatives 
however  there is no certainty that these investments will allow us to develop and introduce new ip based communications solutions in a timely manner to allow us to compete effectively against existing and new competitors and meet customer requirements 
trends businesses are migrating from legacy telephony networks to ip based environments  which can address their voice  data  video and business applications requirements within a single converged network 
the transition to ip based communications solutions provides significant benefits to businesses  including enhanced workforce productivity  reduced infrastructure costs  the creation of highly functional applications that can be distributed easily  and the use of open standards 
we have invested heavily and continue to innovate in ip based solutions and therefore believe we are well positioned to benefit from this transition 
the evolution to converged ip based networks has given rise to two important trends the transition from hardware based to software based communications solutions and the ability to deliver integrated ucc applications 
the transition to software based communications solutions provides operational cost benefits and the ability to integrate communications with other business processes and applications 
ucc allows business customers to move beyond basic fixed telephony and disparate communications tools toward integrated multi media communications and collaboration between users  wherever they may be located 
ucc includes the integrated use of various media and messaging  such as voice  video and data 
our history of success as an early adopter in software based communications solutions has provided us with the foundation for continued innovation in ip based communications and ucc 
we believe our comprehensive  integrated ip based communications offering provides our customers with significant flexibility  cost efficiency and enhanced employee productivity as they transition to converged ip based environments and ucc 
corporate data centers have experienced a significant increase in the use of virtualization technology as a strategy to reduce capital and operating expenses as well as providing improved business continuity solutions through new high availability architectures 
virtualization technology is also serving as the base for both private and public cloud computing solutions enabling businesses to benefit from data center outsourcing and data center elasticity where data center resources may be acquired and dispensed with  depending on a business s needs 
we believe that businesses can significantly benefit from the virtualization of all ucc and ip based communication solutions by allowing these products to integrate fully with the data center infrastructure and related management processes and eliminating telecommunication specific infrastructure and processes 
our early investment in this technology across our product portfolio allows our customers to benefit using either our products on vmware or with our micd product 
smes are increasingly interested in outsourcing management of their communications requirements through managed service offerings 
managed services may include equipment  installation  ongoing support  network services  or various professional services 
managed services offerings allow businesses to focus on their core expertise and  in some cases  substitute what would otherwise be a large capital expenditure for a predictable operating expense 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend through the combination of our existing managed service program and our network services offerings in the united states 
we believe these solutions also provide an opportunity to achieve operational savings by giving us the flexibility to place equipment and services either on the customer s premises or as a hosted solution 

table of contents key performance indicators key performance indicators that we use to manage our business and evaluate our financial results and operating performance include revenues  gross margins  operating costs  operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and adjusted ebitda 
revenue performance is evaluated from both a geographical perspective  in accordance with our reportable segments  and from a revenue source perspective  that is telecommunications and network services 
we evaluate revenue performance by comparing the results to management forecasts and prior period performance 
gross margins  operating costs  operating income loss and net income loss are each evaluated in a similar manner as our actual results are compared against both management forecasts and prior period performance 
cash flow from operations is the key performance indicator with respect to cash flows 
as part of monitoring cash flow from operations  we also monitor our days sales outstanding  our inventory turns and our days expenses in payables outstanding 
adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  is evaluated by comparing actual results to management forecasts and prior period performance 
for a definition and explanation of adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  see item  selected financial data 
in addition to the above indicators  from time to time  we also monitor performance in the following areas status of key customer contracts  the achievement of expected milestones of our key r d projects  and the achievement of our key strategic initiatives 
in an effort to ensure we are creating value for and maintaining strong relationships with our customers  we monitor the status of key customer contracts to monitor customer service levels 
with respect to our r d projects  we measure content  quality and timeliness against project plans 
sources of revenues and expenses the following describes our sources of revenues and expenses 
revenues we generate our revenues principally from the sale of integrated communications solutions to business customers  with these revenues being classified as telecommunications revenues or network services revenues 
telecommunications revenues are comprised of revenues generated from the sales of platforms  including software  appliances and desktop devices  ucc applications and managed services 
network services are comprised of local and long distance and network resale services 
our distribution network includes value added resellers  service providers  high touch sales and direct channel 
we complement and support our channel partners in selected markets using a sales model whereby our sales staff works either directly with a prospective customer or in coordination with a channel partner in defining the scope  design and implementation of the solution 
our direct and indirect distribution channel addresses the needs of customers in over countries through our offices and more than  channel partners worldwide 
because we have multiple revenue streams  our revenue recognition policy varies depending on the revenue stream and type of customer transaction 
revenue for hardware is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for software arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value or the residual method  as applicable  and using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is based on prices charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue related to post contract support pcs  including technical support and unspecified when and if available software upgrades  is recognized ratably over the pcs term for contracts that are greater than one year 
for contracts where the post contract period is one year or less  the costs are deemed insignificant and the unspecified software upgrades are expected to 
table of contents be and historically have been infrequent  revenue is recognized together with the initial licensing fee and the estimated costs are accrued 
we make sales to resellers and channel partners based on contracts that typically expire at the end of our fiscal year  with automatic renewals for one year periods thereafter 
for products sold through these distribution channels  revenues are recognized at the time the risk of loss is transferred to resellers and channel partners according to contractual terms and if all contractual obligations have been satisfied 
these arrangements usually involve multiple elements  including pcs and training 
costs related to insignificant technical support obligations  including second line phone support for certain products  are accrued 
for other technical support and training obligations  revenues from product sales are allocated to each element based on vsoe of relative fair values  generally representing the prices charged when the element is sold separately  with any discount allocated proportionately 
revenues attributable to undelivered elements are deferred and recognized upon performance or ratably over the contract period 
our standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale and extended warranty periods are offered on certain products 
at the time product revenues are recognized  an accrual for estimated warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues based on prior claims experience 
sales to our channel partners do not provide for return or price protection rights while sales to distributors provide for these rights 
product return rights for distributors are typically limited to a percentage of sales over a maximum three month period 
a reserve for estimated product returns and price protection rights based on past experience is recorded as a reduction of sales at the time product revenues are recognized 
for new resellers  we estimate the product return provision using past return experience with similar partners operating in the same regions 
we offer various cooperative marketing programs to assist our channels to market our products 
allowances for these programs are recorded as marketing expenses at the time of shipment based on contract terms and prior claims experience 
we also sell solutions  including installation and related maintenance and support services  directly to end user customers 
for solutions sold directly to end user customers  revenues are recognized at the time of delivery and at the time risk of loss is transferred  based on prior experience of successful compliance with customer specifications 
revenues from installation are recognized when services are rendered and when contractual obligations  including customer acceptance  have been satisfied 
revenues are also derived from professional service contracts with terms that typically range from two to six weeks for standard solutions and for longer periods for customized solutions 
revenues from customer support  professional services and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period  generally one year 
billings in advance of services are included in deferred revenues 
revenues from installation services provided in advance of billing are included in unbilled accounts receivable 
certain arrangements with end user customers provide customer support and maintenance services extending months from the date of installation at no charge 
customer support and maintenance contracts are also sold separately 
when customer support or maintenance services are provided at no charge  these amounts are unbundled from the product and installation revenues at their fair market value based on the prices charged when the element is sold separately and recognized ratably over the contract period 
consulting and training revenues are recognized upon performance 
we provide long term outsourcing services of communication systems 
under these arrangements  systems management services managed services and communication equipment are provided to end user customers typically over a five year period 
revenues from managed services are recognized ratably over the contract period 
we retain title and risk of loss associated with the equipment utilized in the provision of the managed services 
accordingly  the equipment is capitalized as part of property and equipment and is amortized to cost of sales over the contract period 
in a transaction containing a sales type lease  hardware revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the hardware lease element at the time of system sale in accordance with the leases topic of the united states financial accounting standards board accounting standard codification fasb asc 
with respect to the software lease elements included in the sales type lease  which are comprised of software  including applications  upgrades  software support  and embedded software  prior to the company establishing vsoe for these elements  revenues from the software elements were deferred and recognized over the period of support in accordance with the software topic of the fasb asc 
where the company has now established vsoe for these elements  revenue is recognized upon delivery  based on their vsoe  in accordance with the software topic of the fasb asc 
revenues from sales type leases are allocated between hardware and software elements based on management s best estimate of relative fair values 
we regularly sell the net rental payments from sales type leases to financial institutions with the income streams discounted at prevailing rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from leases are recorded as net sales within telecommunications revenues 
we also provide network services to our customers  which includes local and long distance voice services  internet access and data network offerings on our partners networks  which we bill on a monthly basis 
revenues from network services are recognized as the services are provided 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues is comprised of product costs and service costs 
product cost of revenues is primarily comprised of cost of goods purchased from third party electronics manufacturing services and inventory provisions  engineering costs  warranty costs and other supply chain management costs 
product cost of revenues also includes a small component related to software comprised of royalty payments and licensing fees to third parties 
service cost of sales is primarily comprised of costs associated with managed services  which include labor costs associated with maintenance and support  installation and other professional services  and costs associated with network services  which includes the cost of acquisition of local and long distance voice services  internet access and data network services from major carriers in the united states 
depreciation of property and equipment relating to cost of revenues are also included in cost of revenues expense 
we use high volume contract manufacturers and component suppliers and we require them to give us full visibility of component supply  manufacturing process and portability 
we measure and benchmark the performance of our component suppliers and manufacturers for technical innovation  financial strength  quality  support and operational effectiveness 
sales  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses consist primarily of costs relating to our sales and marketing activities  including salaries and related expenses  advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities and materials  administrative and finance functions  legal and professional fees  insurance and other corporate and overhead expenses 
following the acquisition of inter tel in fiscal  sg a also includes significant amounts recorded for the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
research and development expenses r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  materials and consumables and subcontract service costs 
depreciation and amortization of r d assets are included in r d expenses 
special charges and restructuring costs special charges relate to restructuring activities  product line exits and other loss accruals undertaken to improve our operational efficiency 
special charges consist primarily of workforce reduction costs  lease termination obligations and asset write offs 
we reassess the accruals at each reporting period to reflect changes in the timing or amount of estimated restructuring and termination costs on which the original estimates were based 
new restructuring accruals or reversals of previous accruals are recorded in the period of change 
comparability of periods our functional currency is the us dollar and our consolidated financial statements are prepared with us dollar reporting currency using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities of non us operations are translated from foreign currencies into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenue and expense items are translated at the monthly weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period 
the resulting unrealized gains and losses have been included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported as other comprehensive income 
as a result  changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period can have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position  which also makes the comparability of periods complex 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table sets forth our comparative results of operations  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  for fiscal and fiscal year ended april  change amounts of revenue amounts of revenue amount in millions  except percentages revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development special charges and restructuring costs loss gain on litigation settlement operating income interest expense debt retirement costs  including write off of related deferred financing costs fair value adjustment on derivative instruments other income income tax recovery net income adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure the comparison is not meaningful 
revenues our reportable segments are represented by the following four geographic sales regions the united states  europe  middle east africa collectively emea  canada and caribbean latin america collectively canada and cala  and asia pacific 
these reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our management views and evaluates our business 
the following table sets forth total revenues by geographic regions both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended april  change revenues of revenues revenues of revenues amount in millions  except percentages telecommunications revenues united states emea canada and cala asia pacific 
table of contents fiscal year ended april  change revenues of revenues revenues of revenues amount in millions  except percentages network services revenues united states our telecommunications revenues in fiscal remained consistent with fiscal as decreased revenues in the us and emea were largely offset by increased revenue in the asia pacific region 
our network services revenues increased  however  due to an increased spend per customer compared to fiscal telecommunications revenues in the us decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that the decrease in telecommunications revenues was primarily due to the lower sales from direct selling offices 
revenues in emea decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of the global recession and the weakening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar 
as approximately of this region s revenues are generated in currencies other than the us dollar  most significantly the british pound sterling and the euro  our revenues  as reported in us dollars  are impacted by significant changes in exchange rates 
revenues in the emea region decreased due to a lower average exchange rate of the british pound sterling during fiscal versus fiscal excluding the impact of foreign exchange  revenues in emea were down principally as a result of lower volumes through our channel partners in europe 
revenues in canada and cala increased by  or  million in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven primarily by the higher average exchange rate of the canadian dollar during fiscal versus fiscal revenues in asia pacific increased by million  or  due to strong performance in the south pacific as we continue our efforts to grow the business in the region 
networks services revenues in the us increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from network services in fiscal was due to increased spending per customer compared to the prior period 
gross margin the following table sets forth gross margin  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  for the fiscal years indicated fiscal year ended april  gross margin gross margin gross margin gross margin in millions  except percentages telecommunications network services total gross margin percentage declined by to in fiscal from in fiscal  driven by a decrease from telecommunications 
gross margin percentage on telecommunication revenues decreased in fiscal by to from in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of an unfavorable shift in revenue mix coupled with unfavorable changes in the foreign exchange rates 
the declines in margin were partially offset by a reduction in costs due to improved prices from our contract manufacturers 

table of contents network services typically generate lower gross margins as compared to sales of software and systems 
the gross margin percentage from our network services revenues improved to in fiscal from in fiscal predominantly as the result of lower rates negotiated with our local and long distance carriers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal we expect gross margins to improve slightly in the near term as a result of continuing implementation of our cost reduction initiatives described above and trend to higher margin software products  however  margins could be higher or lower as a result of a number of factors including variations in revenue mix  competitive pricing pressures  foreign currency movements in regions where revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  utilization of our professional services personnel and efficiencies in installing our products  and global economic conditions  among other factors 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to of revenues in fiscal from of revenues in fiscal an increase of million in absolute dollars 
our sg a expenses for fiscal included certain non cash charges  most significantly million million for the amortization of customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets related to the acquisition of inter tel in fiscal in addition  sg a included million million of non cash compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percent of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher selling and marketing expenses  higher stock based compensation and the phase out of the reduced work week program  which began in july we will continue to monitor our cost base closely in an effort to keep our operating expenditures in line with revenue levels achieved in future quarters 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues is highly dependent on revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved 
research and development r d expenses increased to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of million in absolute dollars 
the increase in our investment level in r d in fiscal was due to the phase out of the reduced work week program in fiscal we have historically invested heavily in r d  consistent with an aggressive r d investment strategy that has positioned us with a broad range of feature rich  scalable  standards based and interoperable ip based communication solutions 
our r d expenses in absolute dollars can fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development initiatives in any given quarter 
r d expenses as a percentage of revenues is highly dependent on revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved 
special charges and restructuring costs we recorded pre tax special charges of million in fiscal as a result of actions taken to lower our operating cost structure 
the components of the special charges consisted of million of employee severance and benefits incurred in the termination of approximately employees around the world and million related to additional lease terminations and accreted interest on lease terminations 
we expect all of the workforce reduction liability to be settled within the next two years 
the lease termination obligations incurred in the current and prior fiscal years will be reduced over the remaining term of the leases  with million of the outstanding million balance to be paid in fiscal we recorded pre tax special charges of million in fiscal as a result of actions taken to lower our operating cost structure 
the components of the special charges included million of employee severance and benefits incurred in the termination of approximately employees around the world  million related to additional lease terminations and accreted interest on lease terminations  and million in assets written off related to the termination of a product line 
substantially all of the workforce reduction liability at april  was settled in fiscal also included in special charges in fiscal was million of costs related to integration activities following our acquisition of inter tel 

table of contents we may take additional restructuring actions in the future to reduce our operating expenses and gain operating efficiencies 
the timing and potential amount of such actions will depend on several factors  including future revenue levels and opportunities for operating efficiencies identified by management 
litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our estimate of the expected payments under our litigation settlements and recorded a million charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded pre tax income of million primarily related to a settlement of litigation  as described in the results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal  below 
operating income loss we reported operating income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in operating income was due primarily due to an increase in sg a and r d expenses largely the result of the phase out of the reduced work week program  an increase in special charges and restructuring costs and an increased litigation settlement expense  as described above 
non operating expenses interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our interest expense relates predominantly to two credit agreements bearing interest based on libor that were entered into to finance a portion of the inter tel acquisition in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to lower debt balances as well as a lower effective interest rate 
in april  we used a portion of the proceeds from our ipo to repay the million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and prepaid million of our first lien term loan 
in march  we prepaid an additional million of our first lien term loan 
in connection with such prepayment  the maximum consolidated debt to ebitda covenant under our credit agreement governing the first lien term loan was increased for the fourth quarter of fiscal and for subsequent quarters up to and including the second quarter of fiscal we did not draw any amounts on our revolving credit facility during fiscal the lower average long term debt balance resulted in approximately million of the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal the remainder of the decrease was due to a lower average libor  on which the interest expense on our debt is based  coupled with the expiry of an interest rate swap agreement where we had fixed a portion of our interest expense 
the fixed rate under the interest rate swap agreement was higher than the variable rate  libor 
the interest rate swap agreement expired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and was not renewed or replaced upon expiry 
for fiscal  we paid an average libor rate of fiscal  excluding the unfavorable swap agreement 
our interest expense will fluctuate from period to period depending on the movement in the libor 
debt and warrant retirement costs  including write off of related deferred costs 
in april  we prepaid million of our outstanding first lien term loan  at par 
as a result  we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing charges representing a pro rata portion of the unamortized deferred charges related to the first lien term loan 
in march  we prepaid an additional million of our outstanding first lien term loan  at par 
as a result  we expensed million of unamortized deferred financing charges and of related expenses 
fair value adjustment on derivative instruments in fiscal  the fair value adjustment on derivative instruments consists of the mark to mark adjustment on warrants that have an exercise price in canadian dollars 
as a result of derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb asc  we are required to record an adjustment for the change in fair value of our warrants that are denominated in a currency canadian dollars other than our functional currency 
at april   these warrants had a fair value of million 
in fiscal  these warrants expired out of the money 
as a result  we recorded the million change in fair value as income during fiscal in fiscal  the fair value adjustment on derivative instruments consists of two items  the mark to market adjustment on the embedded derivative in the class preferred shares and the mark to mark adjustment on the warrants that have an exercise price in canadian dollars 
the holders of class preferred shares  issued in connection with the acquisition of inter tel  had the right to redeem the preferred shares and receive cash equal to the value of our common shares into which the instrument would convert after seven years 

table of contents as a portion of the redemption price of the preferred shares was indexed to our common share price  an embedded derivative was accounted for separately and was marked to market in each reporting period 
in april  in conjunction with the ipo  the preferred shares were converted 
as a result  a mark to market non cash gain of million was recorded in fiscal for the year ended april   due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our common stock as a result of the ipo  we recorded a loss of million for the fair value adjustment on warrants that had an exercise price in canadian dollars 
these warrants expired in april other income in fiscal  other income was million compared to million during fiscal other income in both fiscal years consisted of interest income and amortization of the deferred gain on sale of land and building in the uk in fiscal  partially offset by a foreign exchange loss 
income tax recovery in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
based on a number of factors  including completion of a reorganization of certain subsidiaries  cumulative income for the previous months and forecasted income excluding non recurring items  we determined that it was now more likely than not that the company would realize a benefit from a significant portion of its deferred tax assets in canada 
as a result  we relieved a valuation allowance of million primarily relating to the deferred tax assets in canada 
future changes in estimates of taxable income could result in a significant change to the valuation allowance 
at april   there continues to be a valuation allowance of against deferred tax assets  primarily in canada and the united kingdom 
during fiscal  there was no change in the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
at april  we concluded that a substantial valuation allowance was appropriate due to the uncertainty surrounding the company s ability to earn taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
excluding changes in valuation allowance  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the fiscal tax recovery was due primarily to the use of losses not previously recognized  which was partially offset by the tax effect of temporary differences  related to differences in accounting and tax treatment pertaining primarily to the leasing portfolio and other accruals 
the fiscal tax benefit primarily resulted from a benefit of timing differences in accounting and tax treatment pertaining primarily to the leasing portfolio and other accruals  which more than offset the expected tax expense on our pre tax income at statutory rates 
net income in fiscal  our net income was driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance  as described above 
excluding taxes  our net income decreased from fiscal due to a non recurring fair value adjustment of million recorded in fiscal  coupled with lower operating income  as described above 
this was partially offset by lower interest expense during the year 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a million  or decrease 
this decrease in adjusted ebitda was driven by lower gross margin  as well as the effect of the phase out of the reduced work week program  which began in july for a definition and explanation of adjusted ebitda as well a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  see item  selected financial data

fiscal year ended april  change in millions  except percentages revenues of revenues revenues of revenues amount telecommunications network services revenues in fiscal decreased to million compared to million in fiscal  with telecommunications revenues decreasing to million from million and network revenues increasing to million from million 
our revenues in fiscal and fiscal were adversely affected by the global recession 
in the weakened economic climate  many of our existing and prospective customers reduced their capital expenditures or delayed new equipment purchases  which resulted in lower telecommunications revenues 
our revenues from network services increased  however  due to an increase in both the number of active customers and the number of services we billed to those customers compared to fiscal 
table of contents geographic segment revenues our reportable segments are represented by the following four geographic sales regions the united states  emea  canada and cala  and asia pacific 
these reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our management views and evaluates our business

we believe that the decrease in telecommunications revenues was primarily due to the weakened economic climate in the united states  which adversely affected consumer demand 
the increase in revenues from network services in fiscal was due to an increase in the number of customers and the number of services we billed to those customers compared to the prior periods 
revenues in emea decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of the global recession and the weakening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar 
as approximately of this region s revenues are generated in currencies other than the us dollar  most significantly the british pound sterling and the euro  our revenues  as reported in us dollars  are impacted by significant changes in exchange rates 
revenues in the region decreased year over year  of which was attributed to the effects of the recession which reduced revenues across all regions  with the remainder of the decrease due to a lower average exchange rate of the british pound sterling during fiscal versus fiscal revenues in canada and cala decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the global recession 
revenues in asia pacific remained stable during fiscal gross margin the following table sets forth gross margin  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  for the fiscal years indicated fiscal year ended april  gross margin gross margin gross margin gross margin in millions  except percentages telecommunications network services total gross margin percentage improved in fiscal  increasing by to from in fiscal the decline in revenues in fiscal as a result of the global recession was offset by lower costs to sell our products 
lower costs were driven by lower labor and other overhead charges resulting from headcount and salary reductions 
these cost saving actions and an increase in sales of higher margin products aided in maintaining our gross margin as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents gross margin percentage on telecommunication revenues increased in fiscal by to from in fiscal this increase in gross margin was primarily the result of initiatives we undertook commencing in the latter half of fiscal to streamline product costs and lower our overall cost of sales 
these initiatives included renegotiating supply agreements to reduce product costs  reductions in headcount and salaries to better align labor and overhead costs with current market demand  improved inventory management to lower our excess and obsolete inventories and other general cost saving measures 
network services typically generate lower gross margins as compared to sales of software and systems 
the gross margin percentage from our network services revenues improved to in fiscal from in fiscal predominantly as a result of lower rates negotiated with our local and long distance carriers 
operating expenses research and development r d expenses decreased to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal  a decrease of million in absolute dollars 
the decrease in r d expenses is primarily due to reductions in headcount and salaries and other cost saving measures implemented during the year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of revenues in fiscal from of revenues in fiscal a decrease of million in absolute dollars 
the decrease was a result of proactive cost cutting measures undertaken during the latter half of fiscal and fiscal  most notably reductions in headcount and salaries and consolidation of facilities across the globe 
our sg a expenditures for fiscal included certain non cash charges  most significantly million million for the amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships  developed technology and trade name  primarily related to the acquisition of inter tel 
in addition  sg a included million million of non cash compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
special charges  integration and merger related expenses we recorded pre tax special charges of million in fiscal as a result of actions taken to lower our operating cost structure 
the components of the special charges included million of employee severance and benefits incurred in the termination of approximately employees around the world  million of accreted interest related to lease termination obligations  million related to additional lease terminations in the period and million in assets written off related to the termination of a product line 
payment of workforce reduction liabilities is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal the lease termination obligations incurred in the current and prior fiscal years will be reduced over the remaining term of the leases  with million of the outstanding million balance to be paid in fiscal also included in special charges was million of costs related to integration activities following our acquisition of inter tel 
litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded pre tax income of million primarily related to a settlement of litigation 
upon the acquisition of inter tel in august  the company assumed liability for a lawsuit brought forward by certain former independent distributors of products of a manufacturing company whose partial assets were purchased by inter tel in the lawsuit asserted that inter tel was liable for  among other things  breaches of the underlying dealer agreements between the plaintiffs and the seller 
in april  we negotiated a settlement with the plaintiffs in this suit  which included a cash payment to the plaintiffs 
the difference between the initial provision and the settlement was recorded as income in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment of goodwill in accordance with gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to marketplace participants to corroborate the results of the calculated fair value 
under the income approach  discounted cash flows for each reporting unit are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
we generally use the average of the results under the two approaches as the fair value of the reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million on the goodwill initially recorded as part of the inter tel acquisition 
due to the economic downturn and its impact on consumer spending  we lowered our expected cash flow 
table of contents forecasts and this  combined with significantly lower market multiples as a result of the general decline in global capital markets  resulted in a decline in the fair value of our us reporting unit 
accordingly  the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal this non cash goodwill impairment charge did not affect our liquidity  cash flows or future operations 
operating income loss we reported operating income of million in fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss was driven by the million impairment of goodwill  as described above 
absent the impairment of goodwill  our fiscal results would have shown operating income of million 
despite the effect of the recession on our sales  operating income increased in fiscal as a result of proactive measures we undertook to control expenses and achieve operational efficiencies in our business 
in addition the lower level of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal coupled with the litigation settlement gain drove a portion of the increase in operating income 
non operating expenses interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our interest expense relates predominantly to two credit agreements bearing interest based on libor that were entered into to finance a portion of the inter tel acquisition in fiscal the decrease in interest is due to a lower average libor during the year  coupled with the expiry during the year of an interest rate swap agreement 
in august we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively swapped the libor rate for a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million for the period from october to october the agreement was not renewed or replaced upon expiry 
as a result  for a portion of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter of fiscal  our interest expense was recorded based solely on libor  plus a margin  rather than a portion of the interest expense being recorded at the swap rate  plus a margin 
for fiscal  libor ranged from to versus a range of to during fiscal in april  using a portion of the proceeds from our ipo  we repaid million on our revolving credit facility and prepaid million of our first lien term loan 
as the payments occurred at the end of the fiscal year  the repayments did not have a significant effect on the interest expense for fiscal debt and warrant retirement costs  including write off of related deferred costs 
in april  we prepaid million of our outstanding first lien term loan  at par 
as a result  we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing charges representing a pro rata portion of the unamortized deferred charges related to the first lien term loan 
no prepayments were made in fiscal fair value adjustment on derivative instruments fair value adjustment on derivative instruments consists of two items in fiscal  the mark to market adjustment on the embedded derivative in the class preferred shares and the mark to mark adjustment on the warrants that have an exercise price in canadian dollars 
the holders of class preferred shares had the right to redeem them and receive cash equal to the value of our common shares into which the instrument would convert after seven years 
as a portion of the redemption price of the preferred shares was indexed to our common share price  an embedded derivative was accounted for separately and was marked to market in each reporting period 
in april  in conjunction with the ipo  the preferred shares were converted 
as a result  a mark to market non cash gain of million was recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a non cash gain of million representing the mark to market adjustment on the derivative liability embedded in the class preferred shares 
as a result of adopting the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasbasc on may   we were required to record an adjustment for the change in fair value of our warrants that are denominated in a currency canadian dollars other than our functional currency 
for the year ended april   we recorded a loss of million  due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our common stock as a result of the ipo 
no mark to market adjustment was recorded in the prior year as the standard was not required to be adopted at that time 
other income expense other income expense  on a net basis  consists of foreign exchange rate losses  interest income and amortization of the deferred gain on sale of the united kingdom land and building in fiscal other income  on a net basis  amounted to million 
table of contents of income in fiscal compared to million of expense during fiscal the million increase in other income was driven by lower foreign exchange losses recorded in fiscal as a result of a more stable foreign exchange rates on fiscal transactions than on fiscal transactions 
the lower foreign exchange loss was partially offset by a decrease in interest income caused by a decrease in interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded a net income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the net income tax benefit for fiscal reflects a current income tax expense of million  which was more than offset by a deferred income tax benefit of million 
the fiscal current tax expense was a result of taxable income in certain jurisdictions where we do not have net operating loss carry forwards available to offset taxable income 
the fiscal deferred income tax benefit resulted from recognition of net operating losses as well as differences in accounting and tax treatment pertaining primarily to the leasing portfolio and other accruals 
the net income tax benefit for fiscal reflects a current income tax benefit of million and a deferred tax benefit of million resulting from differences in accounting and tax treatment pertaining to revenue recognition  the leasing portfolio and other accruals 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or none of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during fiscal  there was no change in the assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets by entity 
during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million to reflect a change in the valuation allowance because it was determined that it was more likely than not that tax assets in certain subsidiaries would be realized 
net income loss in fiscal  our net income was driven by a number of the factors discussed above 
in particular  despite the effect of the recession on our sales  net income increased in fiscal as a result of proactive measures we undertook to control expenses and achieve operational efficiencies in our business 
in fiscal our net loss was predominantly impacted by the million impairment of goodwill  partially offset by a million gain from fair value adjustments on our embedded derivatives and a million deferred tax benefit 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a million  or improvement 
this improvement in adjusted ebitda  despite the global recession  was driven by proactive cost cutting measures we took during fiscal  from which the full benefit was realized in fiscal  plus additional cost cutting measures taken in early fiscal for a definition and explanation of adjusted ebitda as well a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  see item  selected financial data 
share capital the change in the company s preferred share and common share capital was as follows preferred shares common shares balance  april  accretion on preferred shares other balance  april  accretion on preferred shares amended conversion of preferred shares conversion of preferred shares initial public offering  net of underwriting commissions and costs other balance  april  issue of shares from exercise of options balance  april  in april  we sold million common shares in the ipo at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from the ipo were million after underwriting commissions of million and other associated costs of million 
the net proceeds of 
table of contents the ipo were used to repay million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million to prepay amounts outstanding under the first lien term loan  with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes 
in conjunction with the ipo  all of the million class preferred shares  which were redeemable for cash at the option of the holder in august  were converted into common shares 
the original terms of the class preferred shares included the right of the class preferred share holders to redeem the class preferred shares for their full accreted value in august in addition  the class preferred shares included a conversion feature at the option of the holder 
subsequent to the ipo  had the class preferred shares not converted  the common shares issuable upon conversion would have been the accreted value divided by per share 
the amended terms resulted in conversion of the class preferred shares into common shares based on the accreted value at the time of conversion  per share divided by the ipo offering price of per share 
as the amended terms resulted in a conversion  the difference between the original conversion terms and the amended conversion terms was recorded as million increase to share capital 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   our liquidity consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents of million and an undrawn million revolving facility that matures in august historically  our primary source of funds has been proceeds from financing activities  including the issuance of share capital and long term debt 
at april   we had million of liability outstanding under our credit facilities  consisting of a first lien term loan and second lien term loan and had stated common share capital of million 
we have a defined benefit pension plan in place for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan has been closed to new members since at april   the plan had an unfunded pension liability of million 
the contributions to fund the benefit obligations under this plan are based on actuarial valuations  which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long term operations of the plan  including employee turnover and retirement rates  the performance of the financial markets and interest rates 
the amount of annual employer contributions required to fund the pension deficit annually is determined every three years  in accordance with uk regulations and is based on a calendar year 
in october  the company s annual funding requirement to fund the pension deficit for the calendar year was determined to be million million  and will increase at an annual rate of for the calendar years and in fiscal year  we contributed million million to the uk pension plan for currency service and deficit funding 
we expect to contribute million million in fiscal for current service and deficit funding 
borrowings under the first and second lien term loans are repayable in full on their respective maturity dates 
in addition  the first lien term loan requires annual repayments of million payable in quarterly installments  plus excess annual cash flows as defined in the credit agreement due days after fiscal year end 
we expect to pay approximately million in august relating to the excess cash flows for fiscal proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt  and proceeds from the sale of our assets  may also be required to be used  in whole or in part  to make mandatory prepayments under the first and second lien term loans 
the credit agreements relating to the first and second lien term loans have customary default clauses  wherein repayment of one or more of the credit agreements may be accelerated in the event of an uncured event of default 
each of the credit agreements contains affirmative and negative covenants  including a periodic financial reporting requirements  b maintaining a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt as calculated under our first and second lien credit agreements to consolidated ebitda as calculated under our first and second lien credit agreements as specified in our first and second lien credit agreements  c limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness and also the borrowers themselves  d limitations on liens  e limitations on investments  f limitations on the payment of dividends and g limitations on capital expenditures 
in connection with the march million prepayment  the maximum consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio under the first lien credit agreement was increased for the fourth quarter of fiscal and for subsequent quarters up to and including the second quarter of fiscal as of april   we were in compliance with all of the applicable covenants included in our current credit agreements 
our source for cash in the future is expected to come from existing operations  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which expires in august our most significant source of cash from operations is expected to be the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the sale of future rental payments associated with sales leases which we provide to our customers to finance their purchases as part of our managed services offering program 
the primary use of cash is expected to include funding operating expenses  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and other contractual obligations 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to support our business operations for the next months 
however  we may elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products

in october  the company s annual funding requirement to fund the pension deficit for the calendar year was determined to be million million  and will increase at an annual rate of for calendar years and we expect to contribute million million in fiscal for current service and deficit funding 
future funding requirements after fiscal are highly dependent on the unfunded pension liability and the time period in which the deficit is amortized 
liabilities arising from the remaining unfunded deficit in our defined benefit pension plan are not included in the above table 
as of april   the projected benefit obligation of million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of million  resulting in an unfunded liability of million

obligations arising from r d spending commitments under an agreement  dated as of october   among us  mitel knowledge corporation  march networks and her majesty the queen in right of canada are not included in the above table 
the agreement  as last amended on march   requires us to spend at least of our annual revenues in r d in canada each year  and to make at least of our total r d expenditures in canada each year  until an aggregate of c million worth of r d has been spent in canada since april  purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have the following significant off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit we had million in letters of credit outstanding as of april  april  million 
bid and performance related bonds we enter into bid and performance related bonds related to various customer contracts 
potential payments due under these may be related to our performance and or our channel partners performance under the applicable contract 
the total maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under bid and performance related bonds  excluding letters of credit  was million as of april  april  million 
of this amount  the amount relating to guarantees of our channel partners performance was nil as of april  april  million 
historically  we have not made any payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material payments under these types of bonds 
intellectual property indemnification obligations we enter into agreements on a regular basis with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry 
these obligations generally require us to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions 
the nature of these intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount we could be required to pay to our customers and suppliers 
historically  we have not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these obligations 

table of contents off balance sheet lease obligations we offer our customers lease financing and other services under our managed services offering 
we fund this offering  which we have branded as the totalsolution program  in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
in addition  such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams upon any uncured breach by us under the terms of the underlying sale agreements 
at april   sold payments remaining unbilled net of lease recourse reserves  which represents the total balance of leases that is not included in our balance sheet were million april  million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the determination of estimates requires the use of assumptions and the exercise of judgment and as such actual results could differ from those estimated 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following critical accounting policies are those that we believe require a high level of subjectivity and judgment and have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and the lease recourse liability  provisions for inventory  provisions for product warranties  long lived asset depreciation  goodwill valuation  special charges  contingencies  deferred taxes  pension and post retirement benefits  and the valuation of stock options  warrants and other derivative instruments 
revenue recognition for products sold through our network of wholesale distributors  solution providers  system integrators  authorized channel partners  and other technology providers  arrangements usually involve multiple elements  including post contract technical support and training 
we also sell products and installation and related maintenance and support services directly to customers 
due to the complexity of our sales agreements  judgment is routinely applied principally in the areas of customer acceptance  product returns  unbundling of multiple element arrangements  and collectability 
our sales arrangements frequently include a contractual acceptance provision that specifies certain acceptance criteria and the period in which a product must be accepted or returned 
we make an assessment of whether or not these acceptance criteria will be met by referring to prior experience in successfully complying with customer specifications 
in those cases where experience supports that acceptance will be met  we recognize revenue once delivery is complete  title and risk of loss has passed  the fee is fixed and determinable and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
the provision for estimated sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenues at the time of revenue recognition 
if our estimate of sales returns is too low  additional charges will be incurred in future periods and these additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as a percentage of annual revenues  the provision for sales returns was as of april  compared to as of april  direct revenue sales are comprised of multiple elements which consist of products  maintenance and installation services 
we unbundle these products  maintenance and installation services based on vsoe with any discounts allocated across all elements on a pro rata basis 
collectability is assessed based primarily on the credit worthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as customer payment history 
different judgments or different contract terms could adversely affect the amount and timing of revenues recorded 
sales type leases in a transaction containing a sales type lease  hardware revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the hardware lease element at the time of system sale in accordance with the leases topic of the united states financial accounting standards board accounting standard codification fasb asc 
with respect to the software lease elements included in the sales type lease  which are comprised of software  including applications  upgrades  software support  and embedded software  prior to the company establishing vsoe for these elements  revenues from the software elements were deferred and recognized over the period of support in accordance with the software topic of the fasb asc 
where the company has now established vsoe for these elements  revenue is recognized upon delivery  based on their vsoe  in accordance with the software topic of the fasb asc 
revenues from sales type leases are allocated between hardware and software elements on a relative fair value basis 
the application of the relative fair value allocation method is based on management s best estimate of relative fair values and requires the use of professional judgment in obtaining evidence of fair value for the various elements 

table of contents the costs of systems installed under these sales type leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to financial institutions on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
furthermore  when the initial term of the lease is concluded  customers have the option to renew the lease at a payment and term less than the original lease 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  netted in the current and long term components of net investments in sales type leases on the balance sheet  or  for off balance sheet leases  recorded as a lease recourse liability and included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet 
our total reserve for losses related to the entire lease portfolio  including amounts classified as accounts receivable on our balance sheet was of the ending aggregate lease portfolio as of april  compared to at april  the reserve is based on a review past write off experience and a review of the accounts receivable ageing as of april  we believe our reserves are adequate to cover future potential write offs 
should  however  the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make this assessment including a detailed analysis of the aging of our accounts receivable and the current credit worthiness of our customers and an analysis of historical bad debts and other adjustments 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
we review in detail our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance amount estimate to reflect actual portfolio performance and change in future portfolio performance expectations 
as of april  and april   the provision represented and of gross receivables  respectively 
the decrease in reserve level at april  was due primarily to timing of write offs of accounts receivable in fiscal that were provided for at april  inventory obsolescence in order to record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value  we must assess our inventory valuation  which requires judgment as to future demand 
we adjust our inventory balance based on economic considerations  historical usage  inventory turnover and product life cycles through the recording of a write down which is included in the cost of revenue 
assumptions relating to economic conditions and product life cycle changes are inherently subjective and have a significant impact on the amount of the write down 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory write downs and our gross margin could be adversely affected 

table of contents warranty provision we accrue warranty costs  as part of cost of revenues  based on expected material and labor support costs 
the cost to service the warranty is estimated on the date of sale based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within a warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims that is higher than our past experience  or an increase in actual costs to service the claims is experienced  gross margin could be adversely affected 
our provision for warranty costs has decreased in fiscal and fiscal as a result of improved claims experience 
the following table provides a continuity of the warranty provision over the past two years 
fiscal year ended april  in millions balance  beginning of year warranty costs incurred warranties issued change in estimated warranty costs balance  end of year long lived assets we have recorded property  plant and equipment and intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization 
the determination of useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring or disposing of our existing businesses  which could result in an impairment charge 
we have not recorded any impairment charges in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant  as required by the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
we have four geographic units that have assigned goodwill of million in total as of april  april  million the us  canada and cala  emea and asia pacific 
quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units 
accordingly  consistent with this topic  our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers estimated future revenues and cash flows for those reporting units along with many other assumptions 
our us geographic unit represented of our total goodwill value and of our total revenue in fiscal our valuation approach therefore recognizes the significant concentration of goodwill in the us reporting unit 
our valuation approach includes a detailed valuation analysis of both the company as a whole and the us reporting unit 
in performing the annual goodwill impairment test we considered three generally accepted approaches for valuing a business the income  market and cost approaches 
based on the nature of our business and the us reporting unit s current and expected financial performance  we determined that the income and market approaches were the most appropriate methods for estimating the fair value of the us reporting unit under the first step of the analysis 
for the income approach we used the discounted cash flow method  and considered such factors as revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flow adjustments  terminal value  discount rate  tax rate  and tax amortization benefit 
for the market approach  we analyzed the valuation indicators that our market capitalization implies  including enterprise value to ebitda 
consideration of these factors inherently involves a significant amount of judgment  and significant movements in revenues or changes in the underlying assumptions used may result in fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
the result of the most recent annual impairment test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in no impairment charge 
the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the fiscal annual impairment test also resulted in no impairment charge 
in fiscal  due to the economic downturn  we lowered our expected cash flow forecasts and this  combined with significantly lower market multiples as a result of the general decline in global capital markets  resulted in a decline in the fair value of our us reporting unit in fiscal accordingly  the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and an impairment charge of million was recorded on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended april  
table of contents erosion in capital markets  material reductions in our expected cash flow forecasts  significant reductions in our market capitalization or a significant decline in economic conditions  in addition to changes to the underlying assumptions used in our valuation approach described above  could all lead to future impairment in goodwill 
special charges we record restructuring  exit and other loss accruals when the liability has been incurred 
we reassess the accruals on a regular basis to reflect changes in the timing or amount of estimated restructuring and termination costs on which the original estimates were based 
new restructuring accruals or reversals of previous accruals are recorded in the period of change 
additional accruals for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal resulted from new restructuring activities and primarily relate to lease terminations and severance costs 
no significant additions or reversals were made in fiscal  or as a result of changes in estimates 
estimates used to establish reserves related to real estate lease obligations have been reduced for sublease income that we believe is probable 
certain assumptions have been made as to the timing  availability and amount of sublease income that we expect to receive 
because we are required to project sublease income for many years into the future  estimates and assumptions regarding the commercial real estate market that were used to calculate future sublease income may be different from actual sublease income 
as of april   the liability relating to lease termination obligations was million  with million recorded as current april  total of million  with million recorded as current 
this estimate will change as a result of actual results  the passage of time and changes in assumptions regarding vacancy  market rate  and operating costs 
deferred taxes we have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is recorded 
future changes in estimates of taxable income could result in a significant change to the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
based on a number of factors  including completion of a reorganization of certain subsidiaries  cumulative income for the previous months and forecasted income excluding non recurring items  we determined that the weight of the evidence indicated that it was now more likely than not that we would realize a benefit from a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in canada 
as a result  we relieved a valuation allowance of approximately million  primarily relating to the deferred tax assets in canada 
at april   as a result of uncertainty regarding the future utilization of certain deferred tax assets  there continues to be a valuation allowance of million  against deferred tax assets primarily in canada and the united kingdom 
at april   based on our circumstances and uncertainty regarding the future utilization of net deferred tax assets on certain jurisdictions relating to most areas of the business  we recorded a million valuation allowance 
numerous taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax positions taken by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these jurisdictions 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
pension costs we currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan was closed to new employees in june our defined benefit pension costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by us to the actuaries  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
in estimating the rates and returns  we consider current market conditions and anticipate how these will affect discount rates  expected returns and rates of compensation increases 
material changes in our pension benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes to these assumptions or from fluctuations in our related headcount or market conditions 
in fiscal  our pension liability decreased by million to million from million at april  this decrease was the result our funding contributions and actual return on plan assets being higher than the expected return  partially offset by a strengthening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar 
we did not make any significant changes in our actuarial assumptions in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  our pension liability recorded on our balance sheet increased from million to million due to an increase in projected benefit obligation 
this increase in the projected benefit obligation is largely attributable to changes in valuation assumptions in fiscal  in particular a decrease in the discount rate used to present value the future obligation  which produced an unfavorable impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation 
during fiscal the pension liability recorded on our balance sheet decreased from million to million due to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation 
this decrease in the projected benefit obligation is largely attributable to changes in valuation assumptions in fiscal  in particular an increase in the discount rate used to present value the future obligation  which produced a favorable impact on the plan s projected benefit obligations 
actuarial gains or losses arise from assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected and actual return on assets 
the following assumptions were used in valuing the liabilities and benefits under the pension plan fiscal year ended april  discount rate compensation increase rate inflation rate average remaining service life of employees years years stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the stock compensation topic of the fasb asc 
the fair value of the stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model for each award  net of estimated forfeitures  and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we have estimated the volatility of our common shares using historical volatility of comparable public companies 
we expect to continue to use the historical volatility of comparable companies until our historical volatility as a publicly traded company is sufficiently established to measure expected volatility for option grants 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are summarized as follows april  april  april  risk free interest rate dividends expected volatility annual forfeiture rate expected life of the options years years years fair value per option as of each stock option grant date  we considered the fair value of the underlying common shares in order to establish a minimum option exercise price 
as of each stock option grant date  we reviewed an average of the disclosed year end volatility of a group of companies that we considered peers based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  similarity to us with respect to industry  business model  stage of growth and financial risk  along with considering the future plans of our company to determine the appropriate volatility 
the expected life was based on our historical stock option activity 
the risk free interest rate was determined by reference to the united states treasury rates with the remaining term approximating the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
for stock option modifications  such as the fiscal repricing and the fiscal and extension of option terms  we calculate the fair value of the options before the modification and the fair value of the options immediately after the modification  using the same principles as described above 
we recognize immediately as compensation expense the incremental fair value for vested options 
for unvested options we recognize as compensation expense the incremental fair value over the remaining vesting period 
based on these assumptions  stock based compensation expense reduced our results of operations by million for the year ended april  year ended april  million  million 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can  however  materially affect the fair value estimate 

table of contents as of april   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock option awards april  million 
we expect these to be recognized over a weighted average period of years april  years 
derivative instruments in fiscal  our change in fair value of derivative instruments was million due the change in fair value of certain warrants that are required to be recorded as a liability 
these warrants expired in fiscal in connection with the inter tel acquisition an embedded derivative was identified on the class preferred shares  since holders had the ability to receive cash equal to the value of shares into which the instrument converted after seven years 
accordingly  the embedded derivative was recorded at fair value  and marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in conjunction with the ipo  the class preferred shares were converted into common shares 
as a result  in fiscal  we recorded an million gain due to the change in fair value 
this was partially offset by a million expense due to the change in value of certain warrants that are required to be recorded as a liability 
in fiscal  a fair value gain of million was recorded as a result of re measuring the derivative instrument 
the gain in fiscal was primarily driven by the reduction in the fair value of our shares 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  to address concerns raised by constituents relating to the accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
the amendments in this asu change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality will no longer be within the scope of guidance in the software revenue recognition subtopic of the fasb asc 
the amendments in this asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are required to adopt this asu in fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu   to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria in the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements subtopic of the fasb asc 
as a result of those amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing gaap 
the amendments in this asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are required to adopt this asu in fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu to enhance disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
we adopted this asu in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of this asu  we provided additional disclosures surrounding our sales type lease receivables and the related allowances within note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
we are required to adopt this asu in the fourth quarter of fiscal we do not expect to the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in our future earnings due to adverse changes in financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in our common share price  foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
equity price risk under our deferred share unit plan  adopted december   when a participant ceases to be an executive of ours  the deferred share unit plan participant will receive a cash amount equal to the number of deferred share units in his or her account multiplied by the price of a common share as of the date the deferred share unit plan participant ceases to be an executive of ours  or on a later date selected by the deferred share unit plan participant  which shall in any event be a date prior to the end of the following calendar year 
the obligation to pay the cash amount is recorded as a liability in our financial statements and is marked to market in each reporting 
table of contents period  with changes in the obligation recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
a increase in our common share price would have decreased our net incomes for fiscal and fiscal by less than million 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency rate fluctuations related primarily to our future net cash flows from operations in canadian dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
when possible  we use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables  payables and intercompany balances 
these contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes  and are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes 
foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair market value 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contract is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of april   a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized loss of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
as at april   a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized loss of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rate risk in accordance with our corporate policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade commercial paper and money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than three months 
due to the short term maturity of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our million revolving credit facility  which currently bears interest at a rate of libor plus 
if the entire revolving credit facility were utilized  each adverse change in the libor rate of would currently result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
at april   no amount was outstanding under the revolving facility 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on million outstanding on april  under our first lien term loan which matures on august  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus and million outstanding on april  under our second lien term loan which matures on august  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus 
the impact of each adverse change in the libor rate of on the first lien term loan and the second lien term loan  in aggregate  would result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
the interest rates on our obligations under capital leases are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
credit risk our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and other receivables 
cash equivalents are invested in government and commercial paper with investment grade credit rating 
we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers 
however  we have a large number of diverse customers to minimize concentrations of credit risk 
as part of the totalsolution program  we offer sales type leases to our customers to fund their purchases 
as of april   we had million april  million of sales type lease receivables  net of reserves for uncollectible lease repayments  on our balance sheet 
we regularly sell the net rental streams from sales type leases to financial institutions 
recourse on the sold rental payments is contractually limited to the lesser of i the net credit losses in a given period and ii a percentage of the sum of the portfolio balance for a specific portfolio of sold leases at the beginning of the period plus the purchase price paid for leases acquired during the given period 
as of april  and  we were subject to limited recourse on rental streams sold to financial institutions with such recourse in any year varying from to of the net book value of sold rental streams 
we maintain reserves against our estimate of potential recourse for the balance of sales type leases and for the balance of sold rental payments remaining unbilled 
reserve levels are established based on portfolio size  loss experience  levels of past due accounts and periodic detailed reviews of the portfolio 
the aggregate reserve for uncollectible lease payments and recourse liability represents the reserve for the entire lease portfolio 
we believe our current reserve levels are sufficient given our historic loss rates 
the following table provides detail on the total net balances in sales type leases 
table of contents april  april  april  millions lease balances included in consolidated accounts receivable  net of allocated allowances of april  april net investment in sales type leases current portion  net of allowances of april  april long term portion  includes residual amounts of april  april  net of allowances of april  april total investment in sales type leases  net of allowances of april  april sold rental payments remaining unbilled subject to limited recourse provisions  net of lease recourse liability reserves of april  april total balance of sales type leases and sold rental payments remaining unbilled  net of allowances and reserves total allowances and reserves for entire lease portfolio including lease recourse liabilities
