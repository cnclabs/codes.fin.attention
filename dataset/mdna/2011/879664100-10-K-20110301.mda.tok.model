quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments in marketable securities during the normal course of business  we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities 
for a discussion of our investments in marketable securities for the fiscal years ended december   and january   see the notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report  included herein as exhibit  and incorporated herein by reference 
financial contracts and market risk we conduct business on a global basis in us and foreign currencies subjecting us to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional exposures that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
the derivative foreign exchange contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
derivative financial contracts involve elements of market and credit risk 
the market risk that results from these contracts relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which generally are offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities 
we monitor the counterparties credit ratings and other market data to minimize credit risk 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate contract amount entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk 
cash flow hedges we use foreign currency forward and option contracts  designated as cash flow hedges  to mitigate currency risk related to an imbalance of nonfunctional currency denominated costs and related revenue 
we conduct monthly effectiveness tests of these hedging relationships on a spot to spot basis  excluding forward points 
effective gains and losses from derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions occur  at which time they are reclassified to total cost of revenue 
ineffectiveness is recorded to other income expense  net 
if it becomes probable that an anticipated transaction that is hedged will not occur  we immediately reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to 
table of contents other income expense  net 
at december   we did not have any cash flow hedges outstanding 
we continue to monitor the company s overall currency exposure and may elect to add additional cash flow hedges in the future if deemed necessary 
balance sheet hedges non designated hedges short term monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the tellabs entity entering into the transaction are remeasured through income as foreign currency rates fluctuate 
changes in the value of derivative contracts intended to offset these fluctuations are also recorded in income 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are generally offset by gains or losses of the underlying transactions being hedged 
these derivative contracts are not designated as hedges 
at december   we held non designated foreign currency forward contracts in eleven currencies  with a gross notional equivalent of million 
the maturities of the foreign currency forward contracts held at year end range from one to nine months 
our net foreign currency exposure is diversified among a broad number of currencies 
the notional amounts reflected in the following table represent the us dollar values of the agreed upon amounts that will be delivered to a third party on the agreed upon date december  in millions notional amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold total net investment hedges we entered into three month foreign currency forward contracts  designated as net investment hedges  to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our foreign subsidiaries to preserve the us dollar value of our euro cash 
effective changes in the fair value of these contracts due to exchange rate fluctuations are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
those amounts will be reflected in income only when we dispose of the investment in the foreign subsidiary 
we conduct monthly effectiveness tests of net investment hedges on a spot to spot basis  excluding forward points  and any measurement of ineffectiveness is recorded in income 
as of december   we had a net unrealized gain of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes a net gain of million related to settled contracts and a net loss of million related to unsettled contracts 
we held net investment hedges with a notional value of million euros at the end of all net investment hedges were contracted with three month maturities 
the notional amounts reflected in the following table represent the us dollar values of the agreed upon amounts that will be delivered to a third party on the agreed upon date december  in millions notional amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold total
