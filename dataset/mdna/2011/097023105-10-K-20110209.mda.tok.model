commercial airplanes revenues increased by  million  primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in deliveries in were lower as a result of a 
table of contents labor strike in increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues 
bds revenues increased by  million  primarily due to higher revenues in global services support gs s and boeing military aircraft bma  partially offset by lower revenues in n ss 
bcc revenues decreased by million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio 
other segment revenues decreased by million partly due to higher revenues in from the sale of four c aircraft held under operating lease 
lower unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by million primarily due to lower p a poseidon intercompany revenues recognized by commercial airplanes in compared with earnings from operations the following table summarizes our earnings loss from operations dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing capital corporation other segment unallocated items and eliminations total operating earnings in increased by  million compared with commercial airplanes earnings increased by  million  primarily due to  million of costs related to the first three flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in and the reach forward losses on the program of  million 
bds earnings decreased by million compared with due to lower revenues and margins in the bma segment and lower revenues in the n ss segment 
other segment earnings decreased by million primarily due to million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values 
operating earnings in decreased by  million compared with commercial airplanes earnings decreased by  million primarily due to  million of costs related to the first three flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in august that these aircraft could not be sold 
the earnings decrease is also attributable to  million in reach forward losses on the program in  compared with million in lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower earnings 
these decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in compared with bds earnings increased by million compared with primarily due to higher earnings in the bma segment partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment 
other segment losses decreased by million primarily due to recognition of pre tax expense of million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year 
unallocated items and eliminations in reduced earnings by million compared with  which is further explained in the table below 

table of contents the most significant items included in unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  share based plans deferred compensation pension postretirement other unallocated items and eliminations total share based plans expense decreased in by million primarily due to the expiration of the sharevalue trust at june  deferred compensation expense decreased by million in and increased by million in the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions 
other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by million in primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items as well as a million charitable contribution 
the increase of million was primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations  elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment 
unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and other unallocated items and eliminations 
dollars in millions pension other postretirement benefits years ended december  allocated to business segments other unallocated items and eliminations total 
table of contents other earnings items dollars in millions years ended december  earnings from operations other income expense  net interest and debt expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations other income increased by million in primarily due to investment income on higher cash and investment balances throughout the decrease in of million was driven by lower investment income due to both lower interest rates and investment balances 
interest and debt expense increased by million and million in and due to debt issued in our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was higher in  compared with  primarily because pre tax book income in was higher than in and because of an income tax charge of million recorded during the first quarter of as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of this was partially offset by a tax benefit of million recorded during the fourth quarter of as a result of settling the federal audit 
our effective tax rate was lower in  compared with  primarily because tax credits  such as research and development credits  represented a higher proportion of earnings before taxes due to the year over year reduction in earnings 
for additional discussion related to income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
backlog our backlog at december was as follows dollars in millions contractual backlog commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing military aircraft network space systems global services support total boeing defense  space security total contractual backlog unobligated backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and us government contract funding 
the increase in contractual backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation  partially reduced by cancellations of orders 
the decrease in backlog during was due to deliveries in excess of orders  changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders 

table of contents unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is due to decreases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts including the v  brigade combat team modernization bctm and chinook programs  partially offset by multi year procurement contract awards on the f a and international space station programs 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is primarily due to decreases at bds of  million compared with partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the us army of the bctm system development and demonstration contract relating to manned ground vehicles and associated systems and equipment 
approved funding of existing multi year contracts including the bctm  v  chinook  proprietary and gmd programs also reduced unobligated backlog 
segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment global passenger traffic exceeded initial expectations in growing an estimated for the year and showing growth over prior peak levels 
significant variation existed between regions and airline business models with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading recovery and growth into air cargo traffic also rebounded in after two years of contraction 
led by strong growth in asian exports  air cargo traffic recovered to peak levels and is poised to resume growth in airlines cut capacity in to match the demand environment which allowed them to boost yields as demand recovered in airlines have also pursued new revenue sources by expanding alliances and building ancillary revenue streams 
in addition  airlines continued to focus on cutting costs and pursued consolidation opportunities  particularly in mature markets  to improve market positioning 
these airline tactics  combined with improving demand and relatively stable fuel prices  have driven a strong turnaround in airline industry profitability 
airlines are forecast to earn billion in following a billion net loss in the outlook is for continued profitability which should allow airlines to rebuild balance sheets that suffered from fuel price spikes and recession in the long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes  disease outbreaks such as avian or hn flu  terrorism  conflicts and increased global environmental regulations 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in europe and asia has enabled low cost airlines to continue gaining market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 

table of contents continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately of commercial airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with us airlines 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china and japan are likely to enter the to seat aircraft market over the next few years 
many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government provided support  including launch aid  which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables planes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
changes in value of the us dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in impacted competitors revenues and profits 
competitors routinely respond to relatively weaker dollars by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings  a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through if the us dollar strengthens again  airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development  gain market share through pricing and or improve earnings 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings loss from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog 
table of contents revenues year over year changes in revenue are shown in the following table dollars in millions vs 
vs 
new airplane sales commercial aviation services business other total revenues for decreased by  million or compared with the decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower deliveries resulting from a production rate change from to per month beginning in june and no deliveries on the program due to the transition from the to the derivative 
the increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares 
the increase in revenue of  million in from was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues 
revenues were negatively impacted by a iam strike 
the decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions 
commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december were as follows total cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries includes intercompany deliveries of aircraft in  aircraft in and aircraft and aircraft in earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased by  million compared with the increase was primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three flight test aircraft  and the reach forward losses on the program 
costs of  million included in research and development expense in for the first three flight test airplanes were a result of our determination that these aircraft could not be sold 
the reach forward loss on the program of  million during was primarily due to increased production costs  reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the the remaining net decrease in earnings for was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of million and lower new airplane deliveries 

table of contents earnings from operations for decreased by  million compared with  primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of the three flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory  partially offset by a million decrease in other research and development expense 
the decrease in earnings is also attributable to  million in reach forward losses on the program in  compared with million in lower commercial aviation services revenues and margins reduced earnings by million 
higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the and schedule delays announced in and and infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike reduced earnings by million 
increased period and other costs reduced earnings by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of  million related to new airplane deliveries 
backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before boeing and the customer are required to perform 
backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain  such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors  shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements 
all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain 
firm orders exclude options 
a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
however  once orders are included in firm backlog  orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled  although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers 
the increase in contractual backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation  partially reduced by cancellations of orders 
the decrease in backlog during was due to deliveries in excess of orders  changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders 
accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which does not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates 
this has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 
the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates  all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 

table of contents the table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
program program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders a final determination of the initial accounting quantity for the program will be made in the quarter of first airplane delivery  targeted for the third quarter of program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during during  we announced plans to increase monthly production of the from to airplanes per month beginning in the first quarter of and a further increase to airplanes per month beginning in the second quarter of program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during during and  we recorded charges of  million and million to recognize reach forward losses on the program reflecting higher than anticipated costs  a reduction in delivery price increases associated with escalation and difficult cargo market conditions which caused us to defer a planned production rate increase for first flight of the freighter occurred on february  a fourth aircraft was added to the flight test program in july to improve flight test efficiency 
on september   we announced that the expected first delivery of the freighter would move to the middle of from the fourth quarter of and a fifth airplane would be added to the flight test fleet to support the new schedule 
the new delivery schedule followed an assessment of the expected cumulative impact of flight test discoveries  which include a low frequency vibration in certain flight conditions and an underperforming aileron actuator 
while neither issue required structural changes to the airplane  they led to disruptions to certification testing  which the program was unable to offset within the prior schedule 
we are currently producing airplanes and until completion of our flight test program  there is risk that additional items may be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced 
on march   we announced that we will accelerate  from mid to mid  a planned production rate increase from to airplanes per month 
certification and first delivery of the intercontinental passenger derivative is expected in the fourth quarter of schedule and other risks inherent in the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development remain 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during in april  we announced that monthly production of the will decline from to airplanes per month 
table of contents beginning in june in march  we announced that we will accelerate by approximately six months  from early to mid  a planned production rate increase to airplanes per month 
in december  we announced that monthly production of the will increase from to airplanes per month in the first quarter program first flight of the occurred on december  and flight testing for certification continued during flight testing involves six flight test aircraft and a limited amount of testing on two production configured airplanes prior to first delivery 
on august   we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the had been moved to mid first quarter from the fourth quarter of this schedule revision followed an assessment of the cumulative impact of a number of issues  including supplier workmanship issues related to the horizontal stabilizer  instrumentation delays and the expected availability date of an engine needed to support the final phases of flight test 
on november   a flight test aircraft lost primary electrical power as a result of an onboard fire 
back up systems functioned as expected allowing the crew to complete a safe landing 
flight testing was suspended pending investigation 
on november   we announced minor design changes to power distribution panels and updates to systems software resulting from the investigation 
on december   we resumed boeing flight test activities and on january  resumed certification testing 
on january   we announced that the expected date of first delivery had been moved to the third quarter of due to the flight testing and certification delays 
a number of engineering and other design changes have been identified in conjunction with the flight test program that are being incorporated into our production system and on aircraft already completed 
during  we continued to produce airplanes and until completion of our flight test program  there is risk that additional items will be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced 
we continue to monitor and address challenges associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain  incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly  completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration 
for example  during the second quarter of we delayed some component deliveries to reduce out of sequence work moving into final assembly at our everett factory and improve supply chain efficiency 
we continue to work toward planned increases in production rates as well as the timely introduction of the derivative 
such efforts include the construction of a second assembly line in north charleston  south carolina and establishing transitional surge capacity at our everett  washington location 
on july   we completed firm configuration of the airplane with first delivery scheduled for late we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes  including delivery delays and supplier assertions 
efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft 
a number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and or performance 
we continue to address customer and supplier claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth 
during  we concluded that the first three flight test aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft 
as a result  costs associated with these aircraft were included in research and development expense 
we believe that the other three flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at december  if we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold  we may incur additional charges 

table of contents our current assessment is that the program is not in a reach forward loss position  however the cumulative impacts of the production challenges  schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability and we expect to record zero margin on our initial deliveries 
we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to address this pressure 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
these costs are expected to increase with and entry into service 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and planned certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
logo our research and development expense decreased by  million in this was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of  million of production costs related to the three flight test aircraft in  partially offset by a million increase of other research and development expense 
our research and development expense increased by  million in this was due to the reclassification of production costs related to the three flight test aircraft and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments  partially offset by a million decrease of other research and development expense 
additional considerations the and programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes  particularly as both the freighter and the continue the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development 
development also continues on the and intercontinental 
costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred 
costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting 
airplane programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity 
generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery 
each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery 
a price escalation formula based on pre defined factors is used to determine the final price of 
table of contents the airplane at the time of customer delivery 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs  utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners 
as technical or quality issues arise  such as issues experienced on the and programs  we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft 
additionally  price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future 
there are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach forward losses 
these include changes to the program accounting quantity  customer and model mix  production costs and rates  capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity  learning curve  anticipated cost reductions  flight test and certification schedules  costs  schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims  supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations 
while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  order cancellations or other financially significant exposure 
boeing defense  space security business environment and trends us defense environment overview the us continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense  natural disasters  stabilization efforts  counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations  or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means 
the us department of defense us dod faces the simultaneous requirements to execute the national security policy  recapitalize important capabilities  and transform the force to meet the changing national security threat environment as articulated in the national security strategy and quadrennial defense review 
these actions must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis  the national debt and healthcare reform 
as a result  the traditional roles of defense and security are converging into a single set of customer needs 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment 
us government policies impacting the defense environment include efficiency initiatives to save at least billion through  defense acquisition reform  increased insourcing  concerns over the decline of the us industrial base  a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions  and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances 
in january  the us dod announced its intention to further reduce its top line base budget by billion over the next five years 
although the us dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  we expect the total budget growth rate to level off or even decline slightly over the next several years due to these shifting priorities and budget pressures 
the fiscal year discretionary budget of billion includes an overseas contingency operations oco budget of billion 
procurement is expected to increase  while research and development accounts are expected to decrease due to growing requirements from operations and maintenance o m and personnel costs tied to us commitments overseas 
however  this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development 
the near term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the to period for investment efforts 
although opportunities may exist following complete us troop draw downs in iraq in late  they may be offset by sustained o m requirements in afghanistan 
early indications suggest that coalition forces will sustain operations in the afghanistan theater longer than initially anticipated 
we continue to see pressure to reduce oco requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars 

table of contents it is unlikely that the us dod will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives 
this imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the us dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs 
we expect the us dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition efficiencies and reforms and emphasizing utilization of commercial off the shelf solutions and network enabled operations 
these strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  cybersecurity  precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons  electronic warfare  as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
international environment overview the international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and countries need to modernize aging inventories 
western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets 
in europe  global economic conditions are creating downward pressure on budget resources and austerity measures have been put in place to reduce defense spending in the near term 
the strongest opportunities for growth of the bds portfolio will be in the middle east and asia pacific regions where modernization budgets remain relatively stable 
with increasing needs and aging equipment  these regions have the financial strength necessary to make future defense purchases 
boeing portfolio of defense  space and security solutions offers proven capability  predictable price  and near term availability that are well matched to this challenging international environment 
adjacent market environment overview we are repositioning our business to expand our capabilities and accelerate growth in the following targeted adjacencies unmanned systems  cyber and information services  security  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr  and logistics command and control logc and energy services 
we anticipate continued growth in unmanned systems as these products provide critical mission functions to the warfighter with a focus on affordability  persistence  and accuracy 
the demand for defensive  offensive  and exploit operations in the emerging cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers 
key growth areas in security include aviation security  border security  maritime security and cybersecurity as the us government looks to work more closely with state and local institutions 
the dependence on time critical information for intelligence based operations has fueled the need for cisr technologies that locate  identify  and track elusive and ephemeral targets 
we continue to find opportunity in the logc market in areas including logistics operations  supply chain management  and logistics training and simulations 
lastly  as energy volatility increases and pressure is placed on the national grid infrastructure  we expect that the need for energy services such as energy management  infrastructure security  and scenario modeling will increase accordingly 
bds realignment effective january   and  certain programs were realigned among bds segments 
business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment 

table of contents operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues bds revenues decreased by  million in compared with  due to lower revenues in all three segments  with the largest decrease in the n ss segment 
bds revenues increased by  million in compared with  due to higher revenues in gs s and bma  partially offset by decreases in n ss 
operating earnings bds operating earnings in decreased by million compared with primarily due to lower margins in the bma segment and lower revenues in the n ss segment 
bds operating earnings in increased by million compared with primarily due to higher earnings in the bma segment  partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment 
backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
bds total backlog increased by less than in  from  million to  million  primarily due to multi year procurement contract awards on the f a and international space station programs  two commercial satellite contract awards  and the uk future logistics information services flis contract award  offset by current year deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include family of beyond line of sight terminals  bctm  gmd  joint tactical radio system  p a poseidon and proprietary programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays 
table of contents and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of our fixed price development programs include airborne early warning and control aew c  p i  kc international tanker  and commercial and military satellites

research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers needs in us and international growth areas such as military commercial derivatives  rotorcraft  global strike  missiles and unmanned airborne systems  and surveillance and engagement systems 
the products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products 
investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems  advanced sensors and electronic warfare 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness  interoperability  reliability and reducing the cost of ownership 
backlog bma total backlog in decreased from  primarily due to deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by a multi year contract award on the f a program 
total backlog in was virtually unchanged from backlog increases due to orders for c  p i and chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the f a program 
additional considerations aew c the aew c development program  also known as wedgetail in australia  peace eagle in turkey and peace eye in the republic of korea  consists of aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which have never been installed on an airplane before 
wedgetail includes six aircraft and peace eagle and peace eye include four aircraft each 
during  and  we recorded charges increasing the reach forward losses on the aew c programs in australia and turkey by million  million and million  respectively 
these charges reflect technical performance issues associated with the test program  delivery schedule delays  subsystem development issues  and additional time for integration testing 
during  four wedgetail aircraft were delivered to australia with initial customer acceptance 
final customer acceptance for all six wedgetail aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of in january  the peace eagle program began the formal test phase 
these are advanced and complex fixed price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
we believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed 
kc international tanker the kc international tanker program includes four aircraft for the italian air force and four aircraft for the japanese air self defense force 
during  and  we recorded charges increasing the reach forward losses in the kc international tanker program by million  million and million  respectively 
the final delivery to japan was made in december and first delivery to italy was made in december the italian kc tanker program is ongoing  and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed

this difference is expensed ratably in future years 
based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ula  this amortization is expected to be approximately million annually for the next years 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and lockheed each committed to provide up to million to support ula s working capital requirements through december  we and lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain us government contracts to ula as of the closing date 
we and lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the us government

estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the

approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
income tax obligations as of december   our total liability for income taxes payable  including uncertain tax positions  was million  of which million we expect to pay in the next twelve months

critical accounting policies contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 

table of contents due to the size  duration and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
a number of our contracts are in a reach forward loss position 
changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured part costs  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 

table of contents to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs  excluding the and programs  for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
the program is in a reach forward loss position having recorded a total of  million of reach forward losses in and absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs  subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin 
reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity  whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately 
our current assessment is that the program does not have a reach forward loss 
the cumulative impacts of the production challenges  schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on revenue and cost estimates such that we expect to record zero margin on the initial deliveries 
the scale and duration of the program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach forward loss 
aircraft valuation allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings  collateral values and default rates 
if each customer s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were higher or lower at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease  the allowance would have increased or decreased by million 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for re lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  residual values equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december   and a future cumulative pre tax earnings reduction of approximately million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which approximately million would be recognized in our investment in sales type finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income 
declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have reduced pre tax income by million for the year ended december  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
april is our annual testing date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future 
table of contents periods 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
as of december  and  we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible assets by less than million 
postretirement plans almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after december  we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements are based upon several assumptions  including the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense  projected benefit obligations and shareholders equity 
the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate as of december  dollars in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans projected benefit obligation net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
a decrease or increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million 
differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year s pension cost 
the asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period 
despite investment gains during and  the significant losses incurred during will cause net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately billion and the portion recognized in earnings for to increase by approximately million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses 
absent increases in interest rates  higher asset values and or higher contributions  net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with that of bcc s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates 
as of december   the impact over the next months of a basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be a million increase to bcc s pre tax earnings 
for purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis  we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt including the impact of derivatives remain unchanged from year end and that they are all subject to immediate re pricing 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes 
based on the portfolio of other boeing fixed rate debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by million 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
