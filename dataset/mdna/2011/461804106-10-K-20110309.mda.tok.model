item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional information related to the revenues  income and assets attributable to the company primary operating segment 
title insurance through its two wholly owned title underwriting subsidiaries  itic and nitic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
itic and nitic offer primary title insurance coverage to both owners and mortgagees of real estate  as well as the reinsurance of title insurance risks to other title insurance companies 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects affecting real property 
the commitments and policies are predominantly issued using standard forms approved by the american land title association alta 
upon a real estate closing  the seller executes a deed to the new owner 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake or omission in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against the title to real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
numerous types of defects could jeopardize the property owner or mortgagee s interest in the property  as defined in the title policy 
such risks include title being vested in an individual or entity other than the insured  unmarketable title  lack of a right of access to the property  invalidity or unenforceability of the insured mortgage  or other defects  liens  or encumbrances against the property 
examples of common types of covered risks include defects arising from prior unsatisfied mortgages  tax liens or confirmed assessments  judgments against the property or encumbrances against the property arising through easements  restrictions or other existing covenants 
title insurance also generally protects against deeds or mortgages with inaccurate legal descriptions  that were forged or improperly acknowledged or delivered  that were executed by spouses without the other spouse s signature or release of marital interest or that were conveyed by minors or incompetents 
title insurance policies 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real property owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner has to purchase a separate owner title insurance policy to protect his investment 
the company issues title insurance policies on the basis of a title report 
the title report documents the current status of title to the property 
insured risk on policies in force 
generally  the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance under a title insurance policy is equal to the lesser of the purchase price or the fair market value of the insured property 
if a claim is made against an insured property s title  the insurer is responsible for paying the legal costs of eliminating covered title defects and defending the insured party against covered title defects affecting the property 
the insurer may choose to pay the policy limits to the insured or  if the loss is less than policy limits  the amount of the insured s actual loss due to the title defect  at which time the insurer duty to defend the claim and all other obligations of the insurer with respect to the claim are satisfied 
at any given time  the insurer actual risk of monetary loss under outstanding policies is only a portion of the aggregate insured risk  or total face amount  of all policies in force 
the lower risk results primarily from the reissuance of title insurance policies by other underwriters over time when the property is subsequently conveyed or refinanced 
the coverage on a lender title insurance policy is reduced and eventually terminated as the mortgage loan it secures is paid 
an owner policy is effective as long as the insured has an ownership interest in the property or has liability under warranties of title 
due to the variability of these factors  the aggregate contingent liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined with any precision 
losses and reserves 
while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising from unforeseen events  title insurance is based upon a process of loss avoidance 
title insurance generally serves to protect the policyholder from the risk of loss from events that predate the issuance of the policy 
losses on policies typically occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process or upon the occurrence of certain hidden risks which cannot be determined from an accurate search of public land records 
the maximum amount of liability under a title insurance policy is generally the face amount of the policy plus the cost of defending the insured s title against an adverse claim and any inflation protection clause associated with the policy 
reserves for claim losses are established based upon known claims  as well as estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to the company based upon historical experience and other factors 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts  are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure 
therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
for a more complete description of the company s reserves for claims  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
title insurance underwriting operations 
itic and nitic issue title insurance through branch operations or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries determine the terms and conditions upon which they will insure title to the real property according to their underwriting standards  policies and procedures 
title insurance premiums written reflect a one time premium payment  with no recurring premiums 
generally  premiums for title insurance are recorded and recognized as revenue at the closing of the related transaction  when the earnings process is considered complete 
when the policy is issued directly through a branch office  the premiums collected are retained by the company 
when the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  the agent retains a majority of the premium as a commission 
title insurance commissions earned by the company agents are recognized as expense concurrently with premium recognition 
the percentage of the premium retained by agents varies from region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written by direct and agency operations  refer to item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
geographic operations 
itic was incorporated in north carolina in  and is licensed to write title insurance in states and the district of columbia 
it currently writes title insurance in states and the district of columbia  primarily in the eastern half of the united states 
nitic was incorporated in south carolina in  and is licensed to write title insurance in states and the district of columbia 
it currently writes title insurance as a primary insurer and as a reinsurer in the states of new york and texas  and as a reinsurer for itic 
premiums from title insurance written on properties located in the state of north carolina represent the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment 
in north carolina  itic primarily issues title insurance commitments and policies through branch offices 
in other states  title policies are primarily issued through issuing agents 
for a description of the level of net premiums written geographically for significant states  refer to item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
each state license authorizing itic or nitic to write title insurance must be renewed annually 
these licenses are necessary for the companies to operate as a title insurer in each state in which they write premiums 
ratings 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies designed to indicate their financial condition and or their claims paying ability 
the rating agencies determine ratings primarily by analyzing financial data 
reinsurance 
the company assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance companies in the normal course of business 
reinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer 
ceded reinsurance is comprised of excess of loss treaties  which protects against losses over certain amounts 
in the ordinary course of business  itic and nitic reinsure certain risks with other title insurers to limit their risk exposure and to comply with state insurance regulations 
they also assume reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers for which they receive additional income 
for the last two years  revenues from reinsurance activities accounted for less than of total premium volume 
exchange services  investment management and trust services  and management services the company s other lines of business include services offered by wholly owned subsidiaries itec  itac  investors trust  icmc  and itms 
in  the company established itec to provide services in connection with tax deferred exchanges of like kind property pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
itec acts as an intermediary in tax deferred exchanges of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investments  and its income is derived from fees for handling exchange transactions and interest earned on client deposits held by the company 
itac provides services for accomplishing reverse exchanges when taxpayers decide to acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
the services provided by the company s exchange division  itec and itac  are pursuant to provisions in the internal revenue code 
from time to time  these laws are subject to review and changes  which may negatively affect the demand for tax deferred exchanges in general  and consequently the revenues and profitability of the company s exchange division 
investors trust and icmc work together to provide investment management and trust services to individuals  companies  banks and trusts 
itms offers various consulting services to provide clients with the technical expertise to start and successfully operate a title insurance agency 
none of these subsidiaries is currently a reportable segment for which separate financial information is presented  instead  they are collectively included and reported in the category all other in the company s financial statements 
cyclicality and seasonality real estate activity  home sales and mortgage lending are cyclical in nature 
title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales 
the availability of funds to finance purchases directly affects real estate sales 
other factors include mortgage interest rates  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand and family income levels 
the company s premiums in future periods are likely to fluctuate due to these and other factors which are beyond management s control 
historically  the title insurance business tends to be seasonal as well as cyclical 
because home sales are typically strongest in periods of favorable weather  the first calendar quarter tends to have the lowest activity levels  while the remaining spring and summer quarters tend to be more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal  but it is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
fluctuations in mortgage interest rates  as well as other economic factors  can cause cyclical shifts in real estate activity outside of the normal pattern of seasonality 
the company anticipates that current market conditions  including the subprime lending crisis  rising foreclosures  weakening home sales  falling home prices and declining commercial real estate prices  will be the primary influences on the company s operations until further stabilization occurs 
marketing the company markets its title insurance services to a broad range of customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
itic and nitic strive to provide superior service to their customers and consider this an important factor in attracting and retaining customers 
branch and corporate personnel strive to develop new business and agency relationships to increase market share  and itic commercial services division provides services to commercial clients 
regulation title insurance the company is an insurance holding company and therefore it is subject to regulation in the states in which its insurance subsidiaries do business 
these regulations  among others  require insurance holding companies to register and file certain reports  and require prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany distributions or transfers 
title insurance companies are extensively regulated under applicable state laws 
all states have requirements for admission to do business as an insurance company  including minimum levels of capital and surplus and establishing reserves 
state regulatory authorities monitor the stability and service of insurance companies and possess broad powers with respect to the licensing of title insurers and agents  approving rate schedules and policy forms  financial reporting and accounting practices  reserve requirements  investments and dividend restrictions  as well as examinations and audits of title insurers 
at december   both itic and nitic met the statutory premium reserve requirements and the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the states in which they are licensed 
a substantial portion of the assets of the company s title insurance subsidiaries consists of their portfolios of investment securities 
both of these subsidiaries are required by various states laws to maintain assets of a defined minimum quality and amount 
the company insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination at any time by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed 
these and other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which the title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including but not limited to  the real estate settlement procedures act respa  the primary federal regulatory guidance covering the real estate settlement industry 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
this legislation overhauls the regulations governing the real estate finance industry  and creates the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb as an independent agency within the federal reserve bank 
the cfpb will have primary regulatory and enforcement authority over most consumer financial products and services  including the administration of respa 
within months of the passage of the act  the cfbp must propose rules to harmonize the current respa disclosures with the required disclosures under the truth in lending act 
the cfpb will also have authority to identify and address  through regulation  unfair  deceptive and abusive practices in the mortgage industry and certain other settlement service industries 
the cfpb has been given broad enforcement authority to impose civil penalties for violations of  per day for routine violations   per day for knowing violations and  per day for reckless violations 
once fully established  the cfpb may propose rules which will potentially impact the business of the company 
further proposals to change regulations governing insurance holding companies and the title insurance industry are often introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various insurance regulatory agencies 
the company regularly monitors such proposals  but their likelihood and timing  and the impact they may have on the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time 
any material change in the company s regulatory environment may have an adverse effect on its business 
exchange services  investment management and trust services  and management services exchange services are not federally regulated by any regulatory commission 
itec and itac provide services pursuant to internal revenue service regulations providing taxpayers a safe harbor by using a qualified intermediary to structure tax deferred exchanges of property and using an exchange accommodation titleholder to hold property in reverse exchange transactions 
investors trust is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
icmc and itms are not regulated by any federal regulatory commission 
competition the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
the four largest title insurance companies typically maintain greater than eighty percent of the market for title insurance in the united states  with smaller regional companies holding the balance of the market 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the respective geographic areas in which the company conducts business 
key competitive factors in the title insurance industry are the financial strength and size of the insurer  timeliness and quality of service  price and expertise in certain transactions 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents based upon service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and related information than the company 
in addition  there are numerous industry related regulations and statutes that set out conditions and requirements to conduct business 
changes to or the removal of such regulations and statutes could result in additional competition from alternative title insurance products or new entrants into the industry that could materially affect the company business operations and financial condition 
customers the company is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
investment policies the company and its subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their income from investments in federal and municipal government securities and investment grade corporate bonds and equity securities 
the company s investment policy is designed to maintain a high quality portfolio and maximize income 
some state laws impose restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that can be made by the company insurance subsidiaries 
the company manages its investment portfolio via an affiliated entity 
the securities in the company s portfolio are subject to economic conditions and normal market risks 
the company s equity securities at december  and consisted of investments in various industry groups 
there were no significant investments in banks  trust and insurance companies at december  short term investments  which consist primarily of money market instruments and certificates of deposit which have an original maturity of one year or less  are carried at cost  which approximates fair value due to the short duration to maturity 
in addition  at december  and  the company held investments that are accounted for using the equity method see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the major categories of investments  scheduled maturities  fair values of investment securities and earnings by category 
environmental matters the title insurance policies itic and nitic currently issue exclude any liability for environmental risks and contamination unless the company issues a specific policy endorsement providing coverage for environmental liens recorded prior to the date of policy 
the company has not experienced and does not anticipate that it or its subsidiaries will incur any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
in connection with tax deferred exchanges of like kind property  itec and itac may temporarily hold title to property pursuant to an accommodation titleholder agreement 
in such situations  the person or entity for which title is being held must execute an indemnification agreement under which it agrees to indemnify itec or itac for any environmental or other claims which may arise as a result of the arrangement 
employees the holding company has no paid employees 
officers of the holding company are full time paid employees of itic 
the company s subsidiaries had full time employees and part time employees as of december  none of the employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
management considers its relationship with its employees to be favorable

item a 
risk factors the risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements or could result in a significant or material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are subject to cyclical demand for title insurance  which depends upon the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions and mortgage refinancing transactions and economic factors 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services varies over time and from year to year and is dependent upon  among other factors  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions and mortgage financing and refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as the state of the overall economy  the average price of real estate sales  the availability of mortgage financing and mortgage interest rates 
during an economic downturn or recession  as currently exists in the united states  or when the availability of credit  including mortgage financing  is limited or mortgage interest rates are increasing  real estate activity typically declines 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused volatility in revenue and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
the real estate and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption for more than years and have created a difficult operating environment for the company and other companies in industries related to real estate 
the value of residential real estate property and the volume of new and existing home sales have significantly declined since the market peak in in addition  the company holds investments in entities which may be negatively impacted by these conditions 
the ultimate depth and duration of the current economic instability is unknown 
if the current levels of real estate and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience adverse effects  which may be material  to its results of operations and financial condition 
demand for title insurance also depends in part upon the requirement by mortgage lenders and other participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property 
the company may experience material losses resulting from fraud  defalcation or misconduct 
fraud  defalcation and other misconduct by the company s agents  approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the company s business 
agents and approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trust pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions and misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in large title claims 
during the recent economic downturn  the company has experienced an increase in losses from these factors as compared to historical experience 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  the company could continue to experience greater than normal losses from fraud  defalcation and misconduct 
unfavorable claims experience will adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s net income is affected by the extent to which its actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in establishing reserves for claims 
reserves for claims are established based on actuarial estimates of how much the company will need to pay for reported claims  as well as claims which have been incurred but not yet reported 
in addition  management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of reserves for claims  the company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims 
such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
to the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities  the company could be required to increase reserves 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
unfavorable economic conditions can lead to an increase in title insurance claims due to higher levels of defaults and foreclosures upon insured properties 
in addition  the company may experience unexpected large losses periodically which require it to increase its loss reserves 
deterioration of economic and credit markets may cause a decline in the performance of the company s investments and could have a material adverse affect on net income 
the company and its subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their income from short term investments and investments in investment grade municipal and corporate bonds and equity securities 
the company s investment policy is designed to balance the competing objectives of asset quality and investment income 
changes in general economic conditions  interest rates  activity levels in securities markets and other external factors could adversely affect the value of the company s investment portfolio and  in turn  the company s operating results and financial condition 
recent economic and credit market conditions have adversely affected the ability of some issuers of debt securities to repay their obligations and have affected the market values of the underlying securities 
if the carrying value of the company s investments exceeds the fair value  and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  the company will be required to write down the value of its investments  which could materially harm the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during the recent economic downturn  the company has written down the value of some of its investment portfolio 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations 
changes in regulations may have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
the company s title insurance businesses are subject to extensive state laws and regulations by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of policyholders and consumers 
the nature and extent of these laws and regulations typically involve  among other matters  licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices  including  but not limited to licensing of insurers and agents  capital and surplus requirements  approval of premium rates for insurance  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  deposits of securities for the benefit of policy holders  filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition  the amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries  establishing reserves  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  regulation of insurance  approval of policy forms  and regulations regarding the use of personal information 
the company s other businesses operate within state and federal guidelines 
any changes in the applicable regulatory environment or changes in existing regulations could restrict its existing or future operations or make it more burdensome to conduct them 
title insurance rate regulation could have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
rates for title insurance vary by state and are subject to extensive regulation 
the process of implementing a rate change in most states requires a pre approval of the applicable state insurance regulator 
this regulation could impact the company s ability to adjust prices due to changing market conditions  which could adversely affect results of operations 
weakness in the commercial real estate market could have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
through the company s title insurance subsidiaries  it issues commercial title insurance policies in connection with real estate transactions 
the commercial real estate market is currently experiencing the effects of weak demand and availability of credit and  according to the mit center for real estate  commercial real estate prices are down from their peak in mid a study by snl financial lc found that the rate of delinquency for commercial real estate was  above the national average for all real estate of 
with the possibility of further declining values of commercial property  limited credit availability  increasing defaults and foreclosures on loans secured by commercial real estate  the company could see an increase in the number of claims associated with these policies 
an increase in the amount or severity of claims could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade from a rating agency could result in a loss of underwriting business 
the competitive positions of title insurance companies rely in part on the independent ratings of their financial strength and claims paying ability 
the company s financial strength ratings are subject to continued periodic review by rating agencies and subject to change 
a significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the company s policy issuing subsidiaries could negatively impact its ability to compete for new business and retain existing business and maintain licenses necessary to operate as title insurance companies in various states 
competition affects the company s results of operations 
the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
key competitive factors in the title insurance industry are quality of service  price within regulatory parameters  expertise  timeliness and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title companies compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company owned operations and issuing agency relationships with attorneys  lenders  realtors  builders and other settlement service providers 
title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and information than the company 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company operates 
competition among the major providers of title insurance or the acceptance of new alternatives to traditional title products by the marketplace could adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s success relies on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents 
competition for skilled and experienced personnel in the company s industry is high 
the company may have difficulty hiring the necessary marketing and management personnel to support any future growth 
the loss of any key employee or the failure of any key employee to perform in their current position could prevent the company from realizing future growth potential 
also  the company cannot provide assurance that it will succeed in attracting or retaining new agents 
its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents 
insurance regulations limit the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company 
the company is an insurance holding company and it has no substantial operations of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent  among other factors  on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay intercompany loans to it 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance and other regulations that limit the amount of dividends  loans or advances to it based on the amount of adjusted unassigned surplus and net income and require these subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts of capital  surplus and reserves 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require prior state insurance regulatory approval 
these dividend restrictions could limit the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or grow its business 
the company relies upon north carolina for about of its title insurance premiums 
changes in the economic or regulatory environment in north carolina could have an adverse affect on the company 
north carolina is the largest source of revenue for the title insurance and  in  north carolina based premiums accounted for approximately of total premiums earned by the company 
a decrease in the level of real estate activity in north carolina  driven either by depressed economic conditions in the state  changes in its regulatory environment or other factors that could influence demand  could have a disproportionately negative impact on the company s financial results 
financial institution failures could adversely affect the company 
the company has substantial deposits  including deposits that are owned by third parties in financial institutions 
there is no guarantee the company  whether through the federal deposit insurance corporation or otherwise  would recover the funds it has deposited should one or more of the financial institutions at which the company maintains deposits fail 
the company may encounter difficulties managing growth or technology changes  which could adversely affect its results 
the company has historically achieved revenue growth in part through a combination of developing related new products or services and increasing its market share for existing products 
the company s future growth could come from services or geographic areas that are different from current business practices and locations with which management could be less familiar 
the expansion of the company s business  particularly in new services or geographic areas  or significant changes in technology may subject it to associated risks  such as the diversion of management s attention  lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses and a change in competitive position resulting from technology changes 
certain provisions of the company s shareholder rights plan may make a takeover of the company difficult 
the company has a shareholders rights plan which could discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the company s shareholders for their common shares

item legal proceedings a class action lawsuit is pending in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia against several title insurance companies  including investors title insurance company  entitled backel v 
fidelity national title insurance et al 
cv

in west virginia  the case has been placed on the inactive list pending the resolution of the bankruptcy of landamerica financial group  inc the company believes that this case is without merit  and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations 
at this stage in the litigation  the company does not have the ability to make a reasonable range of estimates in regards to potential loss amounts  if any 
the company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various other legal proceedings from time to time that are incidental to their business 
in the company opinion  based on the present status of these proceedings  any potential liability of the company or its subsidiaries with respect to these other legal proceedings will not  in the aggregate  be material to the company consolidated financial condition or results of operations

overview investors title company the company is a holding company that engages primarily in issuing title insurance through two subsidiaries  investors title insurance company itic and national investors title insurance company nitic 
operating revenues from the title segment accounted for of the company s operating revenues in through itic and nitic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real estate owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner has to purchase a separate owner title insurance policy to protect his investment 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake or omission in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
the company issues title insurance policies through issuing agencies and also directly through home and branch offices 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
the ability to attract and retain issuing agents is a key determinant of the company s growth in premiums written 
revenues for this segment result from purchases of new and existing residential and commercial real estate  refinance activity and certain other types of mortgage lending such as home equity lines of credit 
volume is a factor in the company profitability due to fixed operating costs which are incurred by the company regardless of premium volume 
the resulting operating leverage tends to amplify the impact of changes in volume on the company s profitability 
the company s profitability also depends  in part  upon its ability to manage its investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes  defaults and impairments of assets 
the company volume of title insurance premiums is affected by the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which includes sales  mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing 
in turn  real estate activity is generally affected by a number of factors  including the availability of mortgage credit  the cost of real estate  consumer confidence  employment and family income levels and general united states economic conditions 
availability of credit and the resulting interest rate volatility also are important factors in the level of residential and commercial real estate activity 
the cyclical nature of the residential and commercial real estate markets and consequently  the land title industry has historically caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability  and it is expected to continue to do so in the future 
additionally  there are seasonal influences in real estate activity and accordingly in revenue levels for title insurers 
other services services other than title insurance provided by operating divisions of the company that are not required to be reported separately are reported in a category called all other 
these other services include those offered by the company and by its smaller wholly owned subsidiaries  investors title exchange corporation itec  investors title accommodation corporation itac  investors trust company investors trust  investors capital management company icmc and investors title management services  inc itms 
the company s exchange services division  itec and itac  provides customer services in connection with tax deferred real property exchanges through its subsidiaries 
itec serves as a qualified intermediary in like kind exchanges of real or personal property under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in its role as qualified intermediary  itec coordinates the exchange aspects of the real estate transaction  and its duties include drafting standard exchange documents  holding the exchange funds between the sale of the old property and the purchase of the new property  and accepting the formal identification of the replacement property within the required identification period 
itac serves as exchange accommodation titleholder in reverse exchanges 
an exchange accommodation offers a vehicle for accommodating a reverse exchange when the taxpayer must acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
in conjunction with investors trust  icmc provides investment management and trust services to individuals  companies  banks and trusts 
itms offers various consulting services to provide clients with the technical expertise to start and successfully operate a title insurance agency 
business trends and recent conditions by the mid s  there had been a long term trend of rising home values in the united states that resulted in inflated home values in many areas of the country 
from to  the federal reserve lowered short term interest rates times 
sales of homes reached record highs and lenders began to loosen their loan underwriting standards  particularly in the non traditional loan markets 
these lower underwriting standards  when combined with new methods of financing non traditional loans  helped create a supply of inexpensive credit which led to a build up in mortgage loans to high risk borrowers 
subsequently  there was a substantial increase in loan defaults and mortgage foreclosures in the us economy 
during september  there were multiple financial firm failures  mergers or restructurings that led to a financial crisis and loss of confidence in the financial system 
lenders responded to the financial crisis by implementing stricter loan underwriting standards 
in addition to these tighter lending standards  high unemployment and weakened consumer confidence have reduced the demand for homes 
these factors have contributed to a lower demand for title insurance and a decline in premium volume 
in an attempt to stabilize the struggling economy  the us government took steps to provide economic stimulus during the past two years 
the economic stimulus bill included an  tax credit available for certain first time home buyers for the purchase of a principal residence on or after january  on july   the president signed a law which extended the first time homebuyer credit to persons who signed a binding purchase contract by april  and closed on the purchase of their residence by september  a similar credit of  was also extended for homebuyers who had owned their current home at least five of the prior eight years 
according to data published by freddie mac  the average year fixed mortgage interest rate in the united states decreased to for  compared with for mortgage originations were  billion and  billion in and  respectively 
the mortgage bankers association mba january  mortgage finance forecast projects mortgage originations to be billion  a decrease of approximately compared with in and  refinancing activity accounted for approximately two thirds of all mortgage originations 
in  refinancing transactions are estimated to account for only one third of total mortgage originations due to forecasted increases in mortgage interest rates 
refinancing activity is projected to decrease and purchasing activity is projected to increase from levels 
many experts predict the overall state of the economy to improve in the federal reserve has announced that it will purchase more us treasury bonds in order to reduce long term interest rates and federal lawmakers have agreed to extend certain provisions of the bush era tax cuts 
according to the january  mba economic forecast  projections show improvement in real gross domestic product  consumer spending  business and residential investments and the unemployment rate  however  due to foreclosures  tighter lending standards and continued high unemployment levels  real estate activity is expected to remain sluggish in historically  activity in real estate markets has varied over the course of market cycles in response to evolving economic factors 
operating results can vary from year to year based on cyclical market conditions and do not necessarily indicate the company future operating results and cash flows 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company management makes various estimates and judgments when applying policies affecting the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies of the company are discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are those accounting estimates and policies considered critical to the company 
reserves for claim losses the company s reserves for claims are established using estimates of amounts required to settle claims for which notice has been received reported and the amount estimated to be required to satisfy incurred claims of policyholders which may be reported in the future incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
the total reserve for all losses incurred but unpaid as of december  is represented by the reserve for claims of approximately  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
of that total  approximately  was reserved for specific claims which have been reported to the company  and approximately  was reserved for ibnr claims 
a provision for estimated future claims payments is recorded at the time the related policy revenue is recorded 
the company records the claims provision as a percentage of net premiums written 
this provisional rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies 
by their nature  title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts  vary in number due to economic and market conditions such as an increase in mortgage foreclosures and involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure 
in addition  some claims may require a number of years to settle and determine the final liability for indemnity and loss adjustment expense 
the payment experience may extend for more than twenty years after the issuance of a policy 
events such as fraud  defalcation and multiple property defects can substantially and unexpectedly cause increases in estimates of losses 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic and market conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims  actuarial projections and other relevant factors in determining its loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
in establishing reserves  actuarial projections are compared with recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded claims reserves and any necessary adjustments are then recorded in the current period s income statement 
as the most recent claims experience develops and new information becomes available  the loss reserve estimate related to prior periods will change to more accurately reflect updated and improved emerging data 
the company reflects any adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period in which new information principally claims experience becomes available 
the company initially reserves for each known claim based upon an assessment of specific facts and updates the reserve amount as necessary over the course of administering each claim 
loss ratios for earlier years tend to be more reliable than recent policy years as those years are more fully developed 
in making loss estimates  management determines a loss provision rate  which it then applies to net premiums written 
there are key assumptions that materially affect the reserve estimates 
the company assumes the aggregate reported liability for known claims and ibnr  in the aggregate  will be comparable to its historical claims experience unless factors  such as loss experience  change significantly 
the factors the company considered for the recently completed fiscal year did not cause any of its key assumptions to change from assumptions used in the immediately preceding period 
also affecting the company s assumptions are large losses related to fraud and defalcation  as these can cause significant variances in loss emergence patterns 
management defines a large loss as one where incurred losses exceed  due to the small volume of large claims  the long tail nature of title insurance claims and the inherent uncertainty in loss emergence patterns  large claim activity can vary significantly between policy years 
the estimated development of large claims by policy year is therefore subject to significant changes as experience develops 
the company has generally followed the same methodology for estimating loss reserves 
the loss provision rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies and to provide for estimated positive or negative development on prior year loss estimates 
management also considers actuarial analyses in evaluating claims reserves 
the actuarial methods used to evaluate reserves are loss development methods  expected loss methods and cape cod methods  all of which are accepted actuarial methods for estimating ultimate losses and  therefore  loss reserves 
in the loss development method  each policy year s paid or incurred losses are projected to an ultimate level using loss development factors 
in the cape cod method  expected losses for one policy year are estimated based on the loss results for the other policy years  trended to the level of the policy year being estimated 
expected loss methods produce more stable ultimate loss estimates than do loss development methods  which are more responsive to the current loss data 
the cape cod method  a special case of the bornhuetter ferguson method  blends the results of the loss development and expected loss methods 
for more recent policy years  more weight is given to the results of the expected loss methods  for older policy years  more weight is given to the loss development method results 
the key actuarial assumptions are principally loss development factors and expected loss ratios 
the selected loss development factors are based on a combination of the company s historical loss experience and title industry loss experience 
expected loss ratios are estimated for each policy year based on the company s own experience and title industry loss ratios 
when updated data is incorporated into the actuarial models  the resulting loss development factors and expected loss ratios will likely change from the prior values 
changes in these values from through have been the result of actual company and industry experience during the calendar year and not changes in assumptions 
if one or more of the variables or assumptions used changed such that the company s recorded loss ratio  or loss provision as a percentage of net title premiums  increased or decreased two loss ratio percentage points  the impact on after tax income for the year ended december   would be as follows 
company management believes that using a sensitivity of two loss percentage points for the loss ratio provides a reasonable benchmark for analysis of the calendar year loss provision of the company based on historical loss ratios by year 
increase in loss ratio of two percentage points decrease in loss ratio of two percentage points despite the variability of such estimates  management believes that  based on historical claims experience and actuarial analysis  the reserves are adequate to cover claim losses resulting from pending and future claims for policies issued through december  the ultimate settlement of policy and contract claims will likely vary from the reserve estimates included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company continually reviews and adjusts its reserve estimates to reflect its loss experience and any new information that becomes available 
there are no known claims that are expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company financial position or operating results 
premiums written and commissions to agents generally  title insurance premiums are recognized at the time of closing of the related real estate transaction  as the earnings process is then considered complete 
policies or commitments are issued upon receipt of final certificates or preliminary reports with respect to titles 
title insurance commissions earned by the company agents are recognized as expenses concurrent with recognition of related premium revenue 
valuation and impairment of investments in securities securities for which the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts and other than temporary declines in fair value 
securities held principally for resale in the near term are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair values 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in other income 
securities not classified as either trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  adjusted for other than temporary declines in fair value  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december  and  substantially all of the company s invested assets were classified as available for sale 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined using the specific identification method 
securities are regularly evaluated and reviewed for differences between the cost and estimated fair value of each security for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
when  in the opinion of management  a decline in the fair value of an investment is considered to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its fair value 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include  but are not limited to the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  with respect to equity securities  whether the company s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time is sufficient to allow for a recovery in value  and with respect to fixed maturity securities  whether the company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before recovery in value 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and any material degradation in the prospect for recovery will be considered in the other than temporary impairment analysis 
such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss 
the fair values of the majority of the company s investments are based on quoted market prices from independent pricing services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k for further information on the company s valuation techniques 
deferred tax asset the company recorded net deferred tax assets at december  and related primarily to reserves for claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  employee benefits and other than temporary impairment of assets 
based upon the company historical results of operations  the existing financial condition of the company and management assessment of all other available information  management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit of these assets will be realized 
results of operations operating revenues operating revenues include net premiums written plus other fee income  trust income  management services income  and exchange services income 
investment income and realized investment gains and losses are not included in operating revenues and are discussed separately following operating revenues 
following is a summary of the company operating revenues 
intersegment eliminations have been netted with each segment  therefore  the individual segment amounts will not agree to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
title insurance all other title insurance net premiums net premiums written decreased in from purchase transactions increased approximately in from levels however  this was offset by a decrease of in refinancing activity  resulting in an overall decrease in premium volume 
title orders the volume of title orders decreased in to  compared with  in the company believes that the weak housing market and the decrease in refinancing activity were the primary reasons for the decline in order counts 
title insurance companies typically issue title insurance policies directly through branch offices or through title agencies 
following is a breakdown of premiums generated by branch and agency operations for the years ended december branch agency total home and branch office net premiums in the company s home and branch operations  the company issues the insurance policy and retains the entire premium  as no commissions are paid 
home and branch office net premiums written as a percentage of total net premiums written  were and in and  respectively 
net premiums written from home and branch operations decreased in compared with the decrease in primarily reflects a decline in mortgage refinancing from the prior year 
all of the company s home office operations and the majority of branch offices are located in north carolina  as a result  the home and branch office net premiums written are primarily from north carolina business 
agency net premiums agents retain the majority of the title premium collected  with the balance remitted to the title underwriter for bearing the risk of loss in the event that a claim is made under the title insurance policy 
agency net premiums written as a percentage of total net premiums written were and in and  respectively 
net premiums written from agency operations increased in compared with the increase in the percentage of total premiums written by agencies in is primarily due to the company s strategy of growth through expansion of its agency base and the influence of local geographic trends 
following is a schedule of net premiums written in select states where the company s two insurance subsidiaries itic and nitic currently underwrite title insurance state north carolina south carolina virginia michigan kentucky all others direct premiums reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded net premiums written premiums for all other states increased primarily from the company s agency expansion into the state of texas 
other revenues other revenues primarily include other fee income  trust income  management services income  exchange services income  and income related to the company s equity method investments 
other revenues were  and  for and  respectively 
the decline in is related primarily to decreases in exchange service revenues and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  partially offset by an increase in management services income 
cyclicality and seasonality title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and real estate values 
the availability of credit directly affects real estate sales 
home sales and mortgage lending are highly cyclical businesses 
other factors include mortgage interest rates  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand of real estate  and family income levels 
the company s premiums in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond management s control and  as a result  likely to fluctuate 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal premium levels for title insurers 
residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the fall and winter months because fewer real estate transactions occur  while the spring and summer months are more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal than purchase activity  but it is more subject to interest rate volatility and is therefore more cyclical 
however  fluctuations in mortgage interest rates  as well as other economic factors  can cause shifts in real estate activity outside of the normal traditional seasonal pattern 
non operating revenues investment income and realized gains and losses from investments are included in non operating revenues 
investment income the company derives a substantial portion of its income from investments in municipal and corporate bonds and equity securities 
the company title insurance subsidiaries are required by statute to maintain minimum levels of investments in order to protect the interests of policyholders 
bonds totaling approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  are deposited with the insurance departments of the states in which business is conducted 
in formulating its investment strategy  the company has emphasized after tax income 
the company s investments are primarily in bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
the effective maturity of the majority of the bonds is within years 
the company s invested assets are managed to fund its obligations and evaluated to ensure long term stability of capital accounts 
as the company generates cash from operations  it is invested in accordance with the company s investment policy and corporate goals 
the company s investment policies have been designed to balance multiple goals  including the assurance of a stable source of income from interest and dividends  the preservation of principle  and the provision of liquidity sufficient to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future 
securities purchased may include a combination of taxable bonds  tax exempt bonds and equity securities 
the company strives to maintain a high quality investment portfolio 
interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of general market performance  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
investment income was  in compared with  in the decline in investment income in was due primarily to lower levels of interest earned on short term funds and the maturity of older securities which yielded higher rates of interest relative to current investments 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the major categories of investments  scheduled maturities  amortized cost  fair values of investment securities and earnings by security category 
net realized gain loss on investments dispositions of equity securities at a realized gain or loss reflect such factors as industry sector allocation decisions  ongoing assessments of issuers business prospects and tax planning considerations 
additionally  the amounts of net realized investment gains and losses are affected by assessments of securities valuation for other than temporary impairment 
as a result of the interaction of these factors and considerations  net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly from period to period 
net realized gain on investments was  for  compared with a net realized loss of  for the year to date net gain included impairment charges of  on certain investments in the company s portfolio that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  offset by net realized gains on the sales of investments of  the net loss included impairment charges of  on certain investments offset by net realized gains on the sales of investments of  management believes unrealized losses on remaining fixed income and equity securities at december  are temporary in nature 
the securities in the company s portfolio are subject to economic conditions and market risks 
the company considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest related impairment of a security is other than temporary 
relevant facts and circumstances include the extent and length of time the fair value of an investment has been below cost 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated  the risk that the company s assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the characteristics of that issuer  the risk that information obtained by the company or changes in other facts and circumstances leads management to change its intent to hold the equity security until it recovers in value or its intent to sell the debt security  and the risk that management is making decisions based on misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers 
expenses the company s operating expenses consist primarily of commissions to agents  salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes  provisions for claims and office occupancy and operations 
operating expenses in decreased compared with primarily due to decreases in the provision for claims  salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes and office occupancy and operations  partially offset by an increase in commissions 
following is a summary of the company operating expenses 
intersegment eliminations have been netted  therefore  the individual segment amounts will not agree to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
title insurance all other the company s net profit margin was in and in total revenues remained relatively unchanged for and operating expenses decreased  contributing to a higher combined profit margin for the company continually strives to enhance its competitive strengths and market position  including ongoing initiatives to reduce its operating expenses 
title insurance profit margin the company s title insurance profit margin varies according to a number of factors  including the volume and type of real estate activity 
profit margins for the title insurance segment were and in and  respectively 
commissions agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts 
commissions to agents increased from to primarily due to increased premiums from agency operations in commission expense as a percentage of net premiums written by agents was and in and  respectively 
commission rates vary by the geographic area in which the commission is paid and may be influenced by state regulations 
provisions for claims the provision for claims as a percentage of net premiums written was and in and  respectively 
factors resulting in the lower loss provision rate in include a lower estimated loss ratio for  favorable experience related to prior policy years and a recovery of approximately  related to a claim filed against the company s fidelity bond for losses recognized in a prior year 
the decrease in the loss provision in from the level resulted in approximately  less in reserves than would have been recorded at the higher level 
loss provision ratios are subject to variability and are reviewed and adjusted as experience develops 
title claims are typically reported and paid within the first several years of policy issuance 
the provision for claims reflects actual payments of claims  net of recovery amounts  plus adjustments to the specific and incurred but not reported claims reserves  the latter of which are actuarially determined based on historical claims experience 
actual payments of claims  net of recoveries  were  and  in and  respectively 
changes in the expected liability for claims for prior periods reflect the uncertainty of the claims environment  as well as the limited predictive power of historical data 
the company continually updates and refines its reserve estimates as current experience develops and credible data emerges 
adjustments may be required as new information develops which often varies from past experience 
movements in the reserves related to prior periods were primarily the result of changes to estimates to better reflect the latest reported loss data  rather than as a result of material changes to underlying key actuarial assumptions or methodologies 
such changes include payments on claims closed during the quarter  new details that emerge on still open cases that cause claims adjusters to increase or decrease the case reserves and the impact that these types of changes have on the company s total loss provision 
see critical accounting estimates and policies for further discussion related to the company s reserves for claim losses and the related changes 
salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes personnel costs include base salaries  benefits and bonuses paid to employees 
salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes were  and  for and  respectively 
salaries and related costs decreased by approximately  or in compared with the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and a related reduction in employee benefit expenses 
on a consolidated basis  salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues were and in and  respectively 
office occupancy and operations overall office occupancy and operations as a percentage of total revenues was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in office occupancy and operations expense in compared with was due primarily to decreases in depreciation related to assets becoming fully depreciated  telecommunications  rent and printing 
telecommunications  rent and printing decreased primarily due to initiatives to reduce operating costs 
premium and retaliatory taxes title insurance companies are generally not subject to state income or franchise taxes 
however  in most states they are subject to premium and retaliatory taxes  as defined by statute 
premium tax rates vary from state to state  accordingly  the total premium tax burden is dependent upon the geographical mix of operating revenues 
premium and retaliatory taxes as a percentage of net premiums written were and for and  respectively 
professional and contract labor fees professional and contract labor expenses for increased  compared with primarily due to increases in fees associated with contract labor related to the expansion into the state of texas and banking industry professional fees 
business development business development expenses for increased  compared with primarily due to increases in travel related expenses related to the expansion into the state of texas and a higher level of marketing efforts 
other expenses other operating expenses primarily include miscellaneous operating expenses of the trust division and other miscellaneous expenses of the title segment 
these amounts typically fluctuate with transaction volume of the title segment and the trust division 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase for from was primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable to tax exempt investment income 
the effective income tax rate for both and was below the us federal statutory income tax rate  primarily due to the effect of tax exempt income 
tax exempt income lowers the effective tax rate 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with recognized  impairment and unrecognized losses recorded through december  will be realized 
however  this judgment could be impacted by further market fluctuations 
information regarding the components of the income tax expense and items included in the reconciliation of the effective rate with the federal statutory rate can be found in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net income the company reported net income of  and  or and per share on a diluted basis in and  respectively 
total revenues for remained virtually unchanged while expenses for decreased to  from  operational expenses compared favorably to the prior year period primarily due to decreases in the provisions for claims  salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes and office occupancy and operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash flows from operating activities decreased from to  primarily due to a recovery of current income taxes receivable in  a decrease in premiums collected in coupled with an increase in receivables and other assets  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash and cash equivalents at year end decreased approximately  from the prior year to approximately  due to cash provided by operating activities in due to the company s historical consistent ability to generate positive cash flows from its consolidated operations and investment income  management believes that funds generated from operations will enable the company to adequately meet its current operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that future experience will be similar to historical experience  since it is influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment  the company s claims paying ability and its financial strength ratings 
the company is unaware of any trend that is likely to result in material adverse liquidity changes  but continually assesses its capital allocation strategy  including decisions relating to repurchasing the company s stock and or conserving cash 
the company s current cash requirements include general operating expenses  income taxes  capital expenditures  dividends on its common stock declared by the board of directors and share repurchases of its common stock 
in addition to operational liquidity  the company maintains a high degree of liquidity within its investment portfolio in the form of short term investments and other readily marketable securities 
the company s investment portfolio is considered as available for sale 
the company reviews the status of each of its securities quarterly to determine whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
cash flows net cash flows provided by operating activities were  and  in and  respectively 
the primary use of cash in operations was payments of claims of  and  in and  respectively 
cash flows from operations have historically been the primary source of financing for expanding operations  additions to property and equipment  dividends to shareholders  and operating requirements 
the principal non operating use of cash and cash equivalents in and was for purchases to the investment portfolio and  to a lesser extent  dividends paid and repurchases of common stock 
the net effect of all activities on total cash and cash equivalents was a decrease of  for and an increase of  for as of december   the company held cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  fixed maturity securities of  and equity securities of  as noted previously  the company s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the real estate market 
the company s business has certain fixed costs such as personnel  therefore  changes in the real estate market are monitored closely and operating expenses such as staffing levels  are managed and adjusted accordingly 
the company believes that its significant working capital position and management of operating expenses will aid its ability to manage cash resources through fluctuations in the real estate market 
receipt of dividends from subsidiaries the company believes that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds  through cash dividends and distributions from subsidiaries and cash generated by investment securities 
the company s significant sources of funds are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries 
the holding company receives cash from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursements for operating and other administrative expenses that it incurs 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements between the holding company and its subsidiaries 
the company ability to pay dividends and operating expenses is dependent on funds received from the insurance subsidiaries  which are subject to regulation in the states in which they do business 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which the company s title underwriters can pay dividends or make distributions 
as of december   approximately  of the consolidated stockholders equity represented net assets of the company subsidiaries that cannot be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company under statutory regulations without prior insurance department approval 
these regulations  among other things  require prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany transfers 
the company believes  however  that amounts available for transfer from the insurance and other subsidiaries are adequate to meet the company current operating needs 
the maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends  which may be constrained by regulatory and business considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  which could affect an insurer s ratings 
further  depending on regulatory and business conditions  the company may in the future need to retain cash in its underwriters in order to maintain their ratings or their statutory capital position 
such requirements could be the result of adverse financial results  changes in interpretation of statutory accounting requirements by regulators  reserve charges or investment losses
