overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our supplies high performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp polishes surfaces at an atomic level  thereby enabling ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp consumables 
we develop  produce and sell cmp slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in ic devices  and also for polishing the disk substrates and magnetic heads used in hard disk drives 
we also develop  manufacture and sell cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we also pursue other demanding surface modification applications through our engineered surface finishes esf business where we believe we can leverage our expertise in cmp consumables for the semiconductor industry to develop products for demanding polishing applications in other industries 
the economic and industry growth that we saw during fiscal in the overall semiconductor industry and for our company continued into fiscal unit growth in the semiconductor industry has been driven in particular by increased demand for mobile internet products such as smart phones and tablets 
however  we began to see a softening of demand within the semiconductor industry in the second half of fiscal based on certain factors including general uncertainty in the global economy and a modest correction of ic inventory 
some industry analysts project that this softening of demand may continue through the first half of our fiscal consequently  we remain cautious regarding demand trends in fiscal there are many factors  that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including those discussed in part i  item a entitled risk factors in this form k 
our fiscal performance was highlighted by a number of strategic investments we made to further strengthen our global position for the future 
we completed construction of a new research  development and manufacturing facility in south korea  which we believe will strengthen our ability to serve the second largest cmp market in the world 
we expanded our manufacturing facility in japan to meet increased demand for our cmp slurry products and we expanded our manufacturing facility in singapore to meet higher demand for our data storage products 
we also developed and commercialized innovative new products in all of our business areas to address traditional cmp applications as well as new and emerging technologies 

index revenue for fiscal was million  which represented an increase of from the million reported for fiscal  and was a record level for our company 
the increase in revenue from fiscal reflects increased sales volume primarily due to continued growth of the semiconductor industry 
we experienced revenue growth across all of our product lines  including each of our slurry areas  our polishing pads business and our esf business 
we also experienced revenue growth in each geographic area in which we operate  except in japan  including a increase in revenue in south korea 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents a decrease from the reported for fiscal  but was within our full year guidance range of to of revenue 
the decrease in gross profit percentage from fiscal was primarily due to higher fixed manufacturing costs  the negative effects of foreign exchange rate changes  particularly with respect to the us dollar against the japanese yen  which accounted for approximately a percentage point decrease in gross margin percentage  and selective price decreases  partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
we expect our gross profit percentage for full fiscal year to be in the range of to 
our fiscal guidance reflects anticipated continued adverse impacts of foreign exchange rate changes  fixed costs associated with our new facility in south korea and uncertainty within the semiconductor industry and the global economy 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity and changes in our product mix  which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
operating expenses of million  which include research  development and technical  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  increased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher staffing related costs and higher expenses for clean room materials  partially offset by lower professional fees 
in fiscal  we expect our full year operating expenses to be in the range of million to million 
diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased  or  from reported in fiscal  and represented a record level for our company 
the increase was primarily due to increased sales volume  partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage  higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate 
the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  include certain adjustments to correct prior period amounts  which we have determined to be immaterial to the current period and the prior periods to which they relate 
adjustments in fiscal listed below  the first four of which were made in the first two quarters  are related to million million  net of tax in employer paid fringe benefits for required contributions to our k plan  supplemental employee retirement plan  and non united states statutory pension plans as a result of our annual payment pursuant to our fiscal annual incentive cash bonus program aip  income tax expense of million recorded for certain compensation in fiscal through for which a previous tax benefit should not have been recorded  the reversal of a million deferred tax asset regarding certain share based compensation expense which is not subject to such tax treatment  our under accrual of million million  net of tax for payments made pursuant to the aip as a result of the calculation of results against goals under the aip  and other immaterial corrections to deferred tax assets and liabilities that reduced our income tax expense by million 
collectively  prior period adjustments reduced net income in fiscal by million and diluted earnings per share by approximately 

index critical accounting policies and estimates this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  valuation and classification of auction rate securities  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
in fiscal  the global economic recession adversely affected our ability to collect accounts receivable from some of our customers 
the recession also caused a small number of our customers to file for bankruptcy or insolvency 
we recorded a million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal to account for these bankruptcies and the increased risk regarding customer collections due to the continued uncertainty in the global economy 
we will continue to monitor the financial solvency of our customers and  if global economic conditions worsen  we may have to record additional increases to our allowances for doubtful accounts 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expenses would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventories written off applied against the inventory value at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
if we had increased our reserve for obsolete inventory at september  by  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 

index valuation and classification of auction rate securities as of september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value which are classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in general  ars investments are securities with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction every seven to days 
historically  these periodic auctions provided a liquid market for these securities 
general uncertainties in the global credit markets reduced liquidity in the ars market  and this illiquidity continues 
as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have recorded a temporary impairment of million  net of tax  in the value of one of our ars in other comprehensive income 
the calculation of fair value and the balance sheet classification for our ars requires critical judgments and estimates by management including an appropriate discount rate and the probabilities that a security may be monetized through a future successful auction  of a refinancing of the underlying debt  of a default in payment by the issuer  and of payments not being made by the bond insurance carrier in the event of default by the issuer 
an other than temporary impairment must be recorded when a credit loss exists  that is when the present value of the expected cash flows from a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
we performed two discounted cash flow analyses  one using a discount rate based on a market index comprised of tax exempt variable rate demand obligations and one using a discount rate based on the libor swap curve  and we applied a risk factor to reflect current liquidity issues in the ars market 
key inputs to our discounted cash flow model include projected cash flows from interest and principal payments and the weighted probabilities of improved liquidity or debt refinancing by the issuer 
we also incorporate certain level market indices into the discounted cash flow analysis  including published rates such as the libor rate  the libor swap curve and a municipal swap index published by the securities industry and financial markets association 
we also considered the probability of default in payment by the issuer of the securities  the strength of the insurance backing and the probability of failure by the insurance carrier in the case of default by the issuer of the securities 
in november  the municipality that issued our impaired ars filed for bankruptcy protection 
we considered these developments  in light of the continued insurance backing  and have concluded the impairment we have maintained remains adequate and temporary 
we do not intend to sell the securities at a loss and we believe we will not be required to sell the securities at a loss in the future 
if auctions involving our remaining ars continue to fail  if issuers of our ars are unable to refinance the underlying securities  if the issuing municipalities are unable to pay their debt obligations and the bond insurance fails  or if credit ratings decline or other adverse developments occur in the credit markets  we may not be able to monetize our remaining securities in the near term and may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these instruments through an impairment charge that may be deemed other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  an impairment provision may be required 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the net book value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values require significant judgment and are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
as a result of assessments performed during fiscal  we recorded million in impairment expense 
in fiscal and  we recorded million and million in impairment expense  respectively 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 

index business combinations we have accounted for all business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
as discussed in more detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we were required to adopt new accounting standards for business combinations commencing after october  however  we have not made any acquisitions to which we were required to apply these new standards 
we have allocated the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
contingent consideration was recorded as a liability when the outcome of the contingency became determinable 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
purchased ipr d  for which technological feasibility has not yet been established and no future alternative uses exist  has been expensed immediately 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the products when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may cause actual realized values to be different from management s estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate other long lived assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discreet financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we had three reporting units to which we allocated goodwill and intangible assets as of september   the date of our annual impairment test 
initially  our company had only one reporting unit as we were created from a division of our former parent company  cabot corporation  and we identified associated goodwill and intangible assets under one reporting unit at that time 
other amounts of goodwill and intangible assets have been attributed to acquired businesses at the time of acquisition through the use of independent appraisal firms 
we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis step one analysis of our projected future results 
the step one analysis we performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal indicated the fair value of our reporting units was significantly higher than the carrying value 
as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  effective september   we adopted new accounting pronouncements related to our goodwill impairment analysis 
the new accounting guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount step zero analysis 
in fiscal  we used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill because our cash flows for all of our reporting units exceeded the expectations we had as of september  the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured using the royalty savings method 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  royalty rates and tax rates  among others 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis that impact these assumptions may result in future impairment charges 
as a result of the review performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets as of september  
index share based compensation we record share based compensation expense for all share based awards  including stock option grants  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
we calculate share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards expected to ultimately vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience  but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the price volatility of the underlying stock  the expected term of our stock options and the risk free interest rate 
a small change in the underlying assumptions can have a relatively large effect on the estimated valuation 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock based on a combination of our stock s historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
we calculate the expected term of our stock options using the simplified method  due to our limited amount of historical option exercise data  and we add a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement eligible pursuant to terms of their award agreements during the contractual term 
the simplified method uses an average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option to calculate the expected term 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards represents the closing price of our common stock on the date of award 
accounting for income taxes current income taxes are determined based on estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
provisions are made for both us and any foreign deferred income tax liability or benefit 
we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
in fiscal and  we elected to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us rather than repatriating the earnings to the us see the section titled liquidity and capital resources in this md a and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and permanent reinvestment 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into certain unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements on a quarterly basis and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

index results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in revenue was driven by a million increase in sales volume  a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes  and a million increase due to a higher priced product mix 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in revenue due to a lower weighted average selling price for our cmp consumables 
the economic and industry growth that we saw during fiscal continued into fiscal however  we saw some softening of demand in the semiconductor industry in the second half of fiscal based on certain factors  including general uncertainty in the global economy and a modest correction of integrated circuit ic device inventory 
some industry analysts currently project this softening of demand to persist through the first half of our fiscal  so we are cautious regarding future demand trends within the semiconductor industry 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million from increased sales volume due to the increased demand for our products  a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes  a million increase due to higher fixed manufacturing costs  a million increase due to higher freight and packaging costs  a million increase due to certain production variances and a million increase due to higher sample costs 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in cost of goods sold due to a lower cost product mix 

index metal oxides  such as silica and alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more financial information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  a number of factors could impact the future cost of raw materials  packaging  freight and labor 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher fixed manufacturing costs  the negative effects of foreign exchange rate changes  selective price decreases and the absence of a raw material supplier credit we recognized in the first quarter of fiscal related to our achieving a certain volume threshold in calendar  partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
we expect our gross profit percentage for full fiscal year to be in the range of to 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity and changes in our product mix  which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  related to higher staffing levels and separation costs related to the transition of one of our executive officers  and million in higher expenses for clean room materials 
our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp consumable products  including collaborating on joint development projects with our customers  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  technical support of cmp products in our customers manufacturing facilities  and evaluation and development of new polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  million in higher travel related costs and million in higher miscellaneous selling expenses 

index general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to million in lower professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property  partially offset by million in higher staffing related costs and million in higher depreciation expense 
see part i  item entitled legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the enforcement of our intellectual property 
other income expense  net other expense was million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the increase in other expense was primarily due to million in foreign exchange effects  primarily related to changes in the exchange rate of the japanese yen and the new taiwan dollar to the us dollar  net of the gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due a number of factors related to share based compensation expense  including tax impacts of stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock for certain employees  and taxable executive compensation in excess of limits defined in section m of the internal revenue code  partially offset by the reinstatement of the us research and experimentation tax credit in december  which was retroactively effective as of january  as discussed in the overview section of this md a  our income tax provision in fiscal included adjustments to correct prior period amounts  including million in tax expense related to executive compensation in fiscal through for which a previous tax benefit should not have been recorded  and the reversal of a million deferred tax asset related to certain share based compensation expense 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales volume  partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage  increased operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate 
year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in revenue was driven by a million increase in sales volume  a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes  and million due to a slightly higher priced product mix  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million due to a lower weighted average selling price for our cmp consumable products 
we began to see improvement in economic and industry conditions during the second half of our fiscal these improvements  particularly in the semiconductor industry  continued through our fiscal and positively impacted the demand for our products 

index cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million from increased sales volume due to the increased demand for our products associated with the economic and industry recovery  and an million increase due to higher fixed costs 
these costs were partially offset by a million decrease due to higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity on the increased sales volume  and a million benefit of a lower cost product mix 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the significant increase in sales volume and the related increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  as well as a higher valued product mix  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average selling price of our cmp slurries and increased fixed manufacturing costs 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was mainly due to million in higher staffing related costs  primarily related to our aip  million in higher travel related costs  and million in higher office equipment expenses  partially offset by the absence of million in pre tax impairment charges recorded on certain research and development equipment during fiscal selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our aip  million in higher travel related costs  million in higher depreciation expense  and million in higher professional fees 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was mainly due to million in higher staffing related costs  primarily related to our aip  million in higher professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property  and million in higher travel related expenses  partially offset by million due to lower bad debt expense 
see part i  item entitled legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the enforcement of our intellectual property 
purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development ipr d expense was million in fiscal  related to the acquisition of epoch in the second quarter of fiscal we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 
index other income expense  net other expense was million in fiscal  compared to other income of million during fiscal the decrease in other income was primarily due to million in lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on our cash balances and investments  and million due to net unfavorable foreign exchange effects  primarily related to changes in the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar  net of the gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decreases in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to our election to permanently reinvest earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the us  as well as decreased tax expense related to share based compensation 
increases in the effective tax rate in fiscal that partially offset these decreases included decreases in tax exempt interest income and the expiration of the research and experimentation tax credit effective december   which was not retroactively reinstated for our fiscal until the first quarter of our fiscal net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
the election to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us increased net income by million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal originated from million in net income  million in non cash items  and a million increase in cash flow due to a net decrease in working capital 
the increase in cash from operations in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased net income and deferred tax expense  as well as decreased accounts receivable in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in working capital associated with higher inventories and lower accrued expenses and accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to improved cash collections in fiscal the increase in inventories was primarily due to a general inventory build to meet the increased customer demand we experienced in fiscal the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment made in the first quarter of fiscal of our fiscal annual incentive cash bonus  partially offset by the accrual of our fiscal annual incentive cash bonus  which we expect will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal we used million in investing activities in fiscal representing million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and million in other investing cash outflows 
capital expenditures in fiscal included the construction of our new facility in south korea and capacity expansions of our japan and singapore facilities  net of the amounts that remain in accounts payable and accrued expenses at year end 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal representing million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and million in other investing cash outflows 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal  representing million used for our acquisition of epoch  net of million in cash acquired  and million in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on business combinations and intangible assets 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be between million and million

in november  the scheduled termination date was extended by one year through october and in august  the scheduled termination date was extended another year through october under this agreement  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the lending institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we also pay a non use fee 
loans under this facility are intended primarily for general corporate purposes  including financing working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
as of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of which was held at foreign subsidiaries in singapore and taiwan where we have made a current election to permanently reinvest the earnings rather than repatriate the earnings to the us if we choose to repatriate these earnings in the future through dividends or loans to the us parent company  the earnings could become subject to additional income tax expense 
we believe that our current balance of cash and long term investments  cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  general merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to further expand our business  therefore  we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
depending upon conditions in the capital and credit markets  we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and the new taiwan dollar 
as noted in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the negative effects of foreign exchange rate changes  primarily related to the japanese yen  accounted for an approximate percentage point decline in our gross profit margin in fiscal compared to fiscal from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our balance sheet 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
during fiscal  we recorded million in foreign currency translation gains that are included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains primarily relate to the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in the japanese yen and the new taiwan dollar at period end exchange rates 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
however  we also incur expenses in foreign countries that are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar  which reduces the net exposure on the consolidated statement of income 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk over the past months  there has been a significant weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen  which has had some negative impact on our results of operations 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical additional adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures 
market risk related to investments in auction rate securities at september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with a total estimated fair value of million million par value which were classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in  general uncertainties in the global credit markets significantly reduced liquidity in the ars market  and this illiquidity continues
