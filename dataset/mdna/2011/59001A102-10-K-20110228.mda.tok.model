item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions during  the economic downturn and high unemployment rates persisted  which continued to negatively impact demand in the homebuilding industry 
based on statistics from realtytrac  processed foreclosures reached over one million in  the highest annual number of foreclosures since the downturn began 
these record high foreclosure rates contributed to the continued high housing inventory levels and  coupled with limited availability of mortgage financing resulting from the turmoil in the financial industry in prior years  exerted further pressure on home prices 
consumer confidence remained weak  despite the affordability of new homes and historic low interest rates 
we believe that the demand we experienced in the second half of after the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit reflected homebuyers reluctance to make a purchasing decision until they are comfortable that economic conditions have stabilized 
although we are seeing some signs of the beginning of a recovery in certain markets and expect the second half of to improve as the economy begins to recover  we believe the current conditions could continue  and we expect that our operations will remain relatively flat until the entire us economy rebounds 
summary company results total home closing revenue was million for the year ended december   decreasing from million for and from billion in we generated net income for of million compared to a loss of million in and million in our results include million of real estate related impairments  a million loss from early extinguishment of debt  and a million tax benefit 
in  results included million of real estate related impairments  million gain from early extinguishment of debt  and an million deferred tax valuation allowance charge 
in  we incurred million of real estate related impairments  and had an additional charge of million related to our deferred tax asset valuation 
higher average home prices from the prior years are indicative of a shift to in fill markets and different geographies  such as california  florida  and colorado during as compared to and at december   our backlog of million was down from million at december  our december  backlog was million 
fewer home sales per community and a slightly lower active community count in the second half of were primarily responsible for the decline in ending backlog 
our average sales price for homes in backlog decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily due to mix of homes 
our cancellation rate on sales orders as a percentage of gross sales decreased in to  from and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  reflecting some stabilization of home prices and consumer confidence during the year 
our cancellation rates during returned to their historical levels 
company actions and positioning in response to the sustained and extended downturn in our industry  to strengthen our balance sheet we continue to focus on the following initiatives redesigning product offering to reduce costs and sales prices  tailoring our product to meet today s buyers affordability demands  changing sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic  renegotiating construction costs with our subcontractors where possible  exercising tight control over cash flows  managing our total lot supply by actively contracting new well priced lots in strategic submarkets  monitoring our customer satisfaction scores and working toward improving them based on the results of the surveys  executing our company wide operating strategy  meritage forward  and the roll out of associated initiatives such as the simply smart series  day closing guarantee and meritage green that create market differentiation for our product offerings  and continuing to consolidate overhead functions at all of our divisions and corporate offices to hold down general and administrative cost burden 

table of contents in a response to our strategy to take advantage of capital raising opportunities we completed the following transactions during  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at of par value to yield 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we purchased all of our million senior notes maturing and million of our senior notes maturing in connection with these transactions  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  which is reflected in our statement of operations for the year ended december  this transaction pushed out our earliest maturity from to and reduced our maturity by million 
during we retired million of our senior subordinated notes maturing in by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions at a average discount from the face value of the notes  resulting in a million gain on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  during  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we used the proceeds received from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the net proceeds from this offering were million 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates and could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a home sale when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
although there is limited subjectivity in this accounting policy  we have designated revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of this balance in our statements of operations 
real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community or land is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community  less impairments  if any 
land and development costs are typically allocated to and transferred to homes under construction when construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated to the remaining homes in the community or phase 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
therefore  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 

table of contents typically  an entitled community s life cycle ranges from three to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the land and continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community  the absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw land or finished lots 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby extending the lives of certain communities 
all of our land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability at least quarterly  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
if an asset is deemed not recoverable  we are required to record impairment charges to the extent the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis and actual results may also differ from our assumptions 
our analysis is completed at a community level with each community or land parcel evaluated individually 
we pay particular attention to communities experiencing a larger than anticipated reduction in their absorption rates or averages sales prices or where gross margins are trending lower than anticipated 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the assets carrying balance exceeds their fair value 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
existing and continuing communities when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from existing communities are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are deemed not fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
the fair value of the community s assets is determined using either a discounted cash flow model for projects we intend to build out or a market based approach for projects to be sold 
impairments are charged to cost of home closings in the period during which the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
if a market based approach is used  we determine fair value based on recent comparable purchase and sales activity in the local market  adjusted for known variances as determined by our knowledge of the region and general real estate expertise 
if a discounted cash flow approach is used  we compute fair value based on a proprietary model 
our key estimates in deriving fair value under our cash flow model are i home selling prices in the community adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected sales absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace and expected cancellation rates  iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned and v our discount rate  which is currently and varies based on the perceived risk inherent in the community s other cash flow assumptions 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
community level factors that may impact our key estimates include the presence and significance of local competitors  including their offered product type and competitive actions  economic and related demographic conditions for the population of the surrounding community  desirability of the particular community  including unique amenities or other favorable or unfavorable attributes  and existing home inventory supplies 
these local circumstances may significantly impact our assumptions and the resulting computation of fair value  and are  therefore  closely evaluated by our division personnel in their creation of the discounted cash flow models 
the models are also evaluated by regional and corporate personnel for consistency and integration  as decisions that affect pricing or absorption at one community may have resulting consequences for neighboring communities 
we typically do not project market improvements in our discounted cash flow models  but may do so in limited circumstances in the latter years of a long lived community 
in certain cases  we may elect to stop development of mothball an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow market conditions to improve 
the decision may be based on financial and or operational metrics 
if we decide to mothball a project  we will impair it to its fair value as discussed above and then cease future development activity until such a time where management believes that market conditions will improve and economic performance will be maximized 
quarterly  we review all communities  including mothballed communities  for potential impairments 

table of contents option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing and continuing communities section above  we determine if the contributions to be generated by our future communities are acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that a community is still meeting our internal investment guidelines and is generating a profit  those assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we decide to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
in certain circumstances  we may also elect to continue with a project because it is expected to generate positive future cash flows  even though it may not be generating an accounting profit  or because of other strategic factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
due to the complexity and subjectivity of these fair value computations  as well as the significance of associated impairments to our financial statements for the past several years  we have concluded that the valuation of our real estate and associated assets is a critical accounting policy 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land inventories and real estate related joint venture investments 
additionally  we wrote off approximately million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer economically feasible 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding these impairments and the associated remaining fair values of impaired communities 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are  during applicable warranty periods  ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover our exposure to absorb the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors as they relate to warranty type claims subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and  with the assistance of an actuary  we determine their sufficiency based on our and industry wide historical data and trends with respect to product types and geographical areas 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting an accrual of to of a home s sale price depending on our loss history in the geographic area in which the home was built 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by approximately  in while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have invested in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
all unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by either the cost or the equity method of accounting as the criteria for consolidation set forth in asc  consolidation  have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings loss from unconsolidated entities  net 
in order to determine if we should consolidate equity basis joint ventures  we determine if the ventures are vies and if we are the primary beneficiary of the unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include our ability to control the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance  and in cases where we do control such activities  if we also are expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or expected gains of the entity 
as of december   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary  we have a significant influence  and our ownership interest exceeds 
at december   we had investments of million related to equity method unconsolidated entities with total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 

table of contents we enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we also analyze these agreements under asc to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity vie  if applicable  using a similar analysis  as noted above 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  even though we do not have title to such land  we are required to consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies are excluded from our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including the benefit from nols  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
companies must assess  using significant judgments  whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating losses and our experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
based upon a review of all available evidence  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during we continue to maintain a full non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets at december  as we have determined that the weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and it continues to be more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million million federal and million state and million million federal and million state  respectively  against deferred tax assets which include the tax benefit from nol carryovers 
our future deferred tax asset realization depends on sufficient taxable income in the carryforward periods under existing tax laws 
federal net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for years and expire in state net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for a period of time ranging from to years  depending on the state  and begin to expire in deferred tax assets include tax effected federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million in and  respectively 
on an ongoing basis  we will continue to review all available evidence to determine if and when we expect to realize our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock units nonvested shares outstanding under two stock compensation plans 
per the terms of these plans  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant  nor may options granted under the plans be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
after one year  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
our restricted stock generally vests on a pro rata basis over either three or five years 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is determined at the time of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
a decrease in our forfeiture rate would have increased our stock compensation by approximately  in

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings revenue for the year ended december  remained relatively flat at million  a decrease when compared to the prior year  primarily due to a unit reduction in units closed  mostly offset by a  increase in average closing price 
lower sales volume of  units in as compared to  in  reflects the weakened demand caused by the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit and continuing economic instability 
absorptions in were partially aided by our lower cancellation rate of as compared to in closings exceeded sales in the latter part of the year  resulting in a unit decrease in our backlog in  down to homes as compared to  homes in our active community count dipped slightly from prior year  as did our average sales per community at during  as compared to during west in  home closings grew to units with a value of million  increases of million and units  or and  respectively  over the nevada market experienced continued weakness with a sales unit decrease  more than offsetting our unit gain in california 
the california improvements were aided by a doubling of our active community count in  up to as of year end 
the region had success early in the year  as sales orders and closings increased due in part to the extension of the homebuyer tax credit 
in the latter part of the year  the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit and uncertain economy negatively impacted operations  resulting in sales of units  a decline from the higher closing volume and decrease in sales directly impacted ending backlog of units  down from the prior year 
central the central region s closings of  deliveries totaling million in revenues are and  respectively  lower than those reported in largely impacting the region s results is the slowing of our texas markets  as indicated by the unit or decrease in home closings from the same period a year ago  and due primarily to its decrease in active communities 
offsetting some of the closing declines in texas were increased closings in colorado  while arizona s results remained mostly flat as unit decreases were primarily offset by closing price increases 
the decrease in active communities in texas is a result of scheduled closing of our older communities and redeployment of capital to select markets that present better opportunities to generate higher margins 
this strategy has resulted in the rebalancing of assets from texas into other markets  primarily arizona  california and colorado 
the increased pricing in arizona is due to the in fill communities that have been acquired and opened over the last months 
the region s sales declined units in  resulting in a or unit decrease in ending backlog at december  as compared to prior year 
arizona operations had a decrease in ending backlog to units 
however  the new communities that opened in the latter part of and in are generating higher average sales prices  nearly offsetting the unit decline and resulting in a relatively flat backlog of million  down only  but units from colorado continued to be the only state in the region that did not experience any sales or backlog deterioration from to this is primarily due to an increase in active community count of  which contributed million of additional sales volume and million of additional backlog in versus texas sales reflected the same trends as its revenue  with million and unit declines from the prior year 
east we generated closings with million of home revenue in  a and increase from the same period a year ago 
our east region experienced similar sales improvements generating million of additional sales volume  due to both a increase in unit sales as well as a  increase in average sales price in vs 
we ended with units in backlog with a value of million  and decreases from  and an increased average sales price of  as closings outpaced sales in the final half of the year 
we believe that our community locations have helped the overall performance of this region  as the region s lot supply is primarily comprised of well located lots purchased in the last two years 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings for the year ended december  decreased million or when compared to the prior year  primarily due to the  reduction in units closed with a  lower average closing price 
lower sales volume of  units in as compared to  in  reflected the reduced demand caused by the industry downturn and the economic recession 
absorptions in were partially aided by our lower cancellation rate of as compared to in closings exceeded sales in the latter part of the year due to the initial november homebuyer tax credit deadline and resulted in a decrease of units in our backlog in  down to  homes as compared to  homes in in addition  the decreases in our actively selling communities from at december  to at december  also impacted our sales  closings and backlog levels during however  although we had fewer active communities  we did maintain our average sales per active community at during  in line with in 
table of contents our increased selling efforts and retooled product offerings to attract the first time and first time move up buyer were offset by continuing lower demand as a result of the homebuilding industry downturn 
the economic recession further amplified the pressure on sales prices and the lack of potential homebuyers interest in purchasing a new home during s uncertain times 
additionally  the influx of foreclosures  increases in unemployment rates and the tighter lending standards for obtaining mortgage financing both for our homebuyers as well as for the buyers of their existing homes also dampened demand 
west 
in  home closings decreased to units with a value of million  a or million decrease in home closing revenue as compared to  driven by continued weakness in california and nevada 
the region s decrease in active communities was the primary contributor to the unit decrease in closings as compared to the region s ending backlog of million only decreased when compared to the prior year s million  reflecting our late year successes with our newly opened communities and revised product offerings in california 
central 
the central region s closings of  deliveries generating million of revenues in were and lower than those reported in  respectively 
although texas remained our strongest market during  it had also begun to experience slowing as indicated by its cancellation rate of in  our highest rate experienced in all the states in which we operate 
arizona continued to struggle with an oversupply of existing and foreclosure home inventory contributing to the region s unit decline in home orders in successful marketing campaigns and new replacement subdivisions coming on line in the latter part of kept the arizona backlog reduction to only a unit decline as of december   with average sales prices in the region of  in  consistent with  in east 
we generated closings with million of corresponding home revenue in the decline in deliveries from is attributed to the slowing market in the early part of in mid  we acquired several bargain priced parcels in prime locations in orlando and have had a high level of success in our new communities 
we sold homes in this region  a increase over prior years with a  increase in average sales price 
the increased demand led to higher ending backlog with units for a sales value of million as of december   as compared to units with a sales value of million as of december  our decreases in cancellation rates from for to less than half that rate for  coupled with a steady active community count  demonstrated some of the positive trends that we experienced in select markets

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin improved to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gross margins excluding impairments were and for and  respectively 
our new communities with well priced lots located in good submarkets contributed to the gross margin gains in our margins also benefited from the continued cost cutting measures and building efficiencies we have achieved over the last two years 
our impairment charges reflect the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets 
we recorded only million of impairments in  a million decrease from our impairments in reflect the continuation of soft market conditions in some of our geographies  particularly in our legacy communities in texas as we push to close them out 
we provide gross margins excluding impairments a non gaap term as we use it to evaluate our performance and believe it is a widely accepted financial measure by users of our financial statements in analyzing our operating results and provides comparability to similar calculations by our peers in the homebuilding industry 
west 
our west region improved its home closing gross margin to for from a negative margin of in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the improvement in our pre impairment gross margins is mostly attributable to our desirable locations in our california markets that achieved more normalized margins 
central 
the central region s home closing gross profit increased  basis points as compared to in  primarily due to fewer community impairments recorded in as compared to the same period a year ago and cost savings in materials and construction costs 
during  we were successful in earning near normal margins in many of our new communities in arizona and colorado as the lots were well priced and were located in more desirable submarkets 
the central region s home closing gross margins include million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for excluding these impairments  the gross margin in this region increased to in versus in east 
our east region experienced a significant increase in gross margins earning for versus a negative margin of for the increase in home closing margins is primarily due to reduced impairments recorded  million and million during and  respectively 
gross margins also increased due to the closings generated by our new communities  which tend to earn higher margins and higher average closing prices of  excluding these impairments  gross margins would have been for the region for and for benefitting from our new communities as previously discussed 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin improved to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  margins in benefited from a lower basis for our inventory resulting from prior period impairments 
our impairment charges reflect the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets 
the prolonged downturn in the general economy and homebuilding industry in particular  led to declines in the values of these assets and the abandonment and corresponding write off of certain of our investments 
excluding impairments  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the relatively flat gross margins excluding impairments are primarily the result of declines in average sales prices of home deliveries in  partially offset by cost savings from re negotiated construction contracts and reductions in our asset basis caused by impairments taken in prior periods for homes closed in the current period 
west 
our west region improved its home closing gross loss to a negative margin of for from a negative margin of in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the improvement in our pre impairment gross margins was due to the lower basis in our homes from prior impairments  as well as the benefits realized from the cost reductions noted above  as well as the lower lot basis for new communities 
central 
the central region s home closing gross profit decreased basis points as compared to in  primarily due to the shift of activity to our lower margin texas markets from arizona  which historically had enjoyed higher margins 
despite these decreases  margins in this region remained positive due to the relatively stronger market and lower levels of impairments recorded in texas 
the central region s home closing gross margins included million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for excluding these impairments  the gross margin in this region remained somewhat consistent year over year with margins in versus in the prior year  with the slight decrease mostly due to mix of homes 
east 
this region  like the west  experienced a home closing gross loss  with negative gross margins of for as compared to for the prior year 
the home closing gross losses were primarily due to million and million of real estate related impairments during and gross margins were also impacted by price concessions and product mix  as evidenced by the reduced average closing prices year over year 
excluding these impairments  gross margins would have been for the region for and for

commissions and other sales costs are comprised of internal and external commissions and related sales and marketing expenses such as advertising and sales office costs 
these costs decreased by million for versus the decrease primarily relates to reduced commission expense attributable to lower closing units and revenue dollars as well as reduced sales office and model maintenance costs 
over the past several quarters  we have migrated to a more efficient field marketing structure by reducing the number of models and corresponding operating costs in our model and sales complexes 
in  these savings were partially offset by increased grand opening and marketing costs associated with our extreme green communities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million for versus million in meritage was one of the first homebuilders to aggressively cut overhead and associated general and administrative expenses as the market began its downward cycle in late and therefore  is continuing to operate under this efficient  lean structure  resulting in relatively flat year over year dollar comparisons 
we expect to be able to capitalize on our centralized operations as the economy improves with limited general and administrative expense increases 
general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively  primarily due to the decrease in revenues in interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest incurred  but not capitalized  on our senior and senior subordinated notes  credit facility and other borrowings 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
due to our concentrated efforts to reduce inventory through faster cycle times and to sell under performing assets  the balance of our inventory that is eligible for interest capitalization dropped below the corresponding volume of our debt  resulting in significant amounts of interest expense being charged directly to our statement of operations 
additionally  our new senior notes bear a slightly higher interest rate than the notes that were retired 
interest expense in also includes million related to the amendment of and subsequent termination of our credit facility 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were a benefit of for  compared to for the tax rate reflects the tax benefit we received from federal tax legislation that enabled us to carry back our nol five years 
fiscal compared to fiscal commissions and other sales costs 
as a percentage of home closing revenue  these costs decreased to for from for the decrease primarily related to reduced advertising spending as we focused on targeted national and regional campaigns where we were able to achieve economies of scale while continuing to derive benefit from these efforts at the local level 
we also reduced the size of our model complexes and outfitting homes with fewer options and upgrades to highlight a payment oriented sales approach  demonstrating what a homebuyer can truly afford rather than an options loaded model complex  which reduced our model home costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million for versus although we continued to execute on our cost cutting and streamlining strategy  particularly in headcount and salary expense reductions  the significant revenue decline resulted in our general and administrative expenses increasing as a percentage of home closing revenue 
general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively 
interest expense 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
due to our concentrated efforts to reduce inventory through faster cycle times and to sell under performing assets  the balance of our inventory that was eligible for interest capitalization dropped below the corresponding volume of our debt  resulting in a charge of a significantly larger portion of our interest incurred being expensed directly to our statements of operations 
interest expense in also includes million related to the amendment of and subsequent termination of our credit facility 
similar amendment charges in were million 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were for  compared to for the change in our tax rate during was primarily attributable to the tax benefit from federal tax legislation that enabled us to carry back our nol five years 
the tax rate was lower due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that year 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal uses of capital for were operating expenses  home construction  the payment of routine liabilities and the acquisition of new lot positions 
we used funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions and construction of model homes for finished lot acquisitions 
for raw land purchases  we also need to fund plat and other approvals  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized as an expense in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred 
from a liquidity standpoint  we experienced the positive effects of the homebuilding cash flow cycle during and as our cash balances increased as our community count declined 
as these older communities are closing out and our inventory volumes decrease  we have begun to acquire new lots 
accordingly  on a go forward basis  we expect that cash outlays for land purchases may exceed our cash generated by operations as demand for new homes stabilizes and improves and we actively grow our community count 
during  we purchased about  lots for million  started homes on about  lots and closed  homes 
we exercise strict controls and believe we have a prudent strategy for company wide cash management  particularly as related to cash outlays for land and inventory acquisition development 
we generated million of positive operating cash flows after our lot purchases during at december   we had a cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and securities balance of million at december  as we have no bond maturities until  we intend to generate cash from the sale of our inventory  but we plan to redeploy that cash to acquire well positioned lots that represent opportunities to generate more normal margins and increase our active communities 
in addition  we continue to evaluate our capital needs in light of ongoing developments in homebuilding markets and our existing capital structure 
we believe that we currently have strong liquidity 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital to strengthen our liquidity position  enable us to opportunistically acquire additional land inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions  and or strengthen our long term capital structure 
such additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt financing and may be from a variety of sources 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and increase our interest costs 

table of contents we believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management 
debt to capital and net debt to capital are calculated as follows dollars in thousands at at december  december  notes payable and other borrowings stockholders equity total capital debt to capital notes payable and other borrowings less cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments and securities net debt stockholders equity total net capital net debt to capital debt to capital is computed as notes payable and other borrowing divided by the aggregate of total notes payable and stockholders equity 
net debt to capital is computed as net debt divided by the aggregate of net debt and stockholders equity 
senior and senior subordinated notes senior notes in march  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in april  we repurchased million of our senior notes  resulting in million in aggregate principal remaining on the notes 
the indenture which governs the senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of unconsolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates  and limiting the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the indenture 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed a million private placement of senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued at par  and their associated proceeds were used to pay down our credit facility 
the covenants related to these senior subordinated notes are substantially similar to the covenants of our senior notes discussed in this footnote 
senior notes during the second quarter of  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at of par value to yield 
the indenture for our senior notes contains covenants including  among others  limitations on the amount of secured debt we may incur  and limitations on sale and leaseback transactions of non model home assets and mergers 
the covenants contained in the senior notes are generally no more restrictive  and in many cases less restrictive  than the covenants contained in the indentures for the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 

table of contents senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due in april  we repurchased all of the million of senior notes 
covenant compliance we were in compliance with all senior and senior subordinated note covenants as of december  failure to maintain both the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio does not result in a default under our senior and senior subordinated notes 
rather  it results in a prohibition subject to exceptions from incurring additional indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with our leverage ratio and therefore  the prohibition against incurring additional debt is not applicable 
our actual fixed charge ratio and ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth as of december  are reflected in the table below covenant financial covenant requirement actual in millions fixed charge coverage leverage ratio see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for all further information on our senior and senior subordinated notes 
land under control we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
over the past several years  the slower sales rate caused us to take certain actions  including purchasing lots in advance of corresponding sales  re negotiating the takedown schedules  and discontinuing lot purchases and forfeiting the related non refundable option deposit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the total number of lots under control at december  was  as compared to  at december  in and  respectively  and of our controlled lots were owned 
the increase in our lot position from prior year was due to an intentional effort to grow our lot positions in strategic submarkets during  as we entered into new land contracts for approximately  lots for million as compared to approximately  lots for million in at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes   and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes  million of our senior subordinated notes and million in principal of our senior notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value

our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
