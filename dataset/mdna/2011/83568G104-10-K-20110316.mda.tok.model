item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of sonosite  inc md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our business strategy is to lead in the design  development and commercialization of high performance  innovative ultrasound technology and hand carried ultrasound hcu systems 
we intend to sustain long term growth of our business through technological innovation  broadening of sales distribution channels  entering into and maintaining strategic relationships  expanding into new clinical and geographic markets  and delivering high quality products to customers 
we are focusing on the development of innovative products with the objective of improving patient care and efficiency through ease of use  high performance imaging  and providing quicker results to physicians and clinicians 
we also are investing in research and development in existing and new lines of business and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
we are focused on increasing sales force efficiency and effective cost management 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cardiodynamics international corporation cdic  a leader in impedance cardiography icg for noninvasive hemodynamic assessment that develops  manufactures  and markets icg devices and sensors 
the icg product line provides non invasive assessment of cardiac output and other hemodynamic parameters 
the business combination enables us to expand our distribution platform and product offerings into the primary care setting 
in june we acquired all of the outstanding stock of visualsonics  inc visualsonics a leader in high frequency  high resolution  ultrasound based imaging systems or micro ultrasound systems designed specifically for live imaging of small animals 
live imaging is a useful tool for life sciences research and for the pre clinical stage of the drug development process 
visualsonics technology provides clinicians and research scientists with a simple method for viewing and quantifying extremely small physiological structures and for imaging living tissue with near microscopic resolution 
this business combination positions us for long term growth in both the clinical point of care markets  and the pre clinical markets 
over the last few years  we have laid a foundation for long term growth through expansion in four vertical markets including acute  primary care  musculoskeletal  and field medicine 
we will be introducing innovative products  entering into strategic relationships  expanding into new markets  and providing high quality products with an industry leading year warranty 
in fiscal year  we plan to continue to build on this foundation and to execute well in key areas  including continuing to innovate using existing and new technologies  to build and maintain key relationships in distribution channels  to improve sales productivity  delivering high quality products  and managing the expense structure 
key opportunities include the following product innovation our products provide exceptional reliability  image quality  and ease of use in a lightweight design that can be either hand carried  used on a stand or mounted on a wall or ceiling 
we are committed to continuing to develop our next generation of products and expanding our existing product base by using new and existing technologies 
in we introduced enhanced needle visualization  a significant development in ultrasound imaging that enables improved needle tracking with increased confidence during deep needle procedures 
in fiscal year  we introduced the nanomaxx system  which is based on our fourth generation product platform  and we acquired the bioz product line from cdic 
we will continue to release new and innovative products in 
table of contents sales and marketing our sales and marketing organization will continue to focus on creating greater awareness of the benefits of point of care ultrasound in order to better penetrate established markets  accelerate growth in emerging markets and identify new markets 
over the past two years we have implemented a strategy in our sales channels to better cover key accounts and drive awareness of the safety  cost and efficiency benefits of point of care at the institutional level 
we believe that this will continue to help us more effectively address considerations that are important at the administrative level  and that complement the clinical benefits we have been communicating at the clinician level 
we intend to expand visualsonics geographic market coverage to better address the growth opportunities outside of north america 
additionally  we intend to augment the resources we have to address attractive growth opportunities in emerging economies for our entire business 
strategic relationships and acquisitions we are focused on building relationships and gaining access to products and technologies that will enable us to continue to penetrate and develop point of care visualization 
we believe that new relationships  products  and technologies can accelerate market penetration to customers not served by our direct sales force 
through our acquisition of visualsonics we intend to integrate micro ultrasound technology with our miniaturization competency and user design to deliver ultra high frequency micro ultrasound into clinical medicine 
in we announced an alliance with physio control  inc  the global leader in the development and delivery of emergency medical response solutions  for the development of the point of care visualization market in the emergency medical services segment 
during  we invested in carticept medical inc carticept  a privately held company that develops innovative injection products for the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries 
we believe this relationship will expand our access to the market segment for ultrasound guided injections 
results of operations the overall market environment improved in versus the increase in revenue over the prior year was due to improved execution against our market strategies and partially attributable to the acquisition of visualsonics on june  our financial performance during reflected an increase in revenue  operating income  and cash flows 
we believe our strong and growing product pipeline  alongside our expanding distribution capability  has positioned us well to capitalize on a growing market for point of care ultrasound 
as we enhance our product offerings  integrate the acquisition of visualsonics and develop strategic alliances  we believe opportunities to increase revenue will grow 
the following financial information sets forth our results of operations and is derived from our consolidated financial statements in thousands except percentages year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income total other loss  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income 
table of contents revenue overall revenue increased in compared to due primarily to organic growth in all sales channels  and  revenue of million from visualsonics 
the decrease in compared to was attributable primarily to fewer customer purchases as a result of the global financial crisis combined with uncertainties about healthcare reform in the us changes in exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue in and had a unfavorable impact on revenue in revenue is as follows in thousands except percentages year ended december  percentage change versus versus united states international visualsonics total revenue united states us revenue increased in compared to due primarily to an increase in direct sales  enterprise sales and a full year of revenue from cdic  compared to months in the prior year 
the decrease in compared to was attributable to decreased sales in both hospital and office channels  partially offset by the acquisition of cdic during the third quarter of international international revenue increased in compared to primarily due to increased revenue from asia pacific  most of europe  and latin america 
these increases were offset by countries impacted by the fiscal austerity measures during the last quarter of the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased sales in europe resulting from a slowdown in european hospital capital spending as a result of the global financial crisis 
changes in exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue in and had a unfavorable impact on revenue in fiscal year outlook we are targeting revenue to increase to in compared to we expect to introduce new products and features  to develop the cardiovascular disease market  and to continue international expansion 
we expect revenue growth to increase as new technology introductions from visualsonics arrive in the market and the impact from recent investments in our business channels take effect 
our revenue may be negatively impacted by sustained global economic challenges 
gross margin years ended december  percentage of revenue gross margin gross margin increased in compared to primarily as a result of an improved product mix  geographic mix  and licensed revenues  offset by slightly lower margins of visualsonics 
gross margin in compared to were slightly lower as the favorably impact of product mix and material costs was offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact and the introduction of a new product that had a lower gross margin 

table of contents operating expenses years ended december  percentage of revenue research and development sales  general  and administrative research and development expenditures increased in compared to due to the acquisition of visualsonics as well as continued investment in future technologies that we expect will result in introducing several new products over the next months 
the increase in expenditures in compared to was due to development of future new products and features  and further development related to the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to primarily from to the addition of visualsonics and associated acquisition and integration costs  as well as restructuring costs 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from decreases in legal expenses  stock based compensation and sales compensation expense  offset by the addition of cdic and associated acquisition and integration costs 
other loss  net years ended december  percentage of revenue other loss total other loss increased in compared to due to no gains recognized on the repurchase of our debt  a reduction in interest income due to a decrease in investment balances and increased foreign exchange losses offset by lower interest expense on our debt due to less outstanding debt 
the increase in compared to was due to lower gains recognized on the repurchase of our debt and a reduction in interest income  resulting from lower interest rates  offset by lower interest expense on our debt due to less outstanding debt 
income tax expense years ended december  effective tax rate income tax provision the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates applied to foreign income 
the decrease in our consolidated effective tax rate in  as compared to  results from an increase in the domestic production deduction  the benefit of positive resolution of various uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions  decreases in non deductible executive compensation and other expenses and reduction of the impact of the valuation allowance  offset by an increased federal statutory rate due to growth in taxable income and a decrease for research and experimentation credits 
the decrease in our consolidated effective tax rate in  as compared to  resulted from a reduced federal statutory rate due to a decline in taxable income and an increase for research and experimentation credits  offset by increases in non deductible expenses  an increase to the liability for uncertain tax positions and establishment of a valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforwards 
we assess our ability to realize our tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce our deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards utilized currently as well as the reversing effect of temporary differences 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
we had no short term investment securities as of december   compared to short term and long term investment securities million as of december  investment securities held at the end of and generally consisted of high grade corporate debt

cash flows years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to improved operational performance  offset by a net decrease in working capital and a increase in the deferred income tax provision 
the decrease of cash provided in compared to was primarily attributable to reduced operational performance  offset by a net decrease in working capital offset by an increase in long term deferred revenue primarily as a result of a patent settlement 
investing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million used in and million provided in the increase in cash provided in compared to was due to the net sales and maturities of investment securities offset by the acquisition of visualsonics 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to the acquisition of cdic and net purchases of investment securities 
financing activities used cash of million in  used million in and provided million in more cash was used in financing activities in compared to primarily due to the repurchase of shares compared to the repurchases of convertible notes in more cash was used in financing activities in compared to primarily due to the repurchases of convertible notes slightly offset by an increase in the repayment of long term obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
we are not a party to any derivative transactions except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below and the call option and warrant instruments indexed to our common stock 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our 
table of contents subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees require only disclosure 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations includes interest of on convertible senior notes and interest of and on bank loans assumed in the acquisition of cdic represents minimum purchase consideration for the acquisition of lumenvu 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  we have million of unrecognized tax benefits reflected as either liabilities or as a reduction of deferred tax assets  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be incurred 
other commitments in we entered into a joint distribution agreement with carticept  which requires us to procure a minimum number of carticept products in that will be determined based on distribution activity in in june  we committed to donating of our systems and two probes per system per year over a four year period to a research university commencing in for use in clinical research 
as of december   we anticipate shipping the first systems in early as part of our supplier agreements  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our products in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
in certain countries  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare gpos 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales  general  and administrative expenses of million in  million in and million in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  business combinations  valuation of inventories  warranty expense  income taxes  stock based compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets and convertible debt and hedge transaction 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  trade in allowances  and estimated returns 
we estimate returns by reviewing our historical returns  considering customer reaction to new product introductions and current economic conditions 
we separately price and sell product upgrades to our customers 
we recognize licensing revenue using the proportional performance method  a ratable recognition approach over the life of the license 
in addition to a standard warranty  we offer extended warranty and service contracts for coverage beyond the standard warranty period or coverage above what is covered by a standard warranty 
those service contracts are recorded as deferred revenue 
for extended warranty and service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our standard product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty liability 
our standard distributor arrangements do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
for the vast majority of our shipments  all deliverables are shipped together 
however  in cases some elements of a multiple element arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and include some software elements 
effective january   we adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance  which removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance if the products contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
it also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
concurrently  we adopted guidance that provides principles and application direction on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
it also requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price 
the guidance eliminates the use of the residual method  requires entities to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 

table of contents when the undelivered element represents services under extended service contracts  revenue equal to the stated price is deferred and recognized evenly over the contract term as those services are provided 
adoption of these pronouncements did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
business combination 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of visualsonics 
the purchase method of accounting was used to account for this acquisition 
the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given  equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date 
the cost of acquisition for visualsonics was more than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired  the excess of the value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price has been recorded as goodwill 
we recorded identifiable assets including customer relationships  developed technology  trademarks  and internally developed software  which have lives from two to twenty five years 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cdic and medis medizinische messtechnik gmbh medis 
the purchase method of accounting was used to account for this acquisition 
the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given  equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date 
because the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired  the excess of the value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price has been recorded as a bargain purchase gain 
we recorded identifiable assets including customer relationships  developed technology  trademarks  and internally developed software  which have lives from two to six years 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs to their net realizable values are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical and anticipated product failure rates and service repair costs using management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the nanomaxx  m turbo  s series  micromaxx  and bioz systems 
given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for these systems is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the nanomaxx system  m turbo system  and s series ultrasound tools compared with our micromaxx system and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of the micromaxx and the other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for these products 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase due to the five year warranty offered with these products 
should actual failure rates or repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of 
table of contents items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge  if any  from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate 
we have accumulated foreign nol carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
during  with the acquisition of visualsonics  we acquired various foreign tax attribute carryforwards including research and experimentation expenditure pool  net operating loss  and research and experimentation taxes 
additionally  during  with the acquisition of cdic we acquired us federal and state nol carryforwards 
we assess our ability to utilize these foreign attribute carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
based upon a review of historical operating performance  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized with the exception of million related to capital loss carryforward  million related to cdic state nol carryforward  and million related to visualsonics net deferred tax asset 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
for stock options  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  and risk free rate 
we estimate volatility by considering our historical stock volatility 
we estimate the expected life and expected term based on historical trends 
the risk free rate is estimated using comparable published federal funds rates 
further  we estimate future forfeitures for both stock options and rsus granted  which are not expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures using historical forfeiture trends and employee turnover rates as well as our judgment of future forfeitures 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on  or determined from  external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
in addition  future grants of equity awards will result in additional compensation expense in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate reporting unit 
table of contents carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values 
intangible assets subject to amortization  which consist mainly of customer relationships  acquired technology  trademarks  and non compete agreements  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to twenty five years 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis  including the identification of our reporting units  identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units and determination of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analyses  we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that represent the highest and best use for our reporting units 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in further goodwill impairment charges 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this analysis requires similar significant judgments as those discussed above regarding goodwill  except for cash flows are based on an undiscounted cash flow to determine the fair value of the intangible 
convertible debt and hedge transaction 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance  which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
we bifurcated a component of the conversion option and classified that component in equity 
the value of the equity component was calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component  using the discount rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature  as of the issuance date 
the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as the liability component was recorded as the equity component 
we recognize the accretion of the resulting discount as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
upon settlement of our convertible senior notes  we revalue the liability component  utilizing an interest rate of comparable nonconvertible debt 
we allocate a portion of the consideration transferred to the liability component equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to repurchase 
any difference between the consideration attributed to the liability component and the sum of the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance costs is recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of income 
any remaining consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and is recognized as a reduction of stockholders equity 
our interest expense is composed of two parts the stated rate of the debt and the amortization of the debt discount 
additionally  we have recorded the call option and warrant transactions as equity instruments 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
a 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test under asc topic for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts to require an entity to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are adverse qualitative factors  including the examples provided in asc paragraph  in determining whether an interim goodwill impairment test between annual test dates is necessary 
the asu allows an entity to use either the equity or enterprise valuation premise to determine the carrying amount of a reporting unit 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  for a nonpublic company 
the company expects that the adoption of asu in will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of million of interest bearing money market accounts 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk because of our international presence  we are exposed to foreign currency risk on intercompany balances  from trade and intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than us dollar usd and from translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results 
we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the impact of fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
these foreign currencies include the australian dollar  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the european union euro  and the japanese yen 
we use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions 
currently our foreign exchange contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
we seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with engaging in foreign currency contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts  totaling million in notional amount  indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by approximately million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by approximately million 
the offsetting gains and losses resulting from the changes in the intercompany balances as described above are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above
