item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions improved during as customer demand continued to recover from the sharp decline in late and early as a result  sales volumes increased across our business 
customer demand was particularly strong within our electronic materials segment where demand for our products resulted in significantly higher sales volume  especially for conductive pastes used to produce solar cells 
net sales increased by compared with sales increased in all reporting segments during the year with the highest growth rates in electronic materials  polymer additives and color and glass performance materials 
higher precious metal costs  which are passed through to customers  contributed to the sales growth in electronic materials 
manufacturing rationalization activities and other cost reduction actions continued during  resulting in a number of plant closures and reduced worldwide employment 
the major operational activities related to the restructuring programs that were initiated in were completed during the planned plant closings and associated transfer of manufacturing assets between locations have largely been completed  although we expect some activities to continue in related to product production transfers  customer product re qualifications and site cleanup 
the restructuring activities completed in and prior years contributed to higher gross margins and income from continuing operations during 
table of contents gross profit increased in compared with  driven by higher sales  improved product mix and improved manufacturing efficiency 
gross margin percentage increased compared to and was higher than was recorded prior to the global recession in and for the year  raw material cost increases were offset by product price increases  in aggregate  so the cost increases had little effect on gross profit 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased during drivers of the increased sg a expenses included higher incentive compensation accruals and the resumption of normal wage adjustments 
in addition  higher special charges  primarily related to manufacturing rationalization projects  contributed to the higher sg a expenses during the year 
restructuring and impairment charges were higher in compared with the majority of the charges related to our manufacturing rationalization activities in europe  which resulted in ending manufacturing activities at selected sites in france  the united kingdom  portugal and the netherlands 
interest expense declined in  primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels 
interest expense also declined as a result of debt refinancing actions taken during the year which reduced amortization expenses that are included in interest expense 
we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt in that resulted primarily from our purchase of a portion of the company s outstanding convertible senior notes in connection with our refinancing actions 
we recorded income from continuing operations during compared with a loss in the increased income was the result of higher gross profit and lower interest expense 
these benefits were partially offset by higher restructuring and impairment charges  losses on extinguishment of debt  increased sg a expenses  and higher income tax expense 
outlook we expect demand for our products to improve during compared with the growth rate of sales is likely to be less in than in  as growth in was enhanced by a rebound in customer demand after the global economic downturn 
raw material input costs have increased in the past several quarters as global economic activity has increased  and these costs are expected to continue to rise 
we will attempt to raise product prices to maintain our gross margin percentage  but our ability to do so will be dependent on market conditions and our competitors pricing actions 
during  we ended production of several products  including certain metal oxides  commodity dielectric materials and precious metal preparations  as a result of restructuring activities and business transactions with third parties 
we have been engaged in significant manufacturing rationalization activities and expense reduction projects for several years 
the major operational changes related to these projects have been largely completed  but we expect some continuing restructuring related activities during  including product production transfers  product re qualifications and site clean up 
as a result  we expect to incur restructuring charges at a significantly reduced level in as we complete the final tasks related to these projects 
factors that could adversely affect our future financial performance are described under the heading risk factors in item a

we are subject to a number of covenants under our credit facility 
the covenants include requirements for a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than to and a leverage ratio less than to on the last day of any fiscal quarter and calculated using the last four fiscal quarters 
in the fixed charge ratio  the numerator consists 
table of contents of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  and special charges  less capital expenditures  and the denominator is the sum of interest expense paid in cash  scheduled principal payments  and restricted payments consisting of dividends and any stock buy backs 
in the leverage ratio  the numerator is total debt  which consists of borrowing and letters of credit outstanding on the credit facility and our international facilities  the principal amount outstanding on our senior notes and convertible notes  capital lease obligations  and amounts outstanding on our us and international receivables sales programs  and the denominator is the sum of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  and special charges 
our ability to meet these covenants is primarily driven by our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  our total debt  and our interest payments 
our total debt is primarily driven by cash flow items  including net income before amortization  depreciation  and other noncash charges  our capital expenditures  requirements for deposits from participants in our precious metals consignment program  our customers ability to make payments for purchases and the timing of such payments  and our ability to manage inventory and other working capital items 
our interest payments are driven by our debt level  external fees  and interest rates  primarily the prime rate and libor

our ability to pay common stock dividends is limited by certain covenants in our credit facility and the bond indenture governing the senior notes 
the covenant in our credit facility is the more limiting of the two covenants and limits our ability to make restricted payments  which include  but are not limited to  common stock dividends and the repurchase of equity interests 
we are not permitted to make restricted payments in excess of million dollars in any calendar year 
however  if we make less than million of restricted payments in any calendar year  the unused amount can be carried over for restricted payments in future years  provided that the maximum amount of restricted payments in any calendar year cannot exceed million

at december   ferro s consolidated balance sheet included outstanding trade accounts receivable legally transferred to ffc of million 
while there were no advances by purchasers for interests in those receivables at december   the average advances during were million 
the need for advances under the asset securitization program varies throughout the year as liquidity needs change 
after reductions for non qualifying receivables  we had million of additional borrowings available under the program at december  off balance sheet arrangements international receivable sales programs 
we maintain several international programs to sell trade accounts receivable 
at december   the commitments supporting these programs  which can be withdrawn at any time  totaled million  the amount of outstanding receivables sold under these programs was million  and ferro had received net proceeds under these programs of million for outstanding receivables 
based on available and qualifying receivables  there was no additional availability under these programs at december  
table of contents consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
we use precious metals  primarily silver  in the production of some of our products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements generally referred to as our precious metals consignment program 
the financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign 
these fees were million for at december   we had on hand million of precious metals  measured at fair value  owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program 
we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
the consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short term commitments that typically mature within to days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis 
as a result  the company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity 
beginning in  several participants in our precious metals consignment program renewed their requirement for us to deliver cash collateral to secure our obligations arising under the consignment agreements 
at december   ferro had delivered million in cash collateral to induce those financial institutions to participate in ferro s precious metals consignment program at the amounts requested 
we may be required to furnish additional cash collateral in the future based on our financial partners requirements or our amounts of consigned precious metals 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs  foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangements we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  we had million of additional borrowings available under these lines at december  liquidity requirements our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  labor costs  working capital requirements  restructuring expenditures  capital investments  precious metals cash collateral requirements  and postretirement obligations 
we expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements 
cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs 
in  cash flows from operating activities were sufficient to fund our investing activities  primarily capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
we had additional borrowing capacity of million at december   and million at december   available under various credit facilities  primarily our revolving credit facility 
we have taken a variety of actions to enhance liquidity  including restructuring activities and suspension of dividend payments on our common stock 
our level of debt  debt service requirements  and ability to access credit markets could have important consequences to our business operations and uses of cash flows 
uncertainties in the global capital markets have not prohibited us from accessing the capital markets 
in  we extended our asset securitization facility  issued senior notes  which mature in  and entered into the credit facility  which matures in we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market 
table of contents conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
difficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit  receivable sales programs  forward contracts  and precious metal program 
these counterparties are major  reputable  multinational institutions  all having investment grade credit ratings  except for one  which is not rated 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counterparty default 
however  an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition 
we assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses  as well as our financial and capital structure  to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives 
as part of this process  from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and  where appropriate  pursue the sale of such businesses 
we also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position 
generally  we publicly announce divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into definitive agreements relating to those transactions 
the company s aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands loans payable long term debt interest operating lease obligations purchase commitments taxes retirement and other postemployment benefits   long term debt excludes unamortized discounts on the convertible notes and imputed interest and executory costs on capitalized lease obligations 
interest represents only contractual payments for fixed rate debt 
purchased commitments are non cancelable contractual obligations for raw materials and energy 
we have not projected payments past due to uncertainties in estimating the amount and period of any payments 
the funding amounts are based on the minimum contributions required under our various plans and applicable regulations in each respective country plus a planned one time payment of million in to improve the funding of a non us pension plan 
we have not projected contributions past due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report revenues gross along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions we enter into and take title and the risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory we process  although the timing of when we take title to the inventory during the production process may vary 
restructuring and cost reduction programs between and  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america  europe and asia pacific 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives  as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made or actions are completed 
restructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyze the carrying value of long lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  such as a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
goodwill while goodwill recorded on our balance sheet is no longer amortized  we review it for impairment each year using a measurement date of october st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate a more representative fair value 
the income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting unit over its useful life and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting 
table of contents unit in the process 
we use historical results and trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of similar businesses  including offers from potential acquirers 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
the significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analysis of goodwill were as follows significant assumptions weighted average cost of capital residual growth rate our estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our business units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in previous levels of capital spending could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the value of one or more of our business units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
we had three reporting units with goodwill balances as of our most recent measurement date 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from to at the measurement date 
there were no known material uncertainties that would have led to an indicator of impairment for while no impairment was indicated as a result of our annual test for any reporting unit that had a goodwill balance  a future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results should differ materially from forecasted results 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and as a result not support the carrying values of our assets are new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process reducing operating margins  new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment  and substantial downturns in economic conditions such as those experienced in late and for most of income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation  and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate taxable income where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our 
table of contents ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 
we have significant operations outside the us many of these non us tax jurisdictions have statutory income tax rates that are lower than the rates in the us because we carry a majority of our debt in the us  we also have significant cash needs in the us to service this debt 
as a result  it is necessary for us to perform significant tax and treasury planning and analysis to determine the best actions to achieve the goals of meeting our us cash needs  while also reducing our worldwide taxable income 
in this tax and treasury planning  we consider future taxable income in the us and non us jurisdictions  future cash needs in the non us  and the timing and amount of dividend repatriations 
our ability to balance future taxable income and cash flows between the us and foreign locations depends on various strategies  such as the charging of management fees for intercompany services  transfer pricing  intercompany royalties  intercompany sales of technologies and intellectual property  and choosing between allowable tax methods 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more likely than not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex  and observable market based inputs are available to measure their fair value 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major  reputable  multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
except as noted below  we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we had entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
in the third quarter of  in conjunction with repayment of our remaining outstanding term loans  we settled these swaps 

table of contents we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials products 
we also use precious metals in our color and glass performance materials products 
when we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer s request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content 
our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
we also purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s investor services  inc or standard poor s rating group  but exclude certain bonds  such as callable bonds  bonds with small amounts outstanding  and bonds with unusually high or low yields 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
for the market related value of plan assets  we use fair value  rather than a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions 
our target asset allocation percentages are fixed income and equity investments for us plans and fixed income  equity  and other investments for non us plans 
in  investment returns on average plan assets were approximately within us plans and within us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 

table of contents all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease in basis point decrease in discount rate asset return assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased million to million in from million in in  amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses decreased by million  primarily because the beginning of the year unrecognized net actuarial losses decreased by million from the prior year 
these unrecognized losses arise from differences between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognized in future periods 
in addition  our expected return on plan asset increased by million due to higher asset balances largely resulting from market gains in  the interest component of net periodic benefit cost decreased million primarily due to lower discount rates  and service costs decreased million as a result of various restructuring activities 
these favorable effects were mostly offset by an increase of million in net settlement and curtailment losses  led by a settlement loss of million related to establishing a fully insured arrangement for benefit obligations at rotterdam  netherlands 
for  we expect our overall net periodic benefit cost to decrease to approximately million  a decrease of million 
in  we recorded million of one time net curtailment and settlement losses 
in addition  these curtailments and settlements were the primary drivers of a million decrease during in our non us plans benefit obligation 
this decrease in the benefit obligation will reduce interest cost in our non us plans by million 

table of contents inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
our objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we had entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
in august  in conjunction with repayment of our remaining outstanding term loans  we settled these swaps 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we enter into forward purchase arrangements with precious metals suppliers to completely cover the value of the 
table of contents precious metals content of fixed price sales contracts
