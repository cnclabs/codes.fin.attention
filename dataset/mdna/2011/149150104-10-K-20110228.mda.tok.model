chllc and chllc do not own property at december  competition we face substantial competition for deposits  loans and other banking services  as well as acquisitions  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
these banks and financial institutions have greater resources than we do  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand and make acquisitions 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  they have substantially greater lending limits than we do and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies have increased the level of competition among financial services companies and may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
in addition  current federal legislation encourages increased competition between different types of financial institutions and has encouraged new entrants to enter the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which will have the effect of  among other things  i eliminating historical barriers that limited participation by certain institutions in certain markets  ii increasing the cost of doing business for banks  and or iii affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors are also expected to increase competitive conditions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking in certain locations  internet banking  an internet website www

this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund  and secondarily for the stability of the us banking system 
it is not intended for the benefit of stockholders of financial institutions 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion 
from time to time  federal and state legislation is enacted which may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
in response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability in recent years  legislative and regulatory initiatives have been  and will likely continue to be  introduced and implemented  which could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry 
we cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or new regulations will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
such developments may further alter the structure  regulation  and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject us to increased regulation  disclosure  and reporting requirements 
moreover  bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in the current economic environment in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and this has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement actions to financial institutions requiring action to address credit quality  liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy  as well as other safety and soundness concerns 
recent developments the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the landmark dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act financial reform legislation the dodd frank act  which was enacted on july   significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement authority of federal bank regulators 
many of the regulations that have been promulgated and are to be promulgated under the dodd frank act will impact our operations and costs 
the dodd frank act followed other legislative and regulatory initiatives in and in response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability 
the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial industry and  in many cases  will impact larger and smaller financial institutions and community banks differently over time 
it includes the following the creation of a financial services oversight counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation  
table of contents expanded fdic authority to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain systemically significant non bank financial companies in addition to depository institutions  the establishment of strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for banks and bank holding companies  including minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements no less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  the requirement by statute that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries  enhanced regulation of financial markets  including the derivative and securitization markets  and the elimination of certain proprietary trading activities by banks  the termination of investments by the us treasury under troubled asset relief program tarp  the elimination and phase out of trust preferred securities from tier capital with certain exceptions  a permanent increase of the previously implemented temporary increase of fdic deposit insurance to  and an extension of federal deposit coverage until january   for the full net amount held by depositors in non interesting bearing transaction accounts  authorization for financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts  changes in the calculation of fdic deposit insurance assessments  such that the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but instead  will be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity  the elimination of remaining barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks  expanded restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under section a and b of the federal reserve act and lending limits for derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions  the transfer of oversight of federally chartered thrift institutions to the office of the comptroller of the currency and the elimination of the office of thrift supervision  provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at most united states publicly traded companies  including i stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation  ii executive compensation clawback requirements for companies listed on national securities exchanges in the event of materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iii enhanced independence requirements for compensation committee members  and iv giving the sec authority to adopt proxy access rules which would permit stockholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as director and have those nominees included in a company s proxy statement  and the creation of a bureau of consumer financial protection  which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to bank and non bank financial products 
we cannot predict the extent to which the interpretations and implementation of this wide ranging federal legislation by regulations and in supervisory policies and practices may affect us 
many of the requirements of the dodd frank act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years 
there can be no assurance that these or future reforms arising out of studies and reports required by the dodd frank act will not significantly increase our compliance or other operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the dodd frank act will likely result in more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage requirements on us or otherwise adversely affect our business 
as a result of the changes required by the dodd frank act  the profitability of our business activities may be impacted and we may be required to make changes to certain of our business practices 
these changes may also require us to devote significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 

table of contents eesa and arra through its authority under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  as amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  the us treasury treasury implemented the tarp capital purchase program the tarp cpp  which was designed to bolster eligible healthy institutions by injecting capital into these institutions 
we participated in the tarp cpp so that we could continue to lend and support our current and prospective clients 
under the terms of our participation  we received million in exchange for the issuance of preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock and thereby became subject to various requirements  including certain restrictions on paying dividends on our common stock and repurchasing our equity securities  unless the treasury has consented 
in order to participate in the tarp cpp  financial institutions were required to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
these standards generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include i ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  ii requiring clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains  or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  iii a prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and iv agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
arra included a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
arra imposes certain new  more stringent executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the us treasury is repaid 
the executive compensation standards under arra include  but are not limited to  i prohibitions on bonuses  retention awards and other incentive compensation  other than restricted stock grants which do not fully vest during the tarp ccp period up to one third of an employee s total annual compensation  ii prohibitions on golden parachute payments for departure from a company  iii an expanded clawback of bonuses  retention awards  and incentive compensation if payment is based on materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iv prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  v retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards  and other compensation previously provided by tarp ccp recipients if found by the us treasury to be inconsistent with the purposes of tarp ccp or otherwise contrary to the public interest  vi establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  and vii inclusion in a participant s proxy statements for annual stockholder meetings of a non binding say on pay stockholder vote on the compensation of executives 
we have complied with the compensation provisions of tarp cpp and arra and have certified as to such compliance in the exhibits attached to this report pursuant to section b of the eesa 
we do not plan to repay the million tarp ccp funds in the immediate future 
international capital and liquidity initiatives the international basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries 
the basel committee develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
in december  the basel committee released two consultative documents proposing significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements in response to the economic downturn to enhance the basel ii framework which had not yet been fully implemented internationally and even less so in the united states 
the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors commonly referred to as the g  including the united states  endorsed the reform package  referred to as basel iii  and proposed phase in 
table of contents timelines in november basel iii provides for increases in the minimum tier common equity ratio and the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio 
basel iii additionally includes a capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum requirement designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress  and an additional required countercyclical buffer percentage to be implemented according to a particular nation s circumstances 
these capital requirements are further supplemented under basel iii by a non risk based leverage ratio 
basel iii also reaffirms the basel committee s intention to introduce higher capital requirements on securitization and trading activities at the end of bank holding company regulation the bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act bhca and is registered as such with the federal reserve board federal reserve 
it is also subject to supervision and examination by the federal reserve and its authority to require periodic reports and such additional information as the federal reserve may require  require bank holding companies to maintain increased levels of capital see capital adequacy requirements below  require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank  restrict the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks  terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries  affiliates or investments if the federal reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of any bank subsidiary  require the prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes  regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations  and approve acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive  management  financial  or other factors in granting these approvals in addition to similar california or other state banking agency approvals which may be required 
the federal reserve s view is that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the federal reserve regulations  or both 
the source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels 
in such a situation  the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank s federal regulator to take prompt corrective action 
see prompt corrective action provisions below 
restrictions on activities subject to prior notice or federal reserve approval  bank holding companies may generally engage in  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto

on march   the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic pursuant to which the bank is required to develop and implement  within specified time periods  plans satisfactory to the dfi and the fdic to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to enhance and to improve the quality of the stress testing of the bank s loan portfolio  and to revise the bank s loan policy in connection therewith  to develop and adopt a strategic plan addressing improved profitability and capital ratios and to reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to develop and adopt a capital plan  to develop and implement a plan to improve asset quality  including the methodology for calculating the loss reserve allocation and evaluating its adequacy  and to develop and implement a plan to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
in addition  the bank is required to report progress to the dfi and fdic on a quarterly basis 
the bank is also subject to a restriction on dividends from the bank to the bancorp and is required to maintain adequate allowance for loan and lease losses and is subject to restrictions on any new branches and business lines without prior approval 
the bank is required to notify the fdic and the dfi prior to effecting certain changes to our senior executive officers and board of directors  is limited and or prohibited  in certain circumstances  in its ability to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute severance and indemnification payments  and is required to retain management and directors acceptable to the dfi and the fdic 
the bank s board established a compliance committee to review the company s management and governance and make recommendations to the board 
there can be no assurance that either bancorp or bank will not become subject to further supervisory action or regulatory proceedings 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits through the deposit insurance fund the dif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased to  and all non interest bearing transaction accounts are insured through december  the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
due to the greatly increased rate of bank failures experienced in the current period of financial stress  as well as the extraordinary programs in which the fdic has been involved to support the banking industry generally  the dif was substantially depleted and the fdic has incurred substantially increased operating costs 
on november   the fdic adopted a requirement for institutions to prepay in their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of   and 
table of contents the dodd frank act also changes the base for fdic insurance assessments to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than upon its deposit base alone  and requires the fdic to increase the dif s reserves against future losses 
this will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than billion 
as required by the dodd frank act  on october   the fdic further addressed plans to bolster the dif by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to ratio of reserves to insured deposits by september  current assessment rates will remain in effect until such time as the industry s reserve ratio reaches  which the fdic estimates will occur at the end of the fdic also proposed to raise its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the fdic otherwise determines  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels 
these announced increases and any future increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material and adverse affect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of  or market for  our common stock 
all fdic insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fico assessment rates  which are determined quarterly  were of insured deposits for the first quarter of fiscal and of insured deposits for each of the last three quarters of fiscal the fdic may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the dif or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank s charter by the dfi 
capital adequacy requirements bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
increased capital requirements are expected as a result of expanded authority set forth in the dodd frank act and international supervisory developments 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting  and other factors 
at december   the company s and the bank s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the federal banking agencies for well capitalized institutions 
see capital resources capital adequacy in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  such as loans  and those recorded as off balance sheet items  such as commitments  letters of credit  and recourse arrangements 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk based capital standards 

table of contents qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital tier i capital currently includes common equity and trust preferred securities  subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits 
the capital received from the series b preferred stock offering also qualifies as tier i capital 
under the dodd frank act  depository institution holding companies with more than billion in total consolidated assets as of december   will no longer be able to include trust preferred securities as tier regulatory capital as of the end of a phase out period in  and will be obligated to replace any outstanding trust preferred securities issued prior to may   with qualifying tier regulatory capital during the phase out period 
tier ii capital includes hybrid capital instruments  other qualifying debt instruments  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
following the phase out period under the dodd frank act  trust preferred securities will be treated as tier ii capital 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
under the capital guidelines  there are three fundamental capital ratios a total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio  and a tier leverage ratio 
to be deemed well capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least ten percent  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least at six percent  and a tier leverage ratio of at least five percent 
there is currently no tier leverage requirement for a holding company to be deemed well capitalized 
at december   the respective capital ratios of the bancorp and the bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed well capitalized 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
the federal banking agencies may change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized  in which case institutions may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits 
the bancorp and the bank are also required to maintain a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans 
federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both ratios exceeding regulatory minimums 
basel accords the current risk based capital guidelines which apply to the company and the bank are based upon the capital accord referred to as basel i of the basel committee 
the basel committee develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new framework and accord  referred to as basel ii evolved from to out of the efforts to revise capital adequacy standards for internationally active banks 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  and supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements and became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the united states in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii was 
table of contents optional for others  and if adopted  must first be complied with in a parallel run for two years along with the existing basel i standards 
the united states federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule for banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches under basel ii 
while this proposed rule generally parallels the relevant approaches under basel ii  it diverges where united states markets have unique characteristics and risk profiles 
a definitive final rule has not yet been issued 
the united states banking agencies indicated  however  that they would retain the minimum leverage requirement for all united states banks 
in january  the basel committee proposed to reconsider regulatory capital standards  supervisory and risk management requirements and additional disclosures to further strengthen the basel ii framework in response to the worldwide economic downturn 
in december  the basel committee released two consultative documents proposing significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements to enhance the basel ii framework which had not yet been fully implemented internationally and even less so in the united states 
the g endorsed the reform package  referred to as basel iii  and proposed phase in timelines in november basel iii provides for increases in the minimum tier common equity ratio and the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio 
basel iii additionally includes a capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum requirement designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress  and an additional required countercyclical buffer percentage to be implemented according to a particular nation s circumstances 
these capital requirements are further supplemented under basel iii by a non risk based leverage ratio 
basel iii also reaffirms the basel committee s intention to introduce higher capital requirements on securitization and trading activities at the end of the basel iii liquidity proposals have three main elements i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors 
implementation of basel iii in the united states will require regulations and guidelines by united states banking regulators  which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
it is unclear how united states banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of basel iii and to what extent and when smaller banking organizations in the united states will be subject to these regulations and guidelines 
basel iii standards  if adopted  would lead to significantly higher capital requirements  higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios 
the standards would impose more restrictive eligibility requirements for tier and tier capital  increase the minimum tier common equity ratio to  net of regulatory deductions  and introduce a capital conservation buffer of an additional of common equity to risk weighted assets  raising the target minimum common equity ratio to  increase the minimum tier capital ratio to inclusive of the capital conservation buffer  increase the minimum total capital ratio to inclusive of the capital conservation buffer  and introduce a countercyclical capital buffer of up to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital for periods of excess credit growth 
basel iii also introduces a non risk adjusted tier leverage ratio of  based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets  and new liquidity standards 
the new basel iii capital standards will be phased in from january  until january  
table of contents united states banking regulators must also implement basel iii in conjunction with the provisions of the dodd frank act related to increased capital and liquidity requirements 
further  the dodd frank act requires minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for all depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions that cannot be less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  july  prompt corrective action provisions the fdi act provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates  including parent holding companies  by their federal banking regulators 
it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards  including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan 
supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institution s classification within five capital categories as defined in the regulations 
the relevant capital measures are the capital ratio  the tier capital ratio  and the leverage ratio 
however  the federal banking agencies have also adopted non capital safety and soundness standards to assist examiners in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these include operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset quality and growth  v earnings  vi risk management  and vii compensation and benefits 
a depository institution s capital tier under the prompt corrective action regulations will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and the other factors established by the regulations 
a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  and v critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to  or deemed to be in  a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
the fdi act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the regulatory agencies may not accept such a plan without determining that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan 
the bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance 
the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately 
table of contents capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the appropriate federal banking agency may  under certain circumstances  reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized 
the fdi act provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 
the appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution 
dividends holders of the bancorp s common stock and preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or in case there is no surplus  out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
our recently adopted capital management and dividend policy as part of our three year capital and strategic plan includes a policy to refrain from paying dividends in excess of 
per share per quarter  except when covered by operating earnings beginning in the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by our board of directors in accordance with the capital management and dividend policy 
it is the federal reserve s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
it is also the federal reserve s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
additionally  in consideration of the current financial and economic environment  the federal reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
the bancorp is further currently restricted as to the payment of dividends by the memorandum of understanding with the frb sf 
as a result of losses incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of  we were expected to inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring or paying any dividends and we have agreed under the memorandum of understanding with the frb sf that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
on february   bancorp received federal reserve approval to make payments on our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated securities 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments or dividends in the future 
the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
subject to the regulatory restrictions which currently further restrict the ability of the bank to declare and pay dividends  future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 

table of contents the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to the bancorp is subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the dfi in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the bancorp is currently a participant under the tarp cpp 
under the terms of the tarp cpp  for so long as any preferred stock issued under the tarp cpp remains outstanding  the bancorp is prohibited from increasing dividends on its common stock  and from making certain repurchases of equity securities  including its common stock  without the treasury s consent until the third anniversary of the treasury s investment or until the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the tarp cpp to third parties 
as long as the preferred stock issued to the treasury is outstanding  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities  including the bancorp s common stock  are also prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
see capital resources and liquidity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
the terms of our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated securities also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
if we are not current in our payment of dividends on our series b preferred stock or in our payment of interest on our junior subordinated securities  we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
see risk factors the terms of our outstanding preferred stock limit our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock and there can be no assurance of any future dividends on our common stock generally and risk factors our outstanding debt securities restrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock in part item a of this annual report on form k 
the bank is subject to a restriction on dividends it may pay to the bancorp under its memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic 
under the memorandum of understanding the bancorp entered into with the frb sf  we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
in our three year capital and strategic plan  we indicate the bank will not pay a dividend to us in operations and consumer compliance laws the bank must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations  including the usa patriot act of  the bank secrecy act  the cra  the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  the equal credit opportunity act  the truth in lending act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the national flood insurance act and various federal and state privacy protection laws 
the bank and the company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition 
these laws and regulations also mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to lawsuits and penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the dodd frank act provides for the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection as an independent entity within the federal reserve 
this bureau is a new regulatory agency for united states banks 
it will have broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards  and the dodd frank act contains provisions on mortgage related matters such as steering incentives  determinations as to a 
table of contents borrower s ability to repay and prepayment penalties 
the bureau s functions include investigating consumer complaints  conducting market research  rulemaking  supervising and examining banks consumer transactions  and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services 
it is anticipated that the bureau will begin regulating activities in for banks  such as the bank  with over billions in assets 
banks with less than billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
each member of the fhlb of san francisco is required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of i a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or ii an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
there can be no assurance that the fhlb will pay dividends at the same rate it has paid in the past  or that it will pay any dividends in the future 
impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
environmental regulation in the course of the bank s business  the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clear up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site  the bank may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages  and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the bank ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
audit requirements the bank is required to have an annual independent audit  alone or as a part of its bank holding company s audit  and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the bank and the bancorp are also each required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors 
as required by nasdaq  the bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors  independence  and qualification standards 
as such  among other requirements  the bancorp must maintain an audit committee that includes members with banking 
table of contents or related financial management expertise  has access to its own outside counsel  and does not include members who are large customers of the bank 
in addition  because the bank has more than billion in total assets  it is subject to the fdic requirements for audit committees of large institutions 
the sarbanes oxley act also addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters 
management and the bancorp s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of december  these assessments are included in controls and procedures in part ii item a of this annual report on form k

risk factors 
difficult business and economic conditions have adversely affected our industry 
our financial performance generally  and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the united states as a whole 
in december  the united states entered into a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been greatly reduced and unemployment has increased significantly 
dramatic declines in the real estate market  with decreasing prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
although the economy has showed some signs of improvement  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak  and unemployment remains high in general and in the markets in which we operate 
local governments and many businesses are still experiencing serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and liquidity in the credit markets 
these economic pressures on consumers and businesses may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we potentially face increased regulation of our industry  including changes by congress or federal regulatory agencies to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime and heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements or expectations imposed in connection with the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or the dodd frank act  the emergency economic stabilization act of  or the eesa  and the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the arra  or other legislation that may be adopted in the future 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  new jersey  and hong kong 
adverse economic conditions in these regions in particular could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these conditions include the effects of the current general decline in real estate sales and prices in many markets across the united states  the economic recession of recent years  and higher rates of unemployment 
these conditions 
table of contents could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us  if at all  and could also cause a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  any of which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
we are subject to a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  or the frb sf  and the bank is subject to a memorandum of understanding with the california dfi and the fdic and we may be subject to further supervisory action by bank supervisory authorities that could have a material negative effect on our business  financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  the dfi and the federal reserve board  and separately the fdic as insurer of the bank s deposits  have authority to compel or restrict certain actions if the bank s capital should fall below adequate capital standards as a result of operating losses  or if its regulators otherwise determine that it has insufficient capital or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices 
among other matters  the corrective actions may include  but are not limited to  requiring us and or the bank to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including memoranda of understanding  written agreements  supervisory letters  commitment letters  and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and refrain from unsafe and unsound practices  removing officers and directors and assessing civil monetary penalties  and taking possession of and closing and liquidating the bank 
as a result of losses incurred in recent periods  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the frb sf in december under the memorandum  we agreed to submit to the frb sf for review and approval a plan to maintain sufficient capital at the company on a consolidated basis and at the bank  a dividend policy for the bancorp  a plan to improve management of our liquidity position and funds management practices  and a liquidity policy and contingency funding plan for the bancorp 
as part of our compliance with the memorandum  on january   we submitted a three year capital and strategic plan to the frb sf which updated a previously submitted plan 
in addition  we have agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  i receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank  or ii declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
we further agreed to notify the frb sf prior to effecting certain changes to our senior executive officers and board of directors and we are limited and or prohibited  in certain circumstances  in our ability to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute severance and indemnification payments 
on march   the bank entered into the memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic 
under that memorandum  we are required  among other things  to develop and implement plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to improve our capital ratios  and to reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to develop and implement a plan to improve asset quality  and to develop and implement a plan to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
we may need to take significant action to comply with these requirements  including selling assets during adverse market conditions  raising additional capital  and limiting or ceasing the offering of profitable products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition 
in addition  we are required to retain management and directors acceptable to the dfi and the fdic 
no assurance can be given that our current management and directors are acceptable to the dfi or the fdic  that we will be able to retain or engage management and directors who are acceptable to the dfi or the fdic or that we will be able to meet the requirements of the memorandum in a timely manner 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of the memorandum with the frb sf or the dfi and the fdic in a timely manner  we could become subject to additional supervisory action  including a cease and desist order 
if our banking supervisors were to take such additional supervisory action  we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material 
table of contents negative effect on our business  our financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to further supervisory action or regulatory proceedings that could have a material negative impact on our business 
us and international financial markets and economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations  and financial condition 
the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and the demand for our products and services may decline as our borrowers and customers realize the impact of an economic slowdown and recession 
in view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in northern and southern california  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse economic conditions in the state of california 
in addition  the severity and duration of these adverse conditions are unknown and may exacerbate our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us 
we may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million and we had net charge offs of approximately million for the fiscal year ended on that date 
since there has been a significant slowdown in the real estate market in portions of los angeles  san diego  riverside  and san bernardino counties and the central valley of california where many of our commercial real estate and construction loan customers are based 
this slowdown reflects declining prices and excess inventories of homes to be sold  which has contributed to financial strain on home builders and suppliers 
in addition  the federal reserve and other government officials have expressed concerns about the commercial real estate lending concentrations of financial institutions and the ability of commercial real estate borrowers to perform pursuant to the terms of their loans 
as of december   we had approximately billion in commercial real estate and construction loans 
continuing deterioration in the real estate market generally and in the commercial real estate and residential building segments in particular could result in additional loan charge offs and provisions for loan losses in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  net income  and capital 
the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable credit losses 
actual credit losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our results of operations and capital 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the allowance for credit losses is based on management s estimate of the probable losses from our credit portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our results of operations and capital 
such excess losses could also lead to larger allowances for credit losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect results of operations and capital in those periods 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our credits  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain credit losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for credit losses 

table of contents additional requirements imposed by the dodd frank act could adversely affect us 
recent government efforts to strengthen the us financial system have resulted in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements  including expansive financial services regulatory reform legislation 
the dodd frank act  adopted in july  sets out sweeping regulatory changes 
changes imposed by the dodd frank act include i new requirements on banking  derivative and investment activities  including modified capital requirements  the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand accounts  and debit card interchange fee requirements  ii corporate governance and executive compensation requirements  iii enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations  including increases in assessment fees and deposit insurance coverage  and iv the establishment of new regulatory bodies  such as the bureau of consumer financial protection 
while certain provisions became effective immediately  much of the dodd frank act is subject to further rulemaking and or study 
accordingly  we cannot fully assess its impact on our operations and costs until these final regulations are adopted and implemented  which could be within six to months from enactment or later  depending on the regulation 
current and future legal and regulatory requirements  restrictions  and regulations  including those imposed under the dodd frank act  may adversely impact our profitability and may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes required by the legislation and related regulations and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees 
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations and supervision  and may become subject to future laws and regulations and supervision  if any  that may be enacted  that could limit or restrict our activities  may hamper our ability to increase our assets and earnings  and could adversely affect our profitability 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are or may become subject to regulation by federal  state  and local governmental authorities and various laws  regulations  regulatory guidelines  and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements or restrictions on part or all of our operations  capitalization  payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
we also must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and regulations 
a considerable amount of management time and resources have been devoted to the oversight of  and the development and implementation of controls and procedures relating to  compliance with these laws and regulations  and we expect that significant time and resources will be devoted to compliance in the future 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which we must deal with our customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
we also are or may become subject to examination  supervision  and additional comprehensive regulation by various federal  state  and local authorities with regard to compliance with these laws and regulations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws  rules  regulations  and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change 
perennially  various laws  rules and regulations are proposed  which  if adopted  could impact our operations or could substantially and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably by making compliance much more difficult or expensive  restricting our ability to originate or sell loans or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our business in particular 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
other changes to statutes  regulations  or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations  or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of 
table of contents financial services and products we may offer  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations  or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties  and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see regulation and supervision in part i item of this annual report on form k 
the fdic s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could adversely affect our earnings 
as a result of a series of financial institution failures and other market developments  the deposit insurance fund  or dif  of the fdic has been significantly depleted with a reduction in the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
as a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the dodd frank act  the fdic has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions 
if these increases are insufficient for the dif to meet its funding requirements  further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required 
we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels 
any future additional assessments  increases or required prepayments in fdic insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may experience goodwill impairment 
if our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors  we may determine that impairment charges are necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets deteriorates 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential  or spread  between the interest earned on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 

table of contents generally  the interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of re pricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
we have engaged in expansion through acquisitions and may consider additional acquisitions in the future  which could negatively affect our business and earnings 
we have engaged in expansion through acquisitions and may consider acquisitions in the future 
there are risks associated with any such expansion 
these risks include  among others  incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction  encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses  facing resistance from customers or employees  and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction 
additional country and region specific risks are associated with transactions outside the united states  including in china 
to the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions  if any  these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
our earnings  financial condition  and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
we may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings 
any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 
in addition  our ability to grow may be limited if we cannot make acquisitions 
we compete with other financial institutions with respect to proposed acquisitions 
we cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms 
we may in the future engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
in the current economic environment  and subject to any requisite regulatory consent  we may potentially be presented with opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution 
however  because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition  including preparing for integration of an acquired institution  we may face additional risks if we engage in fdic assisted transactions 
these risks include the loss of customers  strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems 
if we engage in fdic assisted transactions  we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with these transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability 

table of contents moreover  even if we were inclined to participate in an fdic assisted transaction  there are no assurances that the fdic would allow us to participate or what the terms of such transaction might be or whether we would be successful in acquiring the bank or assets that we are seeking 
we may be required to raise additional capital as a condition to  or as a result of  participation in an fdic assisted transaction 
any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
furthermore  to the extent we are allowed to  and choose to  participate in fdic assisted transactions  we may face competition from other financial institutions with respect to the proposed fdic assisted transactions 
to the extent that our competitors are selected to participate in fdic assisted transactions  our ability to identify and attract acquisition candidates and or make acquisitions on favorable terms may be adversely affected 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
we currently have operations in six other states new york  texas  washington  massachusetts  illinois  and new jersey and in hong kong 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased expenses and operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  to comply with all of the various local laws and regulations  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurring of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate  which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
a downturn in our real estate markets has hurt our business because many of our loans are secured by real estate 
the real estate collateral securing our borrowers obligations is principally located in california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  and new jersey 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  unemployment rates  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the 
table of contents properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  floods  and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the current general decline in real estate sales and prices in many markets across the united states could reduce the value of our collateral such that we may not be able to realize an amount upon a foreclosure sale equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
continued declines in real estate sales and prices coupled with any weakness in the economy and continued high unemployment will result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets  a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
the risks inherent in construction lending may continue to affect adversely our results of operations 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
the current general decline in real estate sales and prices across the united states  the decline in demand for residential real estate  economic weakness  high rates of unemployment  and reduced availability of mortgage credit  are all factors that can adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral  and thereby adversely affect our results of operations and financial results 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan secured by real property  we require an appraisal of the property 
however  an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
our interest expense may increase following the repeal of the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits 
the federal prohibition on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts was repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions can commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
we do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if the bank begins offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or to maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits  loans  and for other banking services  as well as acquisitions  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
these banks and financial institutions have greater resources than we do  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand and make acquisitions 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  they have substantially greater lending limits than we do and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 

table of contents the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies has increased the level of competition among financial services companies and may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
the impact of the new basel iii capital standards will likely impose enhanced capital adequacy standards on us 
on september   the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  announced agreement on the calibration and phase in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements  known as basel iii  which were approved in november by the g leadership 
basel iii increases the minimum tier common equity ratio to  net of regulatory deductions  and introduces a capital conservation buffer of an additional of common equity to risk weighted assets  raising the target minimum common equity ratio to 
basel iii increases the minimum tier capital ratio to inclusive of the capital conservation buffer  increases the minimum total capital ratio to inclusive of the capital buffer  and introduces a countercyclical capital buffer of up to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital for periods of excess credit growth 
basel iii also introduces a non risk adjusted tier leverage ratio of  based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets  and new liquidity standards 
the basel iii capital and liquidity standards will be phased in over a multi year period 
the federal reserve will likely implement changes to the capital adequacy standards applicable to us and the bank which will increase our capital requirements and compliance costs 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the communities that we serve 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives and certain other employees 
on march   the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic pursuant to which we are required to retain management and directors acceptable to the dfi and the fdic 
no assurance can be given that our current management or directors are acceptable to the dfi or the fdic or that we will be able to retain or engage management or directors who are acceptable to the dfi and the fdic 
if we are unable to retain such management and directors  we may be subject to further supervisory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors  and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable  illegal  or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place that seek to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors  and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond our control could adversely affect us 
natural disasters such as earthquakes  wildfires  extreme weather conditions  hurricanes  floods  and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving civil unrest  changes in government regimes  terrorism  or 
table of contents military conflict could adversely affect our business operations and those of our customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property 
these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair our borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  erode the value of loan collateral  and result in an increase in the amount of our non performing loans and a higher level of non performing assets including real estate owned  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses  which could adversely affect our earnings 
adverse conditions in asia could adversely affect our business 
a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia and  as a result  we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions in asia  including the effects of rising inflation in china and other regions 
in addition  in  we opened a branch in hong kong 
us and global economic policies  military tensions  and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the asian economies 
pandemics and other public health crises or concerns over the possibility of such crises could create economic and financial disruptions in the region 
if economic conditions in asia deteriorate  we could  among other things  be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to asia 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions in asia  and in china or taiwan in particular  may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region 
because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement between us and the us treasury  or the purchase agreement  under which we sold million of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  with a liquidation preference of  per share  or the series b preferred stock  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and the three next most highly compensated executive officers 
the standards include i ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executive officers does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  ii requiring clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer based on statements of earnings  gains  or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  iii a prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and iv agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
the adoption of the arra on february   and interim final regulations thereunder effective june   have imposed certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including the company  until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
the arra executive compensation standards are in many respects more stringent than those that continue in effect under the tarp cpp and those previously proposed by the us treasury 
the new standards include but are not limited to i prohibitions on bonuses  retention awards and other incentive compensation  other than restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants for up to one third of an employee s total annual compensation  which grants cannot vest for a period of at least two years and can be liquidated during the tarp period only in proportion to the repayment of the tarp investment at increments  ii prohibitions on golden parachute payments for departure from a company or change in control of the company  iii an expanded clawback of bonuses  retention awards  and incentive compensation if payment is based on materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other 
table of contents criteria  iv prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  v retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards  and other compensation previously provided by tarp recipients if found by the us treasury to be inconsistent with the purposes of tarp or otherwise contrary to the public interest  vi required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  and vii inclusion in a participant s proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a nonbinding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption  or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption  or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions  or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our need to continue to adapt our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line and mobile services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry and regulatory standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality  and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  and our restated bylaws  as amended  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and the sec will change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws and regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to sell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading 
table of contents volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  acquisitions of other banks or financial institutions  through fdic assisted transactions or otherwise  actions by institutional stockholders  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings  or litigation that involve or affect us  successful management of reputational risk  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  has experienced significant volatility 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
the trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including  without limitation  our financial condition  performance  creditworthiness and prospects  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  and other factors identified above in forward looking statements  and in this item a risk factors 
the capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption 
such volatility and disruption can reach unprecedented levels  resulting in downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
statutory restrictions and restrictions by our regulators on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us by limiting the amount of distributions the bancorp may receive 
state laws and our regulators may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
a substantial portion of bancorp s cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
also  the bank is subject to a restriction on dividends it may pay to bancorp under a memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic 
under the memorandum of understanding we entered into with the frb sf  we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
in our three year capital and strategic plan we submitted to the frb sf  we indicated the bank will not pay a dividend to us in in addition  we adopted a capital management and dividend policy as part of the capital plan in which we adopted a policy to refrain from paying dividends in excess of

there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve the payment of such dividends 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before bancorp  as a holder of the equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us is limited by various regulations and statutes  including california law  and our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding stock is limited by various regulations and statutes  including delaware law 
the terms of our outstanding preferred stock limit our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock and there can be no assurance of any future dividends on our common stock generally 
in connection with the purchase agreement between us and the us treasury  we issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  or the warrant  which provides that prior to the earlier of i december   and ii the date on which all of the shares of the series b preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without the consent of the us treasury  i increase the cash dividend on our common stock above

the bancorp and the bank are also each subject to additional statutory and regulatory restrictions on paying dividends 
the restrictions described above  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant  described below  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
commencing with the second quarter of  our board reduced our common stock dividend to 
per share  and commencing with the third quarter of  our board further reduced our dividend to 
per share 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future 

table of contents our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share  and the warrant as well as other potential issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared and the accretion on discount on our outstanding preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
our outstanding preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution  or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the  shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
in addition  to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur additional dilution 
we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  these sales could result in increased dilution to our stockholders 
see we may need to raise additional capital which may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment below 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock  which may negatively impact their investment 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the stockholders 
the board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of our business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected

these securities are collectively referred to herein as the trust preferred securities 
payments to investors in respect of the trust preferred securities are funded by distributions on certain series of securities issued by us  with similar terms to the relevant series of trust preferred securities  which we refer to as the junior subordinated notes 
in addition  in september  the bank issued  in subordinated debt in a private placement  which we refer to as the bank subordinated debt 
if we are unable to pay interest in respect of the junior subordinated notes which will be used to make distributions on the trust preferred securities  or if any other event of default occurs  then we will generally be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends or other distributions  or redeeming  purchasing or acquiring  any of our capital securities  including the common stock  during the next succeeding interest payment period applicable to any of the junior subordinated notes 
if the bank is unable to pay interest in respect of the bank subordinated debt  or if any other event of default has occurred and is continuing on the bank subordinated debt  then the bank will be prohibited from 
table of contents declaring or paying dividends or other distributions  or redeeming  purchasing or acquiring  any of its capital stock  during the next succeeding interest payment applicable to the bank subordinated debt 
as a result  the bank will be prohibited from making dividend payments to us  which  in turn could affect our ability to pay dividends on our capital securities  including the common stock 
moreover  any other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock  including the common stock 
in the event that any other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on the common stock  we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on the common stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements 
we may need to raise additional capital which may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment 
if economic conditions deteriorate  particularly in the california commercial real estate and residential real estate markets where our business is concentrated  we may need to raise more capital to support any additional provisions for loan losses and loan charge offs 
in addition  we may need to raise more capital to meet other regulatory requirements  if our losses are higher than expected and we believe that we may breach the target capital ratios in our three year capital and strategic plan  or to participate in fdic assisted transactions 
there can be no assurances that we would succeed in raising any such additional capital  and any capital we obtain may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock  or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to provide information to facilitate the understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the bancorp and its subsidiaries 
it should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the bank offers a wide range of financial services 
it currently operates branches in southern california  branches in northern california  eight branches in new york state  one branch in massachusetts  two branches in texas  three branches in washington state  three branches in illinois  one branch in new jersey  one branch in hong kong and two representative offices one in shanghai  china  and one in taipei  taiwan 
the bank is a commercial bank  servicing primarily individuals  professionals  and small to medium sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located 
the financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the bancorp  its subsidiaries  including the bank  and the bank s consolidated subsidiaries 
all material transactions between these entities are eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses the determination of the amount of the provision for credit losses charged to operations reflects management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in economic and business conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in the volume and severity of past due  non accrual  and adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and the effect of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and other external factors 
the nature of the process by which we determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 

table of contents the total allowance for credit losses consists of two components specific allowances and general allowances 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  we employ two primary methodologies  the individual loan review analysis methodology and the classification migration methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of our allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  and environmental factors which include trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as the national and local economy  the volume and composition of the portfolio  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 
the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with accounting standard codification asc section for non impaired credits  a general allowance is established for those loans internally classified and risk graded pass  minimally acceptable  special mention  or substandard based on historical losses in the specific loan portfolio and a reserve based on environmental factors determined for that loan group 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the allowance for credit losses is discussed in more detail in risk elements of the loan portfolio allowance for credit losses below 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
asc topic requires us to assess whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
other than temporary impairment related to credit losses will be recognized in earnings 
other than temporary impairment related to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents goodwill and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 business combinations revised  requires an entity to recognize the assets  liabilities and any non controlling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
asc topic also requires an entity to expense acquisition related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
pre acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at fair value  unless it is a non contractual contingency that is not likely to materialize  in which case  nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting and  instead  that contingency would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of asc topic  accounting for contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  formerly sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting standards require management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit in making the assessment of impairment at least annually 
the impairment testing process conducted by us begins by assigning net assets and goodwill to our three reporting units commercial lending  retail banking  and east coast operations 
we then complete step one of the impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit as determined based on the discussion below with the recorded book value or carrying amount of its net assets  with goodwill included in the computation of the carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired  and step two of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  step two of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of impairment 
step two of the impairment test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by assuming all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit would be adjusted to the current fair value  with the offset as an adjustment to goodwill 
this adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value used in step two 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
valuation of other real estate owned oreo real estate acquired in the settlement of loans is initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
specific valuation allowances on other real estate owned are recorded through charges to operations to recognize declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure 
gains on sales are recognized when certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial and continuing investment in the property are met

asc topic requires an entity to assess whether it has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  an entity must recognize an otti 
if an entity does not intend to sell the debt security and will not be required to sell the debt security  the entity must consider whether it will recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security  otti shall be considered to have occurred 
otti is then separated into the amount of the total impairment related to credit losses and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
an entity determines the impairment related to credit losses by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
otti related to the credit loss is thereafter recognized in earnings 
otti related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income

substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses

under the memorandum of understanding we entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb sf  we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
in our three year capital and strategic plan  we indicated the bank will not pay a dividend to us in the terms of our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated securities also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
if we are not current in our payment of dividends on our series b preferred stock or in our payment of interest on our junior subordinated securities  we may not pay dividends on our 
table of contents common stock 
the federal reserve board has previously issued federal reserve supervision and regulation letter sr that states that bank holding companies are expected to inform and consult with federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid 
as a result of losses incurred in  we were expected to so inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring or paying any dividends and we have agreed under the memorandum of understanding with the frb sf that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve the payment of such dividends 
under california state banking law  the bank may not without regulatory approval pay a cash dividend which exceeds the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or its net income for the last three fiscal years  less any cash distributions made during that period 
under this regulation  as of january   the bank does not have any capacity to pay dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
regulatory matters on december   the bancorp entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb sf under which we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  i receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank  or ii declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
we do not believe that this agreement regarding dividends from the bank will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we had retained a portion of the proceeds from our common stock offerings to be used  for among other things  payments of future dividends on our common and preferred stock and payments on trust preferred securities 
at december   our cash on hand totaled million which is sufficient to cover future dividends on our common stock at the current quarterly rate of 
per share  on our preferred stock  and payments on our trust preferred securities  subject to frb sf approval  for at least two years 
under the memorandum  we also agreed to submit to the frb sf for review and approval a plan to maintain sufficient capital at the company on a consolidated basis and at the bank  a dividend policy for the bancorp  a plan to improve management of our liquidity position and funds management practices  and a liquidity policy and contingency funding plan for the bancorp 
as part of our compliance with the memorandum  on january   we submitted to the frb sf a three year capital and strategic plan that updates a previously submitted plan and establishes  among other things  targets for our tier risk based capital ratio  total risk based capital ratio  tier leverage capital ratio and tangible common risk based ratio  each of which  where applicable  are above the minimum requirements for a well capitalized institution 
in addition  we agreed to notify the frb sf prior to effecting certain changes to our senior executive officers and board of directors and we are limited and or prohibited  in certain circumstances  in our ability to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute severance and indemnification payments

table of contents on march   the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the department of financial institutions dfi and the fdic pursuant to which we are required to develop and implement  within specified time periods  plans satisfactory to the dfi and the fdic to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to enhance and to improve the quality of our stress testing of the bank s loan portfolio  and to revise our loan policy in connection therewith  to develop and adopt a strategic plan addressing improved profitability and capital ratios and to reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to develop and adopt a capital plan  to develop and implement a plan to improve asset quality  including the methodology for calculating the loss reserve allocation and evaluating its adequacy  and to develop and implement a plan to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
in addition  we are required to report our progress to the dfi and fdic on a quarterly basis 
as part of our compliance with the bank memorandum  on april   we submitted to the dfi and the fdic a three year capital plan that updated the three year capital and strategic plan previously submitted to the frb sf on january   and established  among other things  targets for our tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio  each of which are above the minimum requirements for a well capitalized institution and effective june   a target tier to total tangible assets ratio

following discussions with regulators  the board of the bank established a compliance committee to  among other things  review the company s management and governance and to make recommendations based on such review 
the bancorp and the bank have taken appropriate steps to comply with the terms of their respective memorandums of understanding and we believe we are in compliance with the memorandums except that the company will make certain process improvements to its capital plan based on input from the frb sf 
in particular  on january  the board of directors of the bank appointed the compliance committee to review the company s management and governance and to make recommendations based on such review and  on february   appointed the company s audit committee to oversee the implementation of the two memoranda 
on february   net of issuance costs and fees  we raised million in new capital through a public offering of common stock  see the section capital resources stockholder s equity above 
we do not believe that the memoranda or our compliance activities will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition  including liquidity 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the memoranda  that failure could lead to additional enforcement action by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and oreo 
our policy is to place loans on non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and 
table of contents interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements 
such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off

the allowance for collateral dependent impaired loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as non performing 
we continue to monitor the collateral coverage  based on recent appraisals  on these loans on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly

troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring tdr is a formal modification of the terms of a loan when the bank  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower 
the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the amount of principal amortization  forgiveness of a portion of a loan balance or accrued interest  or extension of the maturity date 
although these loan modifications are considered under asc subtopic  formerly sfas  to be troubled debt restructurings  the loans have  pursuant to the bank s policy  performed under the restructured terms and have demonstrated sustained performance under the modified terms for six months before being returned to accrual status 
the sustained performance considered by management pursuant to its policy includes the periods prior to the modification if the prior performance met or exceeded the modified terms 
this would include cash paid by the borrower prior to the restructure to set up interest reserves 
troubled debt restructurings on accrual status totaled million at december   and were comprised of loans  an increase of million  compared to loans totaling million at december  tdrs at december   were comprised of eight retail shopping and commercial use buildings of million  six office and commercial use buildings of million  three multi family residential loans of million  two hotel loans of million  four single family residential loan of million  three land loans of million  and two commercial loans of million 
we expect that the troubled debt restructuring loans on accruing status as of december   which are all performing in accordance with their restructured terms  will continue to comply with the restructured terms because of the reduced principal or interest payments on these loans

the assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on non accrual as a result of delinquency status of over days or receipt of information indicating that full collection of principal is doubtful  or when the loan has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring 
those loans with a balance less than our defined selection criteria  generally a loan amount is  or less  are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
we obtain an appraisal to determine the amount of impairment at the date that the loan becomes impaired 
the appraisals are based on as is or bulk sale valuations 
to ensure that appraised values remain current  we generally obtain an updated appraisal every six months from qualified independent appraisers 
furthermore  if the most current appraisal is dated more than three months prior to the effective date of the impairment test  we validate the most current value with third party market data appropriate to the location and property type of the collateral 
if the third party market data indicates that the value of our collateral property values has declined since the most recent valuation date  we adjust downward the value of the property to reflect current market conditions 
if the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
if an impaired loan is expected to be collected through liquidation of the collateral  the amount of impairment  excluding disposal costs  which range between to of the fair value  depending on the size of impaired loan  is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
non accrual impaired loans are not returned to accruing status unless the unpaid interest has been brought current and full repayment of the recorded 
table of contents balance is expected or if the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments of the scheduled amounts due  and are continued to be reviewed for continued impairment until they are no longer reported as troubled debt restructurings

interest recognized on impaired loans totaled million in and million in as of december   million  or  of the million of non accrual portfolio loans was secured by real estate 
as of december   million  or  of the million of non accrual loans was secured by real estate 
in light of declining property values in the current economic downturn affecting the real estate markets  the bank has obtained current appraisals  sales contract  or other available market price information which provides updated factors in evaluating potential loss

table of contents loan interest reserves in accordance with customary banking practice  construction loans and land development loans are originated where interest on the loan is disbursed from pre established interest reserves included in the total original loan commitment 
our construction and land development loans generally include optional renewal terms after the maturity of the initial loan term 
new appraisals are obtained prior to extension or renewal of these loans in part to determine the appropriate interest reserve to be established for the new loan term 
loans with interest reserves are underwritten to the same criteria  including loan to value and if applicable  pro forma debt service coverage ratios  as loans without interest reserves 
construction loans with interest reserves are monitored on a periodic basis to gauge progress towards completion 
interest reserves are frozen if it is determined that additional draws would result in a loan to value ratio that exceeds policy maximums based on collateral property type 
our policy limits in this regard are consistent with supervisory limits and range from in the case of land to in the case of to family residential construction projects 
the following table presents the summary of loans with interest reserves balance remaining interest reserves loans extended dollars in thousands at december  construction loans land loans total at december  construction loans land loans total in  the bank had no loans on non accrual status with available interest reserves

at december   million of non accrual residential construction loans  million of non accrual non residential construction loans  and million of non accrual land loans had been originated with pre established interest reserves 
while loans with interest reserves are typically expected to be repaid in full according to the original contractual terms  some loans require one or more extensions beyond the original maturity 
typically  these extensions are required due to construction delays  delays in sales or lease of property  or some combination of these two factors 
loan concentration most of our business activity is with customers located in the predominantly asian areas of california  new york city  dallas and houston  texas  seattle  washington  boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  and new jersey 
we have no specific industry concentration  and generally our loans are collateralized with real property or other pledged collateral 
loans are generally expected to be paid off from the operating profits of the borrowers  refinancing by another lender  or through sale by the borrowers of the secured collateral 
we experienced no loan concentrations to multiple borrowers in similar activities that exceeded of total loans as of december  
table of contents the federal banking regulatory agencies issued final guidance on december   regarding risk management practices for financial institutions with high or increasing concentrations of commercial real estate cre loans on their balance sheets 
the regulatory guidance reiterates the need for sound internal risk management practices for those institutions that have experienced rapid growth in cre lending  have notable exposure to specific types of cre  or are approaching or exceeding the supervisory criteria used to evaluate the cre concentration risk  but the guidance is not to be construed as a limit for cre exposure 
the supervisory criteria are total reported loans for construction  land development  and other land represent of the institution s total risk based capital  and both total cre loans represent or more of the institution s total risk based capital and the institution s cre loan portfolio has increased or more within the last thirty six months 
in january  the bank reduced its internal limit for cre loans from of total capital to of total capital to be achieved no later than december total loans for construction  land development  and other land represented as of december   and of total risk based capital as of december  total cre loans represented as of december   and of total risk based capital as of december  see part i item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for a discussion of some of the factors that may affect us 
allowance for credit losses the bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks in the loan portfolio and off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
allowance for credit losses is comprised of allowances for loan losses and for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
with this risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner 
in addition  the board of directors of the bank has established a written credit policy that includes a credit review and control system which it believes should be effective in ensuring that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and determines whether the allowance is adequate to absorb losses in the credit portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality has resulted in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  and defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in the current period 
see part i item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance 
the allowance for loan losses was million and the allowance for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments was million at december   and represented the amount that the company believes to be sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio including unfunded commitments 
the allowance for credit losses  the sum of allowance for loan losses and for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments  was million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or

table of contents our allowance for loan losses consists of the following specific allowance for impaired loans  we provide specific allowances for loans that are not collateral dependent based on an evaluation of the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate and for loans that are collateral dependent based on the fair value of the underlying collateral  which is determined based on the most recent valuation information received  which may be adjusted based on factors such as changes in market conditions from the time of valuation 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and common risk characteristics 
the non impaired loans are grouped into segments two commercial segments  ten commercial real estate segments  three residential construction segments  three non residential construction segments  one sba segment  one installment loans segment  one residential mortgage segment  one equity lines of credit segment  and one overdrafts segment 
the allowance is provided for each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience aggregated based on loan risk classifications which takes into account the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral if collateral dependent  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio  general economic conditions  and environmental factors which include the trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as the national and local economy  volume and composition of the portfolio  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and concentration of credit 
in addition  management reviews reports on past due loans to ensure appropriate classifications 
during the third quarter of  we revised our minimum loss rates for loans rated special mention and substandard to incorporate the results of a classification migration model reflecting actual losses beginning in beginning in the third quarter of  minimum loss rates have been assigned for loans graded minimally acceptable instead of grouping these loans with the unclassified portfolio 
during the second quarter of  in light of the continued deterioration in the economy and the increases in non accrual loans and charge offs  and based in part on regulatory considerations  we shortened the period used in the migration analysis from five years to four years to better reflect the impact of the most recent charge offs  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  we increased the general allowance to reflect the higher loan delinquency trends  the weaker national and local economy and the increased difficulty in assigning loan grades  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  and we also applied the environmental factors described above to loans rated minimally acceptable  special mention and substandard  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our migration loss analysis to reduce the weighting of the first two years of the four year migration analysis by half to better reflect the impact of more recent losses  and further segmented the construction loan portfolios into three geographic segments 
the changes made during the fourth quarter of did not have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses 
during the first quarter of  we increased the number of segments for commercial real estate loans from one to ten 
in addition  we changed our migration loss analysis to use as the reserve factor for loans rated pass the total weighted average losses during the last four years for each loan segment as well as the weighting for the four year migration so that the first two years are weighted one third and the most recent two years are weighted two thirds 
the changes made during the first quarter of increased the allowance for loan losses by million 
during the second quarter of  we further refined our methodology to give greater weighting to the most recent twelve months of charge offs in the calculation of the loan loss reserve percentage for pass rated loans  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  we discontinued the weighting in the four year migration analysis for loans rated lower than pass  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  and we increased the environmental factors for purchased syndicated loans  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million

at december   our liquidity ratio defined as net cash and short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities decreased to primarily due to lower securities balances  compared to at december  the bank is a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had an approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling billion 
total advances from the fhlb of san francisco were million at december  these borrowings bear fixed rates and are secured by loans and securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the bank pledged million of its commercial loans to the federal reserve bank s discount window under the borrower in custody program 
the bank had borrowing capacity of million from federal reserve bank discount window at december  liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining billion was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
approximately of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its operating needs 
the company obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank  the issuance of additional common stock and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the issuance of the bancorp common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to the bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations and approval 
in light of the uncertain economic times and the regulatory considerations described above under dividend policy and regulatory matters  the bank did not pay a dividend to the bancorp in and is not expected to pay a dividend to the bancorp in the business activities of the bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank and limited activities in other investments 
management believes the bancorp s cash on hand of million on december   is sufficient to meet its operational needs for the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not re price at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the re pricing characteristics of our loans  securities  deposits  and borrowings on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability as well as to estimate changes to the market value of our assets and liabilities 
we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending  investing  and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the traditional business activities of extending loans  investing securities  accepting deposits  and borrowings 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies  among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 

table of contents our simulation model also projects the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would increase by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net market value of our assets and liabilities would decrease by 
quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows the carrying value of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  as well as the instruments total fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

table of contents financial derivatives it is our policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
however  we enter into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  we may protect our position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
we follow asc topic which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
as of december   we had five interest rate swap agreements outstanding with two major financial institutions in the notional amount of million for a period of three years 
these interest rate swaps were not structured to hedge against inherent interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at december   we paid a fixed rate at a weighted average rate of and received a floating month libor rate at a weighted average rate of 
the net amount accrued on these interest rate swaps of million for was recorded to reduce other non interest income compared to million for at december   we recorded million within other liabilities to recognize the negative fair value of these interest rate swaps compared to  at december  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with various counterparties to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  for foreign exchange certificates of deposit  foreign currency contracts or foreign currency option contracts entered into with our clients 
these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of these contracts as well as the related foreign currency certificates of deposit  foreign exchange contracts  or foreign currency option contracts are recognized immediately in operations as a component of non interest income 
period end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the notional amount of option contracts totaled million with a net positive fair value of  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had positive fair value  in the amount of million  at december  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a negative fair value  in the amount of million  at december  at december   the notional amount of option contracts totaled million with a net positive fair value of  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had positive fair value  in the amount of million  at december  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a negative fair value  in the amount of  at december
