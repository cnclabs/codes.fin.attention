item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and counseling services to high net worth individuals and institutions 
our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels 
in executing this strategy  we have developed broadly diversified investment management capabilities and a powerful marketing  distribution and customer service organization 
although we manage and distribute a wide range of investment products and services  we operate in one business segment  namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts 
we are a market leader in a number of investment areas  including tax managed equity  value equity  equity income  structured emerging market equity  floating rate bank loan  municipal bond  investment grade  global and high yield bond investing 
our breadth of investment management capabilities supports a wide range of products and services offered to fund shareholders  retail managed account investors  institutional investors and high net worth clients 
our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives  risk profiles  income levels and geographic representation 
our income investment strategies cover a broad duration and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax free investments 
we also offer a range of alternative investment strategies  including commodity based investments and a spectrum of absolute return strategies 
as of october   we had billion in assets under management 
our principal retail marketing strategy is to distribute funds and separately managed accounts through financial intermediaries in the advice channel 
we have a broad reach in this marketplace  with distribution partners including national and regional broker dealers  independent broker dealers  independent financial advisory firms  banks and insurance companies 
we support these distribution partners with a team of approximately sales professionals covering us and international markets 
we also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high net worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis 
through our wholly owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high net worth marketplace  including corporations  endowments  foundations  family offices and public and private employee retirement plans 
our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory  administration  distribution and service fees received from eaton vance funds and investment advisory fees received from separate accounts 
our fees are based primarily on the value of the investment portfolios we manage and fluctuate with changes in the total value and mix of assets under management 
such fees are recognized over the period that we manage these assets 
our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred sales commissions  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  investments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents market developments prevailing market conditions affect our managed asset levels  operating results and the recoverability of our investments 
since financial markets bottomed in the first half of fiscal  we have experienced significant improvement in our key financial metrics 
average assets under management increased percent in fiscal over fiscal due to higher average prices of managed assets and positive net flows 
revenue increased faster than our overall expenses in fiscal  resulting in higher operating margins 
managed asset levels average assets under management were billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal our average effective fee rate was basis points in fiscal compared to basis points in fiscal as a matter of course  investors in our sponsored open end funds and separate accounts have the ability to redeem their shares or investments at any time  without prior notice  and there are no material restrictions that would prevent them from doing so 
operating results in fiscal  our revenue increased by million  or percent  from fiscal  reflecting the percent increase in average assets under management 
our operating expenses increased by million  or percent  in the same period  partly reflecting increases in expenses tied to asset levels that increase as assets under management increase  such as certain distribution and service fees  and increases in expenses that adjust to increases in operating earnings  such as the performance based management incentives we accrue 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in our sales related expenses  which vary with the level of sales and the acquisition costs of new assets 
recoverability of our investments our million of investments consists primarily of positions in eaton vance managed funds and separate accounts entered into for investment and business development purposes 
these investments are generally in liquid debt or equity securities and are carried at fair market value 
we test our investments  including our investments in non consolidated collateralized loan obligation clo entities and investments classified as available for sale  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our investments in non consolidated clo entities and investments classified as available for sale for impairment using quantitative factors  including how long the investment has been in a net unrealized loss position  and qualitative factors  including the underlying credit quality of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if markets deteriorate during the quarters ahead  our assessment of impairment on a quantitative basis may lead us to impair investments in future quarters that were in an unrealized loss position at october  we test our investments in affiliates and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or as facts and circumstances indicate that additional analysis is warranted 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  we periodically review our deferred sales commissions and identifiable intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  
table of contents assets under management assets under management of billion on october  were percent higher than the billion reported a year earlier  reflecting positive net flows 
long term fund net inflows of billion in the fiscal year reflect billion of open end fund net inflows and billion of closed end fund net inflows offset by billion of private fund net outflows 
private and closed end fund flows include net reductions in fund leverage of billion in the fiscal year 
institutional separate account net inflows were billion  high net worth separate account net inflows were billion and retail managed account net inflows were billion 
net price declines in managed assets reduced assets under management by billion  while a decrease in cash management assets reduced assets under management by billion 
acquired assets contributed billion to assets under management 
in prior years we reported managed assets and flow data grouped by investment class equity  fixed income and floating rate income  based on the classification of underlying portfolio assets 
in fiscal  we began reporting managed assets and flow data by investment mandate  using fund or separate account investment strategy as the primary driver 
concurrent with this change  we added a new alternative category to reflect the growing importance to our business of investment mandates that are designed to exhibit low correlation to stock and bond market performance 
the alternative category includes a range of absolute return strategies  as well as commodity linked investments

we recognized impairment losses of million in fiscal related to two cash flow instrument clo entities and a synthetic clo entity 
the impairment losses associated with the two cash instrument clo entities resulted from a decrease in estimated future cash flows from the clo entities due to increases in the default rates of the underlying loan portfolios 
the impairment loss associated with the synthetic clo entity  which reduced the carrying value of our investment in that entity to zero in fiscal  resulted from a decrease in the estimated cash flows from the entity due to higher realized default rates and lower recovery rates on the reference securities underlying the synthetic clo entity s portfolio of credit default swaps 
other expense of the company s consolidated clo entity totaled million in fiscal primarily reflecting adjustments to the fair market value of the note obligations issued by the entity  which are substantially borne by other beneficial interest holders

the increase in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the losses incurred by the company s consolidated clo entity  which are substantially borne by other beneficial interest holders and therefore not included in the calculation of the company s income taxes 
the increase in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the execution of a state tax voluntary disclosure agreement in fiscal that resulted in a net reduction in our income tax expense of million and a deferred tax adjustment in fiscal related to stock based compensation expense that resulted in reduction in our income tax expense of million 
our policy for accounting for income taxes includes monitoring our business activities and tax policies for compliance with federal  state and foreign tax laws 
in the ordinary course of business  various taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions we have taken  or applicable law may not be clear 
we periodically review these tax positions and provide for and adjust as necessary estimated liabilities relating to such positions as part of our overall tax provision 
there were no significant changes in our estimates surrounding these positions in any of the periods presented

years ended october  in thousands cash flow data operating cash flows    investing cash flows    financing cash flows    
table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and investment advisory fees and other receivables 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent and percent of total assets on october  and  respectively  excluding those assets identified as assets of the consolidated clo entity 
although the company s seed investments in consolidated funds and separate accounts are primarily held in daily liquid instruments  these seed investments are not classified as liquid assets because they may be longer term in nature 
the million increase in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to an increase in cash and cash equivalent balances of million and an increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal primarily reflects net cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million  net inflows into consolidated funds from non controlling interest holders of million  proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock of million offset by the repurchase of million of non voting common stock  the payment of million of dividends to shareholders  million in contingent payments made to the sellers of the former tax advantaged bond strategies business of md sass investors services tabs in the second quarter of fiscal and the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal the million increase in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to an increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million partly offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalent balances of million 
the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal the decrease in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal primarily reflects the payment of million of dividends to shareholders  the repurchase of million of non voting common stock  the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors in the third quarter of fiscal  million in contingent payments made to the sellers of tabs in the second quarter of fiscal and additions to equipment and leasehold improvements of million partly offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock of million  net inflows into consolidated funds from non controlling interest holders of million  excess tax benefits of stock option exercises of million and payments received on a note receivable from an affiliate of million 
on october   our debt consisted of million in aggregate principal amount of percent unsecured notes due in we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks that expires on august  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at october  or at any point during the fiscal year 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of october  we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
we remain committed to growing our business and expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in new products  acquire shares of our non voting common stock  pay dividends  make strategic acquisitions  enhance technology infrastructure and pay the operating expenses of the business  which are largely variable in nature and fluctuate with product sales  revenue and assets under management 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations  which contributed 
table of contents million in fiscal  and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility  are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs and to satisfy our future commitments as more fully described in contractual obligations below 
the risk exists  however  that if we determine we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
income taxes during fiscal  the company received approval from the internal revenue service to change the company s tax accounting for certain closed end fund distribution expenses 
this change in tax accounting allows for the immediate tax deduction of current year closed end fund distribution expenses  as well as a tax deduction in the company s fiscal federal tax return for previously deferred expenses 
this change in accounting resulted in a decrease in deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease in taxes payable of million 
in conjunction with the approval of the change in tax accounting  the company filed for and received a refund of million in fiscal operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect other significant sources and uses of cash  certain significant non cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
significant sources and uses of cash that are not reflected in either revenue or operating expenses include net cash flows associated with our deferred sales commission assets capitalized sales commissions paid net of contingent deferred sales charges received as well as net cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of investments within the portfolios of our consolidated funds and separate accounts proceeds received from the sale of trading investments net of cash outflows associated with the purchase of trading investments 
significant non cash items include the amortization of deferred sales commissions and intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million reported in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities year over year primarily reflects an increase in net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders of million  the receipt of a federal income tax refund of million in fiscal associated with the change in tax accounting for certain closed end fund distribution expenses and a net decrease of million related to timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities year over year reflects significant seed investments made in consolidated funds and separate accounts in fiscal partly offset by an increase in net income 
investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  cash paid in acquisitions  cash payments and receipts on a note receivable from affiliate and the purchase and sale of available for sale investments in our sponsored funds that we do not consolidate 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash used for investing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by investing activities year over year can be primarily attributed to an increase in net proceeds received in conjunction with the net purchases and sales of available for sale investments in fiscal in fiscal and  the company made contingent payments of million and million  respectively  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
cash used for investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by investing activities year over year can be primarily attributed to a decrease in net proceeds received in conjunction with the net purchases and sales of available for sale investments in fiscal in fiscal and  the company made payments of million and million  respectively  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect distributions to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds  the purchase of additional non controlling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies and cash paid to meet redemptions by non controlling interest holders of these funds 
cash used for financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of our non voting common stock in connection with the grant of restricted share awards  the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends declared per share were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis

minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under noncancelable subleases 
this amount includes unrecognized tax benefits along with accrued interest and penalties 
in july  we committed to invest up to million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
we had invested million as of october   and the remaining commitment is included in the table above 
interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisers are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of non controlling interests is predicated  for each subsidiary  on the exercise of a series of puts held by non controlling interest holders and calls held by us 
neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling interest holders of the acquired entities remaining employed by the company 
the puts provide the non controlling interest holders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specific intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the non controlling interest holders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specified intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of an originating non controlling interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any non controlling interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made to purchase non controlling interests have been excluded from the above table  unless a put or call option has been exercised and a mandatory firm commitment exists for us to purchase such non controlling interests 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of non controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
we have presented all redeemable non controlling interests at redemption value on our consolidated balance sheet as of october  we have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of 
table of contents non controlling interests redeemable at fair value as a component of additional paid in capital and have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value as a component of net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests 
based on our calculations  the estimated redemption value of our non controlling interests  redeemable at either fair value or other than fair value  totaled million on october  compared to million on october  in conjunction with its acquisition of tabs in december  the company is obligated to make five further annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december     and there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company made a contingent payment equal to million with respect to the twelve months ended december  in february  the non controlling interest holders of fox asset management llc fox asset management executed a put option requiring the company to purchase an additional percent interest in fox asset management 
the transaction settled on march  and increased the company s ownership interest from percent to percent 
pursuant to the terms of the unit purchase agreement  no proceeds were transferred at closing 
in april  the non controlling interest holders of parametric portfolio associates exercised a put option requiring the company to purchase for million an additional interest in parametric portfolio associates representing a percent capital interest and a percent profit interest in the entity 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing in may 
the transaction reduced the capital interests held by non controlling interest holders from percent on october  to percent on october  profit interests held by non controlling interest holders  which include direct profit interests in parametric portfolio associates as well as indirect profit interests granted as part of a long term equity incentive plan of that entity  increased to percent on october  from percent on october   reflecting an additional percent profit interest granted under the long term equity plan partly offset by the repurchase of the percent profit interest referenced above 
in june  the company exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors to sell to us an additional interest in parametric risk advisors for million 
the transaction increased our ownership interest from to percent 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing 
capital interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital management totaled percent on october  and profit interests held by non controlling interest holders  which include direct profit interests in atlanta capital management as well as indirect profit interests granted as part of a long term equity incentive plan of that entity  increased to percent on october  from percent on october   reflecting an additional percent profit interest granted under the long term equity plan 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
consolidation of variable interest entities effective november   we adopted new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this accounting guidance provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be considered a vie and  if so  whether our involvement with the entity results in a variable interest in the entity 
if we determine that we do have a variable interest in the entity  we must then perform an analysis to determine whether we should be treated as the primary beneficiary of the entity 
if we determine that we should be treated as the primary beneficiary of the entity  we are required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the entity into the consolidated financial statements of the company 
a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has a controlling financial interest in the vie 
a company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb the losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of a vie is highly complex 
in our analysis  we must make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows of the vie 
these estimates and assumptions relate primarily to market interest rates  credit default rates  pre payment rates  discount rates  the marketability of certain securities and the probability of certain outcomes 
there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the entity 
while we believe that our evaluation is appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments and assumptions may affect the determination of the primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation of the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques to measure fair value 
this fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories based on the nature of the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  an investment s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
level unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 
level observable inputs other than level unadjusted quoted market prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for 
table of contents identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which redemptions by the purchasing shareholder are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years from purchase 
distribution plan payments received from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received from redeeming shareholders of these funds are generally applied to reduce our unamortized deferred sales commission assets 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commission asset for impairment on a quarterly basis 
in our impairment analysis  we compare the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset in the form of distribution fees over the remaining useful life of the deferred sales commission asset to determine whether impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in operating income as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital management and parametric portfolio associates  which share similar economic characteristics  to a single reporting unit 
management believes that the inclusion of these entities in a single reporting unit for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing most accurately reflects the synergies achieved in acquiring these entities  namely centralized distribution of similar products and services to similar clients 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisition of tabs and fox asset management to a second reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying amounts  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by either using the income approach or by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach  depending on the reporting unit 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  current period actual results  and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management at the reporting unit level 
budgeted results for future periods are most significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the growth in assets under management  future revenue run rates and future operating margins 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and 
table of contents forward multiples of both revenue and ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets amortized identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
non amortizing intangible assets generally represent the cost of mutual fund management contracts acquired 
non amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the management contracts acquired to their carrying values 
the company establishes fair value for purposes of impairment testing using the income approach 
if the carrying value of a management contract acquired exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
accounting standards requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and to make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment takes into account our forecast of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods  our experience with the tax attributes expiring unused  tax planning alternatives and other tax considerations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate 
table of contents risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment but are not subject to significant variability 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
non controlling interests direct interests in our majority owned subsidiaries are puttable at established multiples of earnings before interest and taxes and  as such  are considered redeemable at other than fair value 
the company s non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value are recorded in temporary equity at estimated redemption value and changes in estimated redemption value are recorded in earnings

as part of this program we enter into futures and forward contracts to hedge exposure to certain equity instruments held within the portfolios of these separately managed accounts and consolidated funds 
the contracts negotiated are short term in nature 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes

in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates trading debt securities  available for sale securities sponsored funds  total  from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interests in the non consolidated cash instrument clo entities that are included in investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
as an investor in a non consolidated clo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the non consolidated clo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery experiences of the underlying instruments held by the non consolidated clo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in defaults  non consolidated clo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in non consolidated clo entities was valued at million as of october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly  most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states and the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted

our exposure to currency movements will likely increase as our business outside of the united states grows 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
