business environment the nation s engagement in combating threats to us national security around the world  coupled with the need to equip and modernize us military forces  drives department of defense funding levels 
as a defense contractor  our financial performance is influenced by the allocation and prioritization of us defense spending 
for fiscal year fy  the president requested billion for the department of defense  including approximately billion for procurement and research and development r d 
procurement and r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of our us defense revenues 
as of february   the congress has not approved the president s fy budget request 
consequently  the us government  including the department of defense  is operating under a continuing resolution cr  which funds the pentagon at fy funding levels through early march for fy  congress appropriated billion for the defense department  including approximately billion for investment accounts 
we anticipate that congress will further consider the fy defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current cr 
this consideration would likely result in either an extension of the cr  thereby keeping fy funding at fy levels  or the passage of a funding bill 
in the case of an extended cr  we are actively engaged with our customers and the congress to ensure funding required for critical programs is not disrupted 
in either case  budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding  and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years 
to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq  defense budgets have also included supplemental funding 
while some of our programs have received supplemental funds  most of our funding is now derived from base budgets 
for fy  the president has requested approximately billion in supplemental funding  including approximately percent for investment accounts 
future year spending plans forecast a reduction in supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration s plan to gradually reduce troop levels in iraq and afghanistan 
for fy  the president has requested total defense funding of billion  including billion in supplemental funding 
the budget requests billion for investment accounts 
the pentagon s five year base spending plan  submitted with the fy funding request  reflects low single digit growth in the near term with growth slowing in later years 
this plan incorporates approximately billion of projected cuts when compared with the previous five year plan 
given force structure levels and current threat levels  the majority of those cuts are not manifested in investment accounts 
rather  investment accounts are projected to display low single digit growth over the five year period  with procurement funding for mature programs growing and r d funding for developmental programs declining over the period 
logo in today s dynamic budget environment  the success of our us defense business is enhanced by the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget  our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs  our ability to evolve our products to address a fast changing threat environment  and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded 
while our nation s budget deficits will influence government spending decisions  we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  the number of troops deployed globally  coupled with the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in iraq and afghanistan since  the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation s economy and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare 
given today s tenuous geopolitical landscape  governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to diverse defense export opportunities 
we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies  both from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses 
while the revenue potential can be significant  international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  changing priorities and overall spending pressures 
as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world  we expect our international sales and exports to grow 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents business jet market conditions continued to improve in  in line with the broader economic recovery  particularly in the large cabin market 
our aerospace group benefitted from increased flying hours  higher aircraft services activity  improved new aircraft order interest and declining customer defaults 
barring any further economic turmoil  we believe the diversity and duration of our business jet backlog positions the aerospace group for further improvement in and beyond 
continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive aerospace s long term growth  particularly as the group begins producing its newest aircraft offerings  the g and the g  in similarly  we believe that aircraft service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business jet fleet 
in these dynamic markets  we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development  disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives 
our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth  margin improvement and efficient conversion of earnings into cash 
our record of excellent cash flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations focuses on the material financial measures we use to evaluate our performance  including revenues  operating earnings and margins  cash flow  and orders and backlog 
a consolidated overview is followed by a more detailed review of operating performance for each of our business groups aerospace  combat systems  marine systems and information systems and technology 
for the aerospace group  results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services  consistent with how the group is managed 
for the defense business groups  the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with supplemental discussion of specific significant contracts and programs that drive the groups results 
in the aerospace group  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section  sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft 
revenues in the aerospace group s aircraft outfitting and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service 
changes in revenues in this group result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries both green and outfitted  the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities  the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre owned aircraft sold 
in general  operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft  our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft  and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid cabin aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed  the number and type of pre owned aircraft sold  and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group  which include selling expenses and r d costs 
in the defense business groups  the majority of the revenues are generated by long term government contracts 
we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered 
as a result  changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume 
year over year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels  delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 
operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume  performance or contract mix ie  higher vs 
lower margin work 
performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract or the estimated costs required to complete the contract 
contract mix can result in higher or lower earnings and margins due to contract type eg  fixed price cost reimbursable or the phase of work eg  development production within those contracts 
the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event caused a change in the profitability of a contract eg  contract losses claims

table of contents logo consolidated overview review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin general dynamics revenues increased in compared with  with higher revenues in the aerospace  marine systems and information systems and technology groups offset in part by lower combat systems revenues 
aerospace revenues improved primarily due to higher aircraft services volume 
growing activity in marine systems us navy ship programs resulted in increased revenues for the group in increases across the information systems and technology portfolio contributed to revenue growth in the group in  particularly in the tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses 
revenues decreased in the combat systems group due primarily to reduced volume on us military vehicle programs 
our operating earnings growth significantly outpaced our sales growth in each of our four business groups reported earnings growth compared with earnings performance was particularly strong in the aerospace and combat systems groups  both of which realized significant operating leverage in in the aerospace group  operating margins were up due to improved pricing on aircraft services work and large cabin aircraft deliveries  and the absence of pre owned aircraft losses  which negatively impacted operating margins 
combat systems margin expansion resulted from productivity improvements across the group  particularly in the us military vehicle business  and a favorable contract mix  including reduced engineering and development work 
operating margins were steady in the marine systems group and down slightly in the information systems and technology group due to a shift in contract mix 
as a result  our overall operating margins increased by basis points in compared with review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin in  strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset reduced business jet deliveries in the aerospace group  resulting in significant top line revenue growth over the combat systems and marine systems groups generated double digit revenue growth on the strength of military vehicle and shipbuilding and repair programs 
in the information systems and technology group  increased volume in each of the group s us operations drove the group s revenue growth 
revenues decreased in the aerospace group in following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries in response to a significant downturn in the business jet market 
our operating earnings increased slightly in over as earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was offset by reduced earnings in the aerospace group 
overall  our operating margins decreased by basis points in compared with operating margins were up significantly in the marine systems group due to strong program execution  while margins were steady in the information systems and technology group and down in the combat systems and aerospace groups 
cash flow cash flows from operations in exceeded net earnings for the th consecutive year 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  billion in and billion in over the three year period  we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock  pay dividends and repay maturing debt 
our net debt  debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities  was at year end compared with general dynamics annual report 
table of contents billion at the end of this decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployment activities billion of share repurchases  of dividends paid  of company sponsored research and development  of capital expenditures  of contributions to our retirement plans and spent on acquisitions during the year 
backlog and estimated potential contract value logo our total backlog  including funded and unfunded portions  was billion at the end of compared with billion at year end strong orders across our defense businesses resulted in a book to bill ratio orders divided by revenues higher than  despite increased revenues in orders in our defense businesses were complemented by improving order activity in the aerospace group  particularly in the second half of the year 
the aerospace group s total backlog was billion at the end of  compared with billion at year end aerospace funded backlog was billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
net orders  adjusted for customer defaults  increased sequentially each quarter in however  aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in  resulting in the backlog decline 
the aerospace unfunded backlog of at the end of consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in to billion at the end of the year  compared with billion at the end of the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
over half of the decline in our defense backlog during was in marine systems  which traditionally receives large  multi year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods 
the funded portion of the defense backlog was billion at the end of this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 
our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft  which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 
customers use idiq contracts for several reasons  including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements  which set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of our estimated potential contract value is composed of multiple award idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders 
we include only our estimate of the value we will receive under these arrangements 
the estimated contract value also includes idiq contracts for which we have been designated as the sole source supplier to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies 
we believe our customers intend to fully implement these products and systems 
because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts  if the customer exercises the option 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long term agreements with fleet customers 
we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
on december   the estimated potential contract value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  up significantly from billion at the end of this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
the estimated potential contract value in the combat systems group doubled from year end  while the information systems and technology group s estimated potential contract value increased nearly percent 
we expect to realize this value over the next to years  reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future 
other information net interest expense was in  in and in additional debt issued in and resulted in the increase from to the decrease in was due largely to the repayment of of fixed rate notes in the third quarter of general dynamics annual report

review of business groups aerospace review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s revenues increased in compared with due primarily to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year 
aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues remained consistent with levels  with an increase in manufacturing volume offset by reduced outfitting work 
aircraft manufacturing revenues increased percent in  the result of additional deliveries and a more favorable mix of green gulfstream aircraft 
the decline in aircraft outfitting revenues was associated primarily with the group s completions work for other original equipment manufacturers oems  reflecting decreased oem production across the broader business jet market 
aircraft services revenues  which include both gulfstream and jet aviation s maintenance and repair work  fixed base operations and aircraft management services  increased percent in  reflecting the growing installed base of business jet aircraft and increased utilization as the business jet market recovers following the economic downturn 
revenues from sales of pre owned aircraft were down slightly from the group s operating earnings improved significantly in compared with  with improvements in all areas of the group s portfolio 
the components of the earnings growth were as follows aircraft manufacturing and outfitting pre owned aircraft aircraft services sg a other total increase in operating earnings the group s aircraft manufacturing and outfitting earnings were up in compared with due to the increase in aircraft manufacturing volume  as well as improved pricing on large cabin aircraft and mix shift within large cabin models 
this increase was offset in part by reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults 
margins for these activities were up basis points compared with pre owned aircraft earnings improved significantly from  when the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre owned aircraft inventory 
pricing in the pre owned market has improved since mid  particularly for large cabin aircraft  although inventories across the industry remain higher than historic norms 
in  the aerospace group realized modest profits on its pre owned sales  took no pre owned aircraft write downs and ended the year with no pre owned aircraft in inventory 
consistent with the increased volume  aircraft services earnings continued to improve from margins associated with aircraft services were up basis points in due to improved marketplace pricing 
the group s operating earnings in were also favorably impacted by the timing of r d expenditures and the absence of severance costs associated with workforce reductions in as a result of the factors discussed above  the group s overall operating margins increased basis points in compared with review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s revenues decreased in  the result of a decline in sales of gulfstream aircraft that was offset in part by the addition of jet aviation  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of we reduced gulfstream s aircraft production  primarily in the group s mid cabin general dynamics annual report 
table of contents models  in response to the market downturn in late as a result  aircraft manufacturing revenues decreased significantly in compared with gulfstream aircraft services revenues were down in due to reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance 
the group s operating earnings declined in compared with due primarily to the factors noted above 
the earnings decline associated with decreased gulfstream aircraft deliveries was mitigated by cost reduction initiatives  liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts  and the fact that the majority of the reduction in deliveries was in our lower margin mid cabin aircraft 
as a result  aircraft manufacturing margins increased in over despite the decline in volume during the year 
aircraft services earnings were steady  as the addition of jet aviation offset a decrease at gulfstream 
however  competitive marketplace pressures reduced margins 
operating earnings in were also negatively impacted by losses on pre owned aircraft inventories and severance costs associated with workforce reductions 
overall  the group s operating margins decreased basis points in compared with backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the aerospace group finished with a total backlog of billion  of which billion was funded 
the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft in since the introduction of the g in customer demand improved throughout the year  with net orders  adjusted for customer defaults  improving sequentially in each quarter of however  aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in  resulting in the backlog decline 
we expect net order activity to remain strong in the group s large cabin backlog remains well positioned  with an to month period between customer order and aircraft delivery 
while improving  conditions in the mid cabin market remain difficult  though these aircraft represent a small share of the group s portfolio 
order activity has been further strengthened by the group s newest aircraft models  the g and the g both of these aircraft continue to perform well in flight testing and remain on track for aircraft certification 
the g and the g are scheduled to enter service in and  respectively 
over the past few years  the group s customer base has become increasingly diverse  both in customer type and geographic region 
approximately two thirds of the group s year end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers  though we are seeing renewed interest from large public companies 
while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america  international customers comprise nearly percent of the group s backlog  with growing order interest in emerging markets  particularly from the asia pacific region 
total backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long term agreements with fleet customers 
these arrangements totaled billion at the end of and are included in estimated potential contract value 
outlook we expect an increase of approximately to percent in the group s revenues in compared with  the result of increased large cabin aircraft deliveries  including initial green deliveries of the g  and continued growth in aircraft services activity 
we expect the aerospace group s margins to be in the mid to high percent range  down modestly from  due to reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults and increasing service activity 
combat systems review of vs

the decrease in the group s revenues consisted of the following us military vehicles weapons systems and munitions european military vehicles total decrease in revenues in the group s us military vehicle business  lower mine resistant  ambush protected mrap vehicle production and reduced engineering work represented the majority of the decline in revenues from the group s deliveries of mrap vehicles have fluctuated over the past two years in response to the customer s urgent deployment needs 
the reduction in activity on engineering programs related primarily to the cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs general dynamics annual report 
table of contents program and decreased volume on the marine corps expeditionary fighting vehicle efv 
these declines were offset in part by increased volume on the group s foreign military sales fms contracts to provide light armored vehicles lavs and tanks to international customers 
revenues were steady in the group s weapons systems and munitions businesses 
increased sales of axles  largely in the military market  and higher demand for the group s propellant products and munitions in canada  were offset in part by lower armor kit production and the completion of deliveries of detection systems that protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 
revenues in the group s european military vehicle business decreased in as a result of the ramp down of the leopard tank program for the spanish government and lower activity on the group s pandur and piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers 
increased activity on other vehicle contracts  including the eagle vehicle for germany  helped offset these decreases 
despite the decline in revenues  the combat systems group s operating earnings increased slightly in productivity improvements across the group  particularly in the us military vehicle business  and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin improvement in the group s operating margins increased basis points in compared with review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin in  the combat systems group s revenues increased significantly compared with due to strong contributions from each of the group s businesses 
in the group s us military vehicle business  increased stryker wheeled combat vehicle and abrams main battle tank volume was the primary contributor of the revenue growth 
revenues were up in the group s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to the acquisition of axletech international in december  increased production of armor kits and an increase in deliveries of hydra rockets 
the group s european military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in as a result of higher activity on several wheeled vehicle production programs 
the combat systems group s operating earnings grew in  though at a lower rate than revenues  resulting in a basis point decrease in operating margins compared with the operating margins in were influenced by a favorable program mix in the us military vehicle business

combat systems backlog does not include approximately billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group s anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options 
the group s estimated potential contract value doubled since year end due to contracts awarded in  including the specialist vehicle and hydra rocket programs 
outlook we expect combat systems revenues to remain in the billion range in with growth in international vehicle contracts  steady volume on us weapons and munitions programs  and a reduction in volume on some of the group s us vehicle programs 
we expect the group s operating margins to be approximately percent  down modestly from due to a shift in program mix 
marine systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin the marine systems group s revenues increased in compared with as growth in several us navy programs offset a decline in commercial ship construction 
the increase in revenues consisted of the following multi year navy ship construction other navy ship design  construction  engineering and repair commercial ship construction total increase in revenues the group s multi year ship construction programs for the us navy include virginia class submarines  ddg and ddg destroyers  and t ake combat logistics ships 
the principal driver of revenue growth in was increased activity on the virginia class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year in the group delivered the seventh boat under the program in while construction continued on the next five boats 
deliveries of the remaining boats under contract are scheduled through in our surface combatant business  volume decreased on the ddg arleigh burke program as the current multi ship contract nears completion 
offsetting this decline was an increase in activity on the group s design and construction contract for the first ddg zumwalt class destroyer 
the remaining two ddg destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery in and  and the first ddg delivery is scheduled in activity on the group s t ake program was down in as construction continued on the remaining four ships 
the group delivered the ninth and th ships in  and deliveries of the last four ships are scheduled through in  the group also began advanced design efforts for the mobile landing platform mlp program 
in addition to these ship construction programs  revenues were up significantly in on the group s engineering programs  particularly work associated with the next generation ballistic missile submarine ssbn 
the group is performing initial concept studies  including design of a common missile compartment for both the us navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom 
the group s ship repair work has remained steady in following significant growth in in  the group completed construction on the final two ships of a five ship commercial product carrier contract 
given the success of this program  the age of the fleet of jones act ships and environmental regulations that require double hull tankers and impose emission control limits  we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities as the economy recovers 
the marine systems group s operating earnings increased in consistent with the increase in revenues 
operating margins remained steady compared with  though the group is undergoing a shift in contract mix 
activity on the group s destroyer programs is moving from the fixed price ddg program to the cost reimbursable ddg contract  and the virginia class program is transitioning from the mature block ii contract to the block iii contract 
favorable performance on the t ake and commercial product carrier programs in helped offset this mix shift 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin revenues were up significantly in across the marine systems group 
increased activity on the virginia class program in preparation of starting construction of two submarines per year contributed almost two thirds of the group s increase in revenues 
volume also increased on the ddg and the group s engineering and repair programs for the navy 
lower activity on the ddg and t ake programs slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in the marine systems group s operating earnings increased significantly in as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its businesses  the group increased program earnings rates in on the virginia class  ddg  ddg and commercial product carrier programs 
these improvements increased the group s overall margins by basis points in  a significant improvement following a basis point margin increase in backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the marine systems group s backlog consists of long term submarine and ship construction programs  as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts 
the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years 
for example  in  the group received a billion contract for the construction of eight virginia class submarines to be delivered through  increasing backlog to an all time high of billion at the end of consistent with this historical pattern  as the group has performed on these multi year contracts  the backlog has decreased to billion at year end the group s funded backlog was billion at the end of both and the virginia class submarine program was the group s largest program in and is the largest contract in the group s backlog 
the group s backlog at year end included billion for virginia class submarines 
as the prime contractor on the virginia class program  we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner 
navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group s backlog 
these include the arleigh burke class ddg and zumwalt class ddg destroyer programs 
the group s backlog at the end of included for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first ddg in  the group received approximately in orders under the ddg program  including continued engineering and support services  long lead construction for the second ship and long lead material for the third ship 
the group expects to be awarded construction contracts for the second and third ddg ships in at year end  the backlog also included approximately for the remaining two ddg destroyers under contract 
the navy plans to continue the ddg program  and the group expects to receive an award for an additional ddg in following funding for long lead material for this ship in the marine systems group s backlog at year end included approximately for the four remaining ships under the navy s t ake combat logistics ship program 
in  we received construction contracts for the last two ships of the program 
the year end backlog also included approximately for the group s second ship under the navy s littoral combat ship lcs program  scheduled for delivery in  and for the mlp program 
the navy plans to build three mlp auxiliary support ships  and the contract for construction of the first ship is scheduled to be awarded in in addition  the marine systems group s backlog at year end included approximately billion for engineering  repair  overhaul and other services  including engineering and design efforts for the next generation ssbn 
outlook we expect the marine systems group s revenues in to remain near levels as increased virginia class production and submarine engineering activity is offset by lower ddg  t ake and commercial volume 
we expect the group s operating margins to decline to the low percent range due to the continued mix shift in ship construction programs

termination of a program 
as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to our expectations  the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories  we  along with the boeing company  could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion at december  if this were the outcome  we would owe half of the total  or approximately billion pretax 
our after tax cash obligation would be approximately we believe we have sufficient resources  including access to capital markets  to pay such an obligation  if required 
investing activities we used billion in  billion in and in for investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions  capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities 
investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities 
business acquisitions

see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were in  in and in the decrease in and compared with resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the aerospace and marine systems groups 
during  the aerospace group announced a new  seven year facilities expansion project at the group s savannah campus 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately in  less than percent of revenues 
marketable securities 
as a result of lower market interest rates  we have expanded our investments in available for sale and held to maturity securities in recent years to generate additional return 
net sales maturities of these securities were in compared with net purchases of in and net sales maturities of in financing activities we used in  in and billion in for financing activities

during that year we also repaid of fixed rate notes  of senior notes and of term debt on their scheduled maturity dates 
we issued billion of five year fixed rate notes in december and another of two year fixed rate notes in june we used the proceeds from the fixed rate notes for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings 
in august  we repaid of fixed rate notes on their scheduled maturity date 
we ended with no commercial paper outstanding  and our total debt balance was down approximately from  resulting in a debt to equity ratio of percent  down percentage points from year end we have approximately billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon 
these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program 
we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 
the next material repayment of long term debt is of fixed rate notes scheduled to mature in july of as we approach the maturity date  we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations  including scheduled debt maturities 
dividends 
our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of per share on march   the th consecutive annual increase 
the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to per share in march and per share in march share repurchases 
our board of directors has historically supported management s tactical repurchase of our shares  typically in repurchase authorizations of million share increments 
we repurchased million shares on the open market in  million shares in and million shares in as a result  we reduced our shares outstanding by percent in the past year and by percent since on february   the board authorized management to repurchase up to an additional million shares  about percent of our total shares outstanding 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares as part of our capital deployment activities in the future 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents non gaap management metrics we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns 
in  for the th consecutive year  net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings 
we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions  continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares 
as described below  we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and to earn a return on the deployment of that capital 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions  repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends 
we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows year ended december net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow from operations cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow from operations over the past five years  we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period  an average percent conversion rate 
we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and long term liquidity needs 
we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy 
return on invested capital 
we believe roic is a useful measure for investors  because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year 
net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after tax interest and amortization expense 
as a result of our continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment  roic has grown basis points since roic for through is calculated as follows year ended december earnings from continuing operations after tax interest expense after tax amortization expense net operating profit after taxes average debt and equity return on invested capital general dynamics annual report

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition 
we account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses  either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit general dynamics annual report 
table of contents over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  contract milestones or units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion  we use such output measures 
otherwise  we use input measures 
we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract 
our contracts for the manufacture of business jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 
we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  we recognize the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including general and administrative expenses on government contracts 
we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned 
while we have applied this method consistently for more than years  most contractors use the cumulative catch up method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts 
we review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 
goodwill 
since  we have acquired businesses at a total cost of approximately billion  including three in in connection with these acquisitions  we have recognized billion of goodwill 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in our backlog  our performance and profitability under our contracts  our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 
this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top down analyses  including a market assessment of our enterprise value 
beyond the annual impairment test  we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 
the fair value of each of our reporting units on december   substantially exceeded its carrying value 
commitments and contingencies 
we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid 
we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts and recovered from the government 
we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
we determine the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on our best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post retirement benefit plans  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under deferred contract costs  our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans 
we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
accordingly  the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 
we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and investments 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this annual report on form k for a discussion of these risks 
the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we had billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on december   and billion on december  the increase in the amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts is due to significant international contract awards in a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses gain loss recognized unrecognized this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar  euro canadian dollar and euro pound sterling exchange rates 
we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments  when taken together  do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations and variable rate commercial paper 
on december   we had billion par value of fixed rate debt 
we had no commercial paper outstanding on december  our fixed rate debt obligations are not putable  and we do not trade these securities in the market 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 
investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of one year 
on december   we held billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities 
our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa 
given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than one month on december   a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values
