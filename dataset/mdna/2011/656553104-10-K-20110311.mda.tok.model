item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a wayzata  minnesota based full service ems contract manufacturer of wire and cable assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  higher level assemblies and box builds for a wide range of industries 
we serve three major markets within the ems industry aerospace and defense  medical  and the industrial market which includes industrial equipment  transportation  vision  agriculture  oil and gas 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  fairmont  merrifield  milaca and wayzata 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin  monterrey  mexico  and as of january   mankato  minnesota 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are built to the customer design specifications and consist of a wide range of simple to highly complex manufacturing processes 
during  we continued our supply chain and lean manufacturing initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our initiatives focused on improving our ability to promise based on our capabilities and scheduling as well as improving our manufacturing processes and yields by doing it right the first time 
our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base by focusing on sales and marketing efforts that fit our value added service strategy 
our mexico operation allows for medium volume and mix with lower cost production alternatives when the opportunities are presented 
we also benefit from our relationships with asian manufacturers and suppliers that allow us to meet higher volume  lower mix and lower cost customer requirements when lead times and product stability are not as critical 
in the first half of we saw our revenues stabilize and customer confidence improve 
our day backlog increased steadily leading to a double digit revenue growth for the year 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cost reduction and capacity consolidation efforts which were completed in third quarter  account for the significant improvements in gross profit performance in our net income in was  or per diluted common share compared to net loss of  or per diluted common share in we continued to focus on cash management and cash conservation throughout cash from operating activities was  for the year 
on january  we entered into the first amendment to the third amended and restated credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank wfb which provides a million line of credit through may  we believe our financing arrangements and cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs through the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical estimates that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of manufactured products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we also provide engineering services separate from the manufacture of a product 
revenue for engineering services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  providing standalone fair value to our customers 
our engineering services are short term in nature 
in addition  we have another separate source of revenue that comes from short term repair services  which are recognized upon completion of the repairs  and the repaired products are shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling costs charged to our customers are included in net sales  while the corresponding shipping expenses are included in cost of goods sold 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on outstanding accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of accounts receivable  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have historically not experienced significant bad debts expense and believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our inventory based on current usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we believe the total reserve at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge might be required to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of  on a building held for sale 
in connection with the closing of two facilities in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  on certain property and equipment that were no longer being used in operations 
valuation allowance we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against these assets  thereby increasing income tax expense or decreasing the income tax benefit in the period the determination is made 
as of december  we expect to recover our deferred tax assets in their entirety  and thus no valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting estimates and the underlying judgments and uncertainties of those estimates  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially
