results of operations economic outlook the current economic environment has made consumers more cautious 
this has led to reduced consumer spending  to consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products and to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items  all of which have impacted safeway s sales

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses 
we then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return 
any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
for example  self insurance expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes  claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense 
however  these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection  and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified 
the discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses 
since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process  we are able to quantify its impact 
the discount rate  which is based on the united states treasury note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years  was in  in and in a basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability by approximately million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
some of the many sources of uncertainty in the company s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels  medical fee schedules  medical utilization guidelines  vocation rehabilitation and apportionment 
store lease exit costs and impairment charges safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
at any one time  safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets 
while individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions  the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material 
employee benefit plans the company recognizes in its balance sheet a liability for the underfunded status of its employee benefit plans 
the company measures plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status as of fiscal year end 
additional disclosures are provided in note k to the consolidated financial statements  set forth in part ii  item of this report 
the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note k to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the amount by which actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects recognized expense in such future periods 
while safeway believes 
table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for  the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended january   the average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
the deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during led to a substantial reduction in the year average rate of return on pension assets 
we expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return 
the following table summarizes actual allocations for safeway s plans at year end plan assets asset category target equity fixed income cash and other total the investment policy with regard to safeway s pension plans also emphasizes the following key objectives maintain a diversified portfolio among asset classes and investment styles  maintain an acceptable level of risk in pursuit of long term economic benefit  maximize the opportunity for value added returns from active investment management while establishing investment guidelines and monitoring procedures for each investment manager to ensure the characteristics of the portfolio are consistent with the original investment mandate  and maintain adequate controls over administrative costs 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for safeway s pension plans are as follows dollars in millions united states canada percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase expected return on assets pt discount rate pt cash contributions to the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans are expected to total approximately million in and totaled million in  million in and million in goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the test to 
table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries evaluate for impairment is a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a reporting unit is either the equivalent to  or one level below  an operating segment 
each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
our operating segments are our retail divisions 
our reporting units are generally consistent with our operating segments 
as a result of the company s annual impairment test  safeway recorded a non cash impairment charge in the amount of  million pre tax in to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
the impairment was due primarily to safeway s reduced market capitalization and a weak economy 
the difficult economic environment negatively impacted all of safeway s divisions  however  due to their large goodwill balances  the goodwill impairment resulted primarily from the vons and eastern divisions 
based upon the results of our analysis  no impairment of goodwill was indicated in or determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on an average of the guideline company method and the discounted cash flow method 
these methods are based on historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit and consider  sales  gross profit  operating profit and cash flows and general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may be substantially different than the results forecasted in our estimate of a reporting unit s fair value  resulting in additional goodwill impairment in the future 
additionally  the aggregate fair value of all the reporting units is reconciled to safeway s total market capitalization 
therefore  a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could also result in additional impairment charges 
however  the majority of the remaining million of goodwill is at reporting units that have estimated fair value that is at least greater than book value 
reporting units  whose fair value exceeds book value by less than  have total goodwill of million 
income tax contingencies the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
these tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly 
this requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the company s effective tax rate and cash flows in future years

for example  cash contributions were million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in the financial markets during resulted in a substantial reduction in the fair value of the retirement plan assets 
in and  the financial markets improved 
despite the improvement  the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets in each of the last three years 
as a result  cash contributions to pension and post retirement plans are expected to increase to approximately million in if return on plan assets is less than expected or if discount rates decline  plan contributions could increase significantly in and beyond

free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash flow from operating activities adjusted to exclude payables related to third party gift cards  net of receivables  less net cash flow used by investing activities
