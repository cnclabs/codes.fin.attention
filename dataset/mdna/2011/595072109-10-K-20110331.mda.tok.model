table of contents overview we are a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services 
in june we established a new wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
the average amount financed by timepayment during was approximately  while leasecomm historically financed contracts averaging approximately  our portfolio consists of water filtration systems  security equipment  automotive repair equipment  restaurant equipment and other business equipment leased to commercial enterprises 
we derive the majority of our revenues from leases originated and held by us  payments on service contracts  rental contracts and fee income 
historically  we have funded the majority of our leases and contracts through our revolving credit loans  term loans  cash from operations and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent our subordinated debt programs 
on august   we entered into a three year revolving line of credit with a bank syndicate led by sovereign bank sovereign based on qualified timepayment lease receivables 
the total commitment under the facility was originally million  and was subsequently increased to million in july  to million in february  and most recently to million in connection with a july  amendment 
outstanding borrowings are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets 
prior to the july amendment  outstanding borrowings bore interest at prime plus or at a london interbank offered rate libor plus  in each case subject to a minimum rate of 
following the july amendment  outstanding borrowings bear interest at prime plus or libor plus  without being subject to any minimum rate 
under the terms of the facility  loans are prime rate loans  unless we elect libor loans 
if a libor loan is not renewed at maturity it automatically converts to a prime rate loan 
as a part of the july amendment  the maturity date of the facility was extended to august  at our option upon maturity  the unpaid principal balance may be converted to a six month term loan 
in a typical lease transaction  we originate a lease through our nationwide network of equipment vendors  independent sales organizations and brokers 
upon our approval of a lease application and verification that the lessee has received the equipment and signed the lease  we pay the dealer for the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by us are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  we are scheduled to receive payments sufficient to cover our borrowing costs and the cost of the underlying equipment and to provide us with an appropriate profit 
we pass along some of the costs of our leases and contracts by charging collection fees  loss and damage waiver fees  late fees and other service fees  when applicable 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides us with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in our portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  in the past  we have also from time to time acquired service contracts under which a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  we would purchase the right to the payment stream under the monitoring contract from the dealer at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
we have not purchased any new security monitoring contracts since  although we do originate security equipment leases that include monitoring 
our service contract portfolio has represented a less significant portion of our revenue stream over time 
critical accounting policies we consider certain of our accounting policies to be the most critical to our financial condition and results of operations in the sense that they involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies as those policies related to revenue recognition  the allowance for credit losses  income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in our opinion  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  we may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interest is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
at the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to buy the equipment at the fair market value  return the equipment or continue to rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
if the lessee continues to rent the equipment  we record our investment in the rental contract at its estimated residual value 
rental revenue and depreciation are recognized based on the methodology described below 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees and service fees relating to the leases and contracts are recognized as they are earned 
our investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
our investment in rental contracts is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
rental income from monthly billings is recognized as the customer continues to rent the equipment 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of our investments in service and rental contracts 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses on our investment in leases  service contracts and rental contracts at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not have a formal credit review committee to review individual transactions 
rather  we developed a sophisticated  multi tiered pricing model and have automated the credit scoring  approval and collection processes 
we believe that with the proper pricing model  we can grant credit to a wide range of applicants provided we have priced appropriately for the associated risk 
as a result of approving a wide range of credits  we experience a relatively high level of delinquency and write offs in our portfolio 
we periodically review the credit scoring and approval process to ensure that the automated system is making appropriate credit decisions 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not evaluate transactions individually for the purpose of developing and determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
contracts in our portfolio are not re graded subsequent to the initial extension of credit and the allowance is not allocated to specific contracts 
rather  we view the contracts as having common characteristics and maintain a general allowance against our entire portfolio utilizing historical collection statistics and an assessment of current credit risk in the portfolio as the basis for the amount 
we have adopted a consistent  systematic procedure for establishing and maintaining an appropriate allowance for credit losses for our microticket transactions 
we estimate the likelihood of credit losses net of recoveries in the portfolio at each reporting period based upon a combination of the lessee s bureau reported credit score at lease inception and the current delinquency status of the account 
in addition to these elements  we also consider other relevant factors including general economic trends  trends in delinquencies and credit losses  static pool analysis of our portfolio  trends in recoveries made on charged off accounts  and other relevant factors which might affect the performance of our portfolio 
this combination of historical experience  credit scores  delinquency levels  trends in credit losses  and the review of current factors provide the basis for our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
we take charge offs against our receivables when such receivables are deemed uncollectible 
in general a receivable is uncollectable when it is days past due or earlier  if other adverse events occur with respect to an account 
historically  the typical monthly payment under our microticket leases has been small and as a result  our experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the relatively small amount necessary to bring an account current 

table of contents income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
in addition  our income tax calculations involve the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent management believes recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
in accordance with us gaap  uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are subject to potential financial statement recognition based on prescribed recognition and measurement criteria 
based on our evaluation  we concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our financial statements 
at december   there have been no material changes to the liability for uncertain tax positions and there are no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax positions to change significantly over the next twelve months 
share based compensation we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement of compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of asc topic and securities and exchange commission  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payments 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected option term  volatility of our stock  the risk free interest rate and our dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us under asc topic results of operations revenues change change in thousands income on financing leases rental income income on service contracts loss and damage waiver fees service fees and other interest income total revenues our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases and contracts  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 

table of contents total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from the year ended december  revenue from leases was million  up million from the previous year as a result of the increased originations 
rental income was million  down million from other revenue components contributed million  up million from the previous year in connection with the increased size in our portfolio  despite a decline in service contracts of  during the year 
the decline in rental income is primarily explained by attrition rates in the two sources of rental income 
one source is rental agreements that are originated and cancellable on a monthly basis 
we have not originated any new rental contracts since the other is the rental income that is recognized at the end of the lease term when a lessee chooses to keep the equipment and rents it on a monthly basis 
the decline in rental contracts is the result of attrition of leasecomm rental contracts which is partially offset by timepayment lease contracts coming to term and converting to rentals 
we have not funded any new service contracts since  therefore this segment of revenue continues to decline

rental income was million  down million from other revenue components contributed million  up million from the previous year in connection with the increased size in our portfolio  despite a decline in service contracts of  during the year

fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their expected useful lives 
certain rental contracts are originated as a result of the renewal provisions of our lease agreements where at the end of the lease term  the customer may elect to continue to rent the leased equipment on a month to month basis 
the rental equipment is recorded at its residual value and depreciated over a term of months 
this term represents the estimated life of a previously leased piece of equipment and is based upon our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed 
service contracts were recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated life of months 
in a typical service contract acquisition  a homeowner will purchase a home security system and simultaneously sign a contract with the security dealer for monthly monitoring of the system 
the security dealer would then sell the rights to that monthly payment to us 
we perform all of the processing  billing  collection and administrative work on the service contract 
the estimated life is based upon the expected life of such contracts in the security monitoring industry and our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month term  the remaining net book value is expensed 
we have not originated any new service contracts since depreciation expense on rentals increased by  or in connection with the timepayment rental portfolio  and amortization of service contracts decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the carrying value of our rental equipment increased from  at december  to  at december  the carrying value of our service contracts was at december  and december  depreciation on property and equipment increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation on property and equipment was primarily due to the abandonment of a proposed software platform and the related depreciation of costs capitalized in connection with that project 
depreciation expense on rentals increased by  or in connection with the increase in the timepayment rental portfolio  and amortization of service contracts decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the carrying value of our rental equipment increased from  at december  to  at december  the carrying value of our service contracts decreased from  at december  to at december  depreciation on property and equipment increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december

interest expense increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  at december   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million compared to million at december  the effect of higher average outstanding debt balances on our interest expense was partially offset by lower interest costs on our revolving line of credit 
interest expense increased by million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increased borrowings as well as higher rates of interest on our revolving line of credit 
at december   we had notes payable of million compared to notes payable of million at december  the interest rate on our revolving line of credit was at december  compared to at december  provision for income taxes change change in thousands provision for income taxes as a percent of revenue the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets  involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as leases  for tax and accounting purposes

we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent we believe recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the million increase in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the million decrease in income before income taxes and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of  due to the expiration of the statute of limitations of certain states

table of contents exposure to credit losses the amounts in the table below represent the balance of delinquent receivables on an exposure basis for all leases  rental contracts and service contracts in our portfolio as of december   and an exposure basis aging classifies the entire receivable based on the invoice that is the most delinquent 
for example  in the case of a rental or service contract  if a receivable is days past due  all amounts billed and unpaid are placed in the over days past due category 
in the case of lease receivables  where the minimum contractual obligation of the lessee is booked as a receivable at the inception of the lease  if a receivable is days past due  the entire receivable  including all amounts billed and unpaid as well as the minimum contractual obligation yet to be billed  will be placed in the over days past due category 
december  december  december  dollars in thousands current days past due days past due over days past due receivables due in installments liquidity and capital resources general our lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund lease originations 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities  on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt  free cash flow and the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february we will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand our funding of leases and contracts  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in the near term  we expect to finance our business utilizing cash from operations  cash on hand and our revolving line of credit which matures in august additionally  our uses of cash include the payment of interest and principal on borrowings  selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes  payment of dividends  and capital expenditures 
we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investing activities primarily relate to the origination of leases with investments in lease contracts  direct costs  property  and equipment

in addition  we paid dividends of million in each of  and we believe that cash flows from our existing portfolio  cash on hand  available borrowings on the existing credit facility which matures august  and additional financing as required will be sufficient to support our operations and lease origination activity in the near term 

table of contents borrowings we utilize our revolving line of credit to fund the origination and acquisition of leases 
borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit consist of the following december  december  maximum maximum amounts interest unused facility amounts interest unused facility outstanding rate capacity amount outstanding rate capacity amount dollars in revolving credit facility the unused capacity is subject to limitations based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula 
on august   we entered into a three year revolving line of credit with a bank syndicate led by sovereign bank sovereign based on qualified timepayment lease receivables 
the total commitment under the facility was originally million  and was subsequently increased to million in july  to million in february  and most recently to million in connection with a july  amendment 
outstanding borrowings are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets 
prior to the july amendment  outstanding borrowings bore interest at prime plus or at a london interbank offered rate libor plus  in each case subject to a minimum rate of 
following the july amendment  outstanding borrowings bear interest at prime plus or libor plus  without being subject to any minimum rate 
under the terms of the facility  loans are prime rate loans  unless we elect libor loans 
if a libor loan is not renewed at maturity it automatically converts to a prime rate loan 
as a part of the july amendment  the maturity date of the facility was extended to august  at our option upon maturity  the unpaid principal balance may be converted to a six month term loan 
at december  million of our loans were libor loans and million of our loans were prime rate loans 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit was between and at december  as of december  the qualified lease receivables eligible under the borrowing base exceeded the million revolving line of credit 
financial covenants our sovereign revolving line of credit  like our prior facilities  has financial covenants that we must comply with in order to obtain funding through the facility and to avoid an event of default 
these include requirements that we i maintain a ratio of our consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes and non recurring non cash items  as calculated under the agreement  to our consolidated interest expense of not less than as of the end of any fiscal quarter  ii maintain consolidated tangible capital base defined to mean our consolidated tangible net worth  as calculated under the agreement  plus subordinated debt at minimum levels  which are increased from quarter to quarter in relation to our net income and any equity capital we receive  iii maintain a leverage ratio defined to mean the ratio of consolidated total liabilities  less subordinated debt  to consolidated tangible net worth  plus subordinated debt at any time to exceed to  and iv not permit the amount of receivables over days past due to exceed of gross lease installments 
the revolving line of credit also contains other affirmative and negative covenants  including a restriction on our ability to incur or guaranty indebtedness  dispose of or acquire assets or engage in a merger transaction  or make certain restricted payments 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our borrowing relationships 

table of contents contractual obligations and lease commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due payments payments payments less than due due due after contractual obligations total year years years years revolving line of credit operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total contractual obligations we have entered into various agreements  such as debt and operating lease agreements that require future payments 
during the year ended december  we had net borrowings of million against our revolving line of credit 
the million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of december  will be repaid by the daily application of timepayment receipts to our outstanding balance 
our future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
our future minimum lease payments under capital leases are  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
lease commitments we accept lease applications on daily basis and have a pipeline of applications that have been approved  where a lease has not been originated 
our commitment to lend does not become binding until all of the steps in the lease origination process have been completed  including but not limited to the receipt of a complete and accurate lease document  all required supporting information and successful verification with the lessee 
since we fund on the same day a lease is successfully verified  we have no firm outstanding commitments to lend 
market risk and financial instruments the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
the implicit yield on all of our leases and contracts is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases and contracts having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination 
when we originate or acquire leases or contracts  we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit yield on each lease or contract and the effective interest rate we expect to incur in financing such lease or contract through our credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease or contract could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
given the relatively short average life of our leases and contracts  our goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations which limits our interest rate risk 
as of december   we have repaid all of our fixed rate debt and have million of outstanding variable interest rate obligations under our sovereign revolving line of credit 
our sovereign line of credit bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the prime or the libor  therefore  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on our interest expense would be immaterial 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
the primary objectives of the investment guidelines are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs  and to maximize return 
we minimize investment risk by limiting the amount invested in any single security 
table of contents and by focusing on conservative investment choices with short terms and high credit quality standards 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or invest for speculative trading purposes 
investment activity in and was very limited given the lack of cash on hand to invest and the relatively low investment rates being offered 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  codified as fasb accounting standard codification asc transfers and servicing 
this topic requires entities to provide more information regarding sales of securitized financial assets and similar transactions  particularly if the entity has continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
fasb asc eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures 
fasb asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  on january  we adopted the new content of fasb asc which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas  codified as fasb asc consolidation 
this topic modifies how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
fasb asc clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
fasb asc requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
fasb asc also requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
fasb asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  on january  we adopted the new content of fasb asc which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides amendments to fasb fair value measurements and disclosures that require new disclosures as follows transfers in and out of levels and a reporting entry should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
activity in level fair value measurements a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted the provisions of asu which are required for the current year and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the provisions of asu which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  are not expected to have a material impact on our future financial statements
