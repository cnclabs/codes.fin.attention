item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors 

table of contents overview we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of standby generators for the residential  industrial and commercial markets 
as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products  we have one of the leading market positions in the standby generator market in the united states and canada 
we design  engineer and manufacture generators with an output of between w and mw of power 
we design  manufacture  source and modify engines  alternators  automatic transfer switches and other components necessary for our products 
our generators are fueled by natural gas  liquid propane  gasoline  diesel and bi fuel 
our products are available through a broad network of independent dealers  retailers and wholesalers 
business drivers and measures in operating our business and monitoring its performance  we pay attention to a number of industry trends  performance measures and operational factors 
the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 
industry trends our performance is affected by the demand for reliable back up power solutions by our customer base 
this demand is influenced by several important trends affecting our industry  including the following increasing penetration opportunity 
although there have been recent increases in product costs for installed standby generators in the residential and light commercial markets driven in the last two years by raw material costs  these costs have declined overall over the last decade  and many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of backup power solutions 
we estimate that penetration rates for residential products are approximately of us single family detached  owner occupied households with a home value of over  as defined by the us census bureau american housing survey for the united states  and penetration rates of many light commercial outlets such as restaurants  drug stores  and gas stations are significantl y lower than penetration of hospitals and industrial locations 
we believe that by expanding our distribution network  continuing to develop our product line  and targeting our marketing efforts  we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 
impact of residential investment cycle 
the market for residential generators is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer sentiment 
when homeowners are confident of their household income or net worth  they are more likely to invest in their home 
these trends can have a material impact on demand for residential generators 
effect of large scale power disruptions 
power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators 
disruptions in the aging us power grid and tropical and winter storm activity increase product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period  which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators 
while there are power outages every year across all regions of the country  major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and  as a result  our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 
impact of business capital investment cycle 
the market for commercial and industrial generators is affected by the capital investment cycle and overall durable goods spending  as businesses either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations 
these trends can have a material impact on demand for industrial and commercial generators 
however the capital investment cycle may differ for the various industrial and commercial end markets industrial  telecommunications  distribution  retail health care facilities and municipal infrastructure  among others 
the market for generators is also affected by general economic conditions  credit availability and trends in durable goods spending by consumers and businesses 
operational factors we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations  which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control  including continued product development  expanded distribution  pricing and cost control 
the operational factors that affect our business include the following new product start up costs 
when we launch new products  we generally experience an increase in start up costs  including engineering expenses  air freight expenses  testing expenses and marketing expenses  resulting in lower gross margins after the initial launch of a new product 
margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as these start up costs decline and we focus our engineering efforts on product cost reduction 

table of contents effect of commodity  currency and component price fluctuations 
industry wide price fluctuations of key commodities  such as steel  copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products  together with foreign currency fluctuations  can have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity  currency and component prices through improved product design  price increases and select hedging transactions 
our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates  which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 
other factors other factors that affect our results of operations include the following factors influencing interest and amortization expense 
as a result of the ccmp transactions in  our interest expense and amortization expense increased 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements prior to november are not comparable to subsequent periods  primarily as a result of significantly increased interest expense and amortization expense 
interest expense decreased in because we repaid million of outstanding indebtedness during  interest rates declined from levels and certain interest rate swap contracts terminated at the beginning of factors influencing provision for income taxes 
because we made a section h election in connection with the ccmp transactions  we have billion of tax deductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december  that we expect to generate cash tax savings of million through  assuming continued profitability and a tax rate 
the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be million annually through and million in  which generates annual cash tax savings of million through and million in  assuming profitability and a tax rate 
additiona lly  we have federal net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards of million as of december   which we expect to generate an additional million of federal cash tax savings at a rate when and if utilized 
based on current business plans  we believe that our cash tax obligations through will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes 
however  any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section of the us internal revenue code of  including through sales of stock by large stockholders  all of which are outside of our control  could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 
seasonality 
although there is demand for our products throughout the year  in each of the past three years approximately to of our net sales occurred in the first quarter  to in the second quarter  to in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter  with different seasonality depending on the timing of outage activity in each year 
we maintain a flexible production schedule in order to respond to outage driven peak demand  but typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 
transactions with ccmp in november  affiliates of ccmp  together with affiliates of unitas and members of our management  purchased an aggregate of million of our equity capital 
in addition  on november   generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of  million  consisting of an initial drawdown of million under a billion first lien secured credit facility and million under a million second lien secured credit facility 
with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings  together with cash on hand at generac power systems  we acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pre transaction indebtedness of generac power systems for billion  paid million in transaction costs related to the transaction and r etained million for general corporate purposes 
for additional information concerning these and other historical transactions with ccmp  see item business history ccmp transactions 
during  affiliates of ccmp acquired million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately million 
ccmp affiliates exchanged this debt for additional shares of class b common stock 
the fair value of the shares exchanged was million 
we recorded this transaction as additional class b common stock of million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmp affiliates  which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged 
the debt was held in treasury at face value 
consequently  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  which includes the write off of deferred financing fees and other closing costs  in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december

consequently  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  which includes a write off of deferred financing fees and other closing costs  in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in connection with such issuances of our class b common stock to affiliates of ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in and and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances  affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of our class b common stock they were issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp  certain affiliates of unitas and certain members of our management and board of directors 
in addition  in connection with such issuances of our series a preferred stock to affiliates and ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in and and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances  during the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock f or an aggregate purchase price of million in cash to an entity affiliated with ccmp and certain members of management and our board of directors  and affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of series a preferred stock they were previously issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp and a member of the board of directors at the same price 
corporate reorganization our capitalization prior to the initial public offering consisted of series a preferred stock  class b common stock and class a common stock 
our series a preferred stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares and equity participation equal to of the remaining equity value of the company 
our class b common stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares 
in connection with the initial public offering  we undertook a corporate reorganization which gave effect to the conversion of our series a preferred stock and class b common stock into the same class of our common stock that was sold in our initial public offering while taking into account the rights and preference of those shares  including the priority returns of our series a preferred stock and our class b common stock and the equity participation rights of the series a preferred stock 
a reverse stock split was needed to reduce the number of shares to be issued to holders of our class a and class b common stock to the number that correctly reflected the proportionate interest of such stockholders in our company  taking into account the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of our series a preferred stock and the number and value of shares of common stock to be issued and sold to new investors in the initial public offering 
we refer to these transactions as the corporate reorganization 
the specific steps in the corporate reorganization were as follows treatment of class b common stock our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering provided for the mandatory conversion of our class b voting common stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering  so that our class b common stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value  rights and preferences of our class b common stock 
in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering  at the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering  each share of our class b common stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to one plus the quotient obtained by dividing i x the amount paid for such share of class b common stock plus y an in crease to such amount equal to per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a day year of twelve day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis ie  the class b return  by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
we refer to this as the class b conversion 
each share of our class b common stock converted into  shares of our class a common stock ie  the class b conversion ratio 
as a result of the class b conversion  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock 

table of contents reverse stock split immediately following the class b conversion  we effected a for one reverse stock split of our then outstanding shares of class a common stock  including those shares of our class a common stock issued as part of the class b conversion  which decreased the number of shares of our class a common stock immediately after the class b conversion from  shares to  shares 
we refer to this as the reverse stock split 
treatment of series a preferred stock the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prior to our initial public offering provided for the mandatory conversion of the series a preferred stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering  so that our series a preferred stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value  rights and preferences of our series a preferred stock 
in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations to our series a preferred stock and our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering  promptly following the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering  each share of our series a preferred stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a c ommon stock equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing i w the amount paid for such share of series a preferred stock plus x an increase to such amount equal to per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a day year of twelve day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis the series a preferred return  by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions  plus b the product of y a fraction  the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our series a preferred stock outstanding at such time  and z an additional number of shares of our class a common stock that  when added to the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time  including after giving effect to the class b conversion and the reverse stock split  equaled of the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time excluding t he shares issued pursuant to clause a above 
we refer to this as the series a preferred conversion 
each share of our series a preferred stock converted into  shares of our class a common stock ie  the series a preferred conversion ratio 
as a result of the series a preferred conversion  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock 
reclassification of class a common stock after giving effect to the class b conversion  the reverse stock split and the series a preferred conversion  there were  shares of class a common stock which were reclassified as common stock 
initial public offering on february   the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
in addition  the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional  shares of the company s common stock from the company on march  we received a total of approximately million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters option exercise  after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses 
immediately following the corporate reorganization  the ipo and underwriters option exercise  we had  total shares of common stock outstanding 
repayment of debt in february  we used million in net proceeds from the initial closing of the ipo to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan 
in addition  in march and december  we used million and million respectively  of cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan 
as a result of these debt repayments  the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to million as of december   and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated 
this reduction in debt will have a significant impact on cash flows as a result of lower interest expense in future periods  based on current libor rates 

table of contents components of net sales and expenses net sales substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our standby generators to the residential  commercial and industrial markets 
we also sell air cooled engines to certain customers and sell service parts to our dealer network 
net sales are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
net sales also includes shipping and handling charges billed to customers which are recognized at the time of shipment of products to our customers 
related freight costs are included in cost of sales 
our generators are fueled by natural gas  liquid propane  gasoline  diesel or bi fuel systems with power output from w to mw 
our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets across the united states and canada 
our smaller kw generators for th e residential  portable and commercial markets are typically built to stock  while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 
our net sales are affected primarily by the us economy as sales outside of north america represent only approximately of total net sales 
we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales  with no single customer representing more than of our net sales for the year ended december  and our top ten customers representing less than of our net sales for the same period 
costs of goods sold the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts  raw materials  factory overhead and labor 
component parts and raw materials comprised over of costs of goods sold for the year ended december  the principal component parts are engines and alternators 
we design and manufacture air cooled engines for certain of our products smaller than kw 
we source engines for some of our smaller products and all of our products larger than kw 
we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units 
we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage 
we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable  low cost suppliers 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel  copper and aluminum 
we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities  impacting our costs of goods sold 
we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on product design improvements and price increases in our products 
however  there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 
other sources of costs include our manufacturing facilities  which require significant factory overhead  labor and shipping costs 
factory overhead includes utilities  support personnel  depreciation  general supplies and support and maintenance 
although we maintain a low cost  largely non union workforce and flexible manufacturing processes  our margins can be impacted when we cannot promptly decrease labor and manufacturing costs to match declines in net sales 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our marketing  distribution  engineering  information systems  human resources  finance  purchasing  risk management  legal and tax functions 
all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries  bonuses  employee benefit costs and taxes 
we classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service  research and development  general and administrative  and amortization of intangibles 
selling and service 
our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense  marketing expense  warranty expense and other sales expenses 
our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our national accounts and other personnel involved in the marketing and sales of our products 
warranty expense  which is recorded at the time of sale  is estimated based on historical trends 
our marketing expenses include direct mail costs  printed material costs  product display costs  market research expenses  trade show expenses and media advertising 
marketing expenses generally increase as our sales efforts increase and are related to the launch of new product offerings and opportun ities within selected markets or associated with specific events such as awareness marketing in areas impacted by storms  participation in trade shows and other events 

table of contents research and development 
our research and development expenses support over active research and development projects 
we currently operate three advanced facilities and employ close to engineers who focus on new product development  existing product improvement and cost reduction 
our commitment to research and development has resulted in a significant portfolio of approximately us and international patents and patent applications 
our research and development is expensed as incurred 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees  accounting and legal professional services fees  information technology costs  insurance  travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expense 
in  our general and administrative expenses have increased as we have incurred additional expenses associated with being a public company  including increased personnel costs  legal costs  accounting costs  board compensation expense  investor relations costs  higher insurance premiums  stock based compensation expense  and costs associated with our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  other applicable sec regulations and the requirements of th e nyse 
amortization of intangibles 
our amortization of intangibles expenses include the straight line amortization of customer lists  patents and other intangibles assets 
goodwill and trade name impairment charges 
goodwill primarily represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire us over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the november date of the ccmp transactions 
other indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
the fair value of trade names is measured using a relief from royalty approach  which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 
in some periods  we have recorded a charge for the write down of goodwill and trade names that was recorded in operating expenses 
please see critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets for additional detail on this charge 
transaction related expenses 
in the year ended december   our operating expenses include one time transaction related expenses incurred during the predecessor period related to the ccmp transactions 
other income expense our other income expense includes the interest expense on the outstanding balances of our million first lien term loan  million second lien term loan and million revolving credit facility entered into in november  and the amortization of debt financing costs 
in february  we used the net proceeds from the initial closing of the initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan 
in addition  in march and december  we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan principal 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  and december  the amounts borrowed under our term loans bear interest at rates based upon either a base rate or libor  plus an applicable margin 
we also earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents  which is included in other income expense 
we also recorded expenses related to interest rate swap agreements  which had a notional amount of million outstanding at december  at an average rate of  and a notional amount of million outstanding at december  at an average rate of 
other income expense may also include other financial items such as extinguishment of debt 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales costs of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and service research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income from operations total other expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  dollars in thousands residential power products industrial commercial power products other net sales net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a million  or a  increase in sales to the residential markets due to continued expansion of the company s distribution network and successful new product launches  offset by continued weakness in us residential investment 
this residential product sales increase was offset by a million  or  decline in industrial and commercial product sales as a result of market declines in non residential construction and reduced capital spending by national account customers 
although a decrease for the full year  industrial and commercial produc t sales displayed strong momentum in the second half of fiscal as end markets recovered 
other product sales increased million as a result of stronger rv  oem engine and service parts sales 
costs of goods sold 
costs of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a million increase in materials cost  primarily due to higher steel  copper and aluminum costs  as well as by the increase in sales volume  partially offset by lower manufacturing overhead costs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to incremental research and development costs of million related to ongoing product development 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased million  of which million is related to non cash stock compensation expense recorded for the time vesting of equity awards granted in connection with the ipo 
the remaining increase in administrative costs is associated with additional costs to operate as a public company 

table of contents other expense 
other expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was driven by a decline in interest expense of million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness  lower libor rates and the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements 
offsetting this interest expense decline in  there was a prior year gain on extinguishment of debt of million that did not occur in  as well as the current year write off of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishment of million 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   unchanged from the year ended december  income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 
net income 
as a result of the factors identified above  we generated net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda decreased to million  compared to million in  as modest sales growth and consistent gross margins were more than offset by increased investment in the business 
adjusted ebitda margins declined slightly in fiscal to compared to in fiscal adjusted net income 
adjusted net income increased to million in compared to million in the increase in adjusted net income was attributable to lower interest expense versus prior year offset by non cash stock compensation expenses and reduced adjusted ebitda compared to fiscal year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales costs of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and service research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles goodwill and trade name impairment charges total operating expenses income loss from operations total other expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss year ended december  dollars in thousands residential power products industrial commercial power products other net sales net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a million  or  increase in sales to the residential markets due to the introduction of our new automatic home standby generator products  increases in our points of distribution  our re entry into the small kilowatt portable generator market in may  and a strong winter storm season in the beginning of  partially offset by a weaker summer storm season during the third quarter of the increase in home standby and portable generators was partially offset by a million  or  decline in industrial and commercial sales as industrial national account and other c ustomers lowered capital spending in late and net sales were also impacted by increased selling prices on certain residential  commercial and industrial units 

table of contents costs of goods sold 
costs of goods sold decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was driven by a million decrease in materials cost  primarily due to lower steel  copper and aluminum costs  partially offset by the increase in sales volume 
freight costs and labor overhead costs also decreased million and million  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  gross profit margin increased as we realized the margin improvement from price increases  commodity normalization and improved sourcing of certain components and products  partially offset by higher sales of lower margin products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  because of the goodwill and tradename impairment  operating expenses were million higher for the year ended december  the remaining increase in operating expenses of million in was driven by an increase in amortization of intangibles of million  primarily due to the re characterization of a particular trade name from indefinite lived to defined life 
the impairment of the particular trade name was a result of the implementation of our re branding strategy  whereby we consolidated brands under the generac label and have begun phasing out the particular trade name over time 
selli ng and service expenses also increased million due to higher variable expenses related to our increase in net sales  such as warranty  commission and credit card fees  as well as higher advertising costs 
research and development expenses increased million from ongoing product development and engineering resource investment 
general and administrative expenses declined million due to cost containment initiatives across the business 
other expense 
other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a decrease in gains on the extinguishment of debt of million  partially offset by a decline in interest expense of million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness and lower libor rates 
the gains on extinguishment of debt and the related decrease in interest expense are due to the debt repurchases by affiliates of ccmp  which were subsequently contributed to our company in exchange for shares of our class b voting common stock and series a preferred stock 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   a decline of million from million for the year ended december  income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 
net income loss 
as a result of the factors identified above  we generated net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the increase in income from operations previously discussed excluding the impact of the goodwill and tradename impairment charge in which is excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda 
adjusted net income 
adjusted net income increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the increase in income from operations previously discussed excluding the impact of the goodwill and tradename impairment charge in which is excluded from the calculation of adjusted net income  as well as the reduction in interest expense previously discussed 
liquidity and financial position our primary cash requirements include the payment of our raw material and components suppliers  salaries benefits  operating expenses  interest and principal payments on our debt  and capital expenditures 
we finance our operations primarily through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in november  generac power systems entered into a seven year million first lien term loan  a seven and a half year million second lien term loan  and a six year million revolving credit facility 
on february   we used approximately million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loans 
in march and december  we used a substa ntial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand to repay an additional million and million  respectively  of our first lien term loan 
as a result of these pay downs  the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to million as of december   and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated 

table of contents at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
our total indebtedness was million at december  long term liquidity we believe that our cash flow from operations  our availability under our revolving credit facility  combined with our low capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes  will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the next twelve months and beyond 
however  even with our reduced leverage  we will use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt  limiting the amount available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
as we continue to expand our business  we may in the future require additional capital to fund working capital  capital expenditures  or acquisitions 
cash flow year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in thousands change change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million in this increase of million represents a increase over prior year mainly due to the reduction of cash paid for interest expense of million

senior secured credit facilities in november  as part of the ccmp transactions  generac power systems entered into i a first lien credit facility with goldman sachs credit partners lp  as administrative agent  composed of x a million term loan  which matures in november and y a million revolving credit facility  which matures in november  and ii a second lien credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  composed of a million term loan  which matures in may a summary of these senior secured credit facilities are described below 
on february   we used approximately million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loans 
in march and december  we used a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand to repay an additional million and million  respectively  of our first lien term loan 
as a result of these pay downs  at december  the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility had been reduced to million  and our second lien credit facility had been repaid in full and terminated 
the first lien credit facility bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate  plus an applicable margin as of december   as of december  and as of december  or adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin as of december   as of december  and as of december  determined based on a leverage ratio 
the effective interest rate on the first lien credit facility term loan on december  was 
the effective interest rate  excluding the effect of interest rate swaps in place on the first lien credit facility term loan  was the second lien credit facility  which was paid in full on february   bore interest at rates based upon a base rate  plus an applicable margin of  or an adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin of 
amounts under the revolving credit facility can be borrowed and repaid  from time to time  at our option  provided there is no default or event of default under either credit facility 
the obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by generac acquisition corp 
the first lien term loan facility and the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest subject to permitted liens in substantially all tangible and intangible assets subject to certain exceptions owned by generac acquisition corp 
and generac power systems  the capital stock of the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of generac acquisition corp

the second lien term loan facility was secured by a second priority security interest in all the assets pledged to the first lien term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  as described above 
in addition  our senior secured credit facilities provide us the option to raise incremental credit facilities  subject to certain limitations 

table of contents covenant compliance the senior secured credit facility requires generac power systems to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total debt  net of unrestricted cash and marketable securities  to ebitda as defined in the senior secured credit facility 
we refer to the calculation of ebitda under and as defined in our senior secured credit facility in this annual report as covenant ebitda 
covenant ebitda and the leverage ratio are calculated based on the four most recently completed fiscal quarters of generac power systems 
based on the formulations set forth in the first lien credit facility  as of december   generac power systems was required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of to 
the maximum leverage ratio decreases over time 
the first lien credit facility required generac power systems to have a leverage ratio of no greater than to in the fourth quarter of  and requires a leverage ratio of no greater than to in the first quarter of  to in the second quarter of  to in the third quarter of  to in the fourth quarter of and thereafter 
as of december   generac power systems leverage ratio was to 
failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facility unless waived by our lenders 
as of september   generac power systems had violated its leverage ratio covenant 
as permitted by the senior secured credit facilities  this violation was remedied by an equity contribution of million from affiliates of ccmp in the fourth quarter of generac power systems was in compliance with all of its covenants as of december   december  and december  the maximum leverage ratio is a material term of our senior secured credit facility in part because it is a maintenance covenant  and our compliance with the covenant is used in determining  among other things  the interest rate of the first lien credit facility  our ability to undertake business acquisitions  our ability to incur certain types of indebtedness and the maximum amount of dividends and distributions that our senior secured credit facilities permit us to pay to our stockholders  as described in more detail below 
the senior secured credit facility contains other events of default that are customary for similar facilities and transactions  including a cross default provision with respect to any other indebtedness in an outstanding aggregate principal amount in excess of million 
an event of default under the senior secured credit facility could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the facility  and we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due 
if there were an event of default as a result of a failure to maintain our required leverage ratio or otherwise  it would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity  including preventing us from utilizing our revolving credit facility 
in addition  the senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to take certain actions  such as incur additional debt or make certain acquisitions  if we are unable to meet our leverage ratio 
in addition to the financial covenant described above  the senior secured credit facility contains certain other affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  provide limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens on property  sale and leaseback transactions  investments  loans and advances  merger or consolidation  asset sales  acquisitions  transactions with affiliates  prepayments of any other indebtedness  modifications of generac power systems organizational documents  restrictions on generac power systems subsidiaries ability to make capital expenditures

any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on november  the principal amount of the second lien term loan facility was due on may   but was paid in full on february  with the proceeds from the ipo 

table of contents both the first lien and second lien credit facility grant generac power systems the option to prepay its borrowings under the term loans or the revolving credit facility  subject to the procedures set forth in the credit documents 
in certain circumstances  generac power systems may be required to make prepayments on its borrowings if it receives proceeds as a result of certain asset sales  debt issuances  casualty or similar events of loss or if generac power systems has excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facilities 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the first lien term loan 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the first lien term loan and million of borrowings were outstanding under the second lien term loan 
as previously disclosed  on february   we used approximately million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loans 
in march and december  we used a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand to repay an additional million and million respectively  of our first lien term loan 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including current portion interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity and using the interest rates in effect for our senior secured credit facilities as of december  pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment due to the inherent assumptions underlying the obligation 
however  the company estimates we will contribute million to our pension plans in capital expenditures our operations require capital expenditures for technology  tooling  equipment  capacity expansion and upgrades 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   and were funded through cash from operations 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   and were funded through cash from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers 
this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company 
we receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider 
if our dealers do not pay the finance company  we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer 
total inventory financed accounted for approximately of net sales for the year ended december  and approximately of net sales for the year ended december  the amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  and prepaid expenses 
management believes the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment assessment  defined benefit pension obligations  estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory reserves  product warranty  other contingencies  derivative accounting  income taxes  and share based compensation 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit 
we have determined we have one reporting unit  and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker 
estimated fair value is based on management judgments and assumptions with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  and those fair values are compared with our aggregate carr ying value 
if our fair value is greater than the carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if our carrying amount is greater than the fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill  which is compared to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value  assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
our fair value was estimated based on a weighted analysis of discounted cash flows and comparable public company analysis ie  market approach 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
due to an increase in the our weighted average cost of capital and lower comparable public company market values resulting from weakening economic conditions  the analysis indicated the potential for impairment 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation with the assistance of a third party valuation firm and determined an impairment of goodwill existed 
accordingly  a non cash charge of million was recognized in for goodwill impairment 
we performed our annual fair value based impairment test on trade names as of october  as a result of the test  we recorded a non cash charge of million for trade name impairment 
the primary reason for this impairment charge related to a re branding strategy  which was committed to in the fourth quarter of and resulted in our plan to discontinue use of the guardian trade name over time as we consolidate brands under the generac label 
accordingly  this particular trade name was written down to its estimated realizable value of million  which will be amortized over its remaining useful life of two years 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which indicated a premium over net book value of 
the testing determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
in addition  we performed our annual fair value based impairment test on trade names as of october  the testing determined that there was no impairment of our trade names at that time 
as of october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which indicated a premium over net book value of 
the testing determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
in addition  we performed our annual fair value based impairment test on trade names as of october  the testing determined that there was no impairment of our trade names at that time 
we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or trade names will not be impaired in the future 
when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis  we make a number of key estimates and assumptions 
we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs 
this  in turn  involves further estimates  such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates 
in addition  we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation 
this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year 
weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures  market betas  risk free rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 
changes in these key est imates and assumptions  or in other assumptions used in this process  could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 
additionally  since our measurement also considers a market approach  changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

table of contents in the long term  our remaining goodwill and trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed 
these factors include a prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in the demand for our products  the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors 
if management estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
defined benefit pension obligations the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
as discussed in note  the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc  defined benefit plans pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations for fiscal year used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we study historical markets and preserve the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasona bleness and appropriateness 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations 
given this policy  we expect to make million in contributions to our pension plans in allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory reserves  product warranty reserves and other contingencies the reserves  if any  for customer rebates  product warranty  product liability  litigation  excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
these reserves are reflected under notes   and to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents derivative accounting we have interest rate swap contracts  or the swaps  in place to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness 
for and  the swaps were deemed highly effective per asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and therefore  any changes in fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of january   in accordance with the terms of our senior secured credit facilities  we changed the interest rate election from three month libor to one month libor 
as a result  we concluded that as of january   the swaps no longer met hedge effectiveness criteria under sfas no 
future changes in the fair value of the swaps was immediately recognized in our statement of operations as interest expense  while the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change remained in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and was amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which ended on january  new interest rate swap contracts entered into in fiscal are deemed highly effective per asc as required by asc derivatives and hedging  we record the swaps at fair value pursuant to asc fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value 
when determining the fair value of the swaps  we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc the fair value of the swaps  including the impact of credit risk  at december  and was a liability of million and million  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes 
our estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as significant net operating loss carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
however  the company is currently in a three year cumulative net loss position  due primarily to a goodwill and tradename impairment write off in  and th erefore has not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of the deferred tax assets as of december  as a result of this analysis  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets 
share based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
new accounting standards there are currently no significant new accounting standards to be adopted by the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  we use financial instruments from time to time 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries 
periodically  we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business 
contracts typically have maturities of one year or less 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold 
at december  and december   we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
on february   we entered into a ten month foreign currency average rate option transaction for euros with a total notional amount of million and a termination date of december  total losses recognized in the statement of operations for foreign currency contracts were  the primary objective of this hedging activity is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of the euro on our financial results 
commodity prices we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities  including steel  aluminum  copper and others 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process 
depending on the supplier  these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
periodically  we engage in certain commodity risk management activities 
the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results 
generally  these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 
we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less 
these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases 
at december   there was one outstanding commodity contract in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases 
total gains recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were  for the year ended december  on november   we entered into a four month commodity hedge transaction for copper with a total notional amount of million with an effective date of january  the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of copper on our financial results 
at december   this contract was the only outstanding commodity contract in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases 
total gains recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were  for the year ended december  interest rates as of december   a portion of the outstanding debt under our term loans was subject to floating interest rate risk 
we previously entered into interest rate swaps with certain banks 
the notional amount of these swaps was million as of december  these swaps expired on january  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a certain bank on january  the effective date of the swap was july  with a notional amount of  a fixed rate of and an expiration date of july  on june   we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a certain bank 
the effective date of the swap was october  with a notional amount of  a fixed rate of and an expiration date of october  at december   the fair value of the swaps reduced for our credit risk and excluding related accrued interest was a liability of million 
for further information on these swaps  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
even after giving effect to these swaps  we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by these swaps 
a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately million or  without the swaps in place  million 
we expect to maintain our existing swaps as highly effective in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and  therefore  any changes in the fair value of the swap would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
