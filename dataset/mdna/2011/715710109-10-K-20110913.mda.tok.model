executive overview our business pervasive is a global data innovation leader  delivering software to manage  integrate and analyze data  in the cloud or on premises  throughout the entire data lifecycle 
our pervasive psql database products generated approximately of our revenue during fiscal year channel adoption trends for version of our pervasive psql database have been good since its launch in september pervasive psql v delivers improvements in performance and increased simplicity of development  deployment and ease of use  including enhanced digital license management and enhanced support for ipv and multi core technologies 
we also plan a release in autumn of pervasive psql vx  with improved support and pricing for use in virtual environments 
our integration products generated approximately of our revenue during fiscal year and are well received by our existing and new customers  including end users and commercial cloud and on premises software developers alike 
our solid results in both of our core product lines allow us to continue to fund our commitment to innovation 
we intend to continue to invest in innovation by allocating dedicated funds for research focused on new ways to serve our existing customers and attract new customers 
our innovation efforts in fiscal years  and have resulted in the introduction and further development of various new product and service offerings pervasive datasolutions subscription based integration as a service delivered on premises or as a multi tenant service hosted by pervasive and in a growing number of cases by our isv and si partners  pervasive datarush a software development platform that lets developers rapidly build parallel applications that deliver high throughput on big data  it fully leverages the parallel processing capabilities of multicore processors to deliver unmatched performance on a multicore server  smp machine  cluster or hadoop cluster  
table of contents pervasive datacloud a secure and reliable on demand services platform for pervasive or partner cloud developers who need to rapidly create high level or low level on demand data and application integration  on demand analytics  and on demand data profiling  and perasive webdi cloud based bb document exchange services that enable companies to send and receive business information in a seamless  timely and secure manner regardless of their enterprise system  during fiscal  we completed migration of the webdi customer base to the newest product release and to the microsoft windows azure cloud platform for enhanced scalability and stability 
for more than twenty five years  pervasive products have delivered value to tens of thousands of customers worldwide  often embedded within partners software  with breakthrough performance  flexibility  reliability and return on investment 
in addition  significant portions of our database and integration flagship product lines are embeddable into commercial applications for sale predominantly through a well developed channel of independent software vendors isvs  software as a service saas vendors  value added resellers vars and system integrators 
on july   we completed the purchase of assets from greenville  sc based channelinx  inc  a web based electronic data interchange web di technology company  for total consideration of approximately million in cash 
the acquired business  which operates as pervasive business xchange  is complementary to the company s other products and operations 
we develop  market  sell and support our offerings worldwide through our principal office in austin  texas and our greenville  south carolina office and through international offices in brussels  frankfurt  paris and london and a joint venture in japan 
our operating results our comparative results for the fiscal year ended june  revenue was million and million in the fiscal years ending june  and  respectively 
the company closed two relatively large transactions with database customers representing approximately million in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and approximately million in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year net income was million and million in the fiscal years ending june  and  respectively 
we continued to generate positive cash flow from operations with million and million in the fiscal years ending june  and  respectively 
we ended fiscal year with million in cash and marketable securities 
we acquired approximately million shares of our common stock  at a cost of approximately million in the fiscal year ending june  issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of june  totaled approximately million 
market trends we believe that the software markets as a whole are going through rapid change 
the emergence of cloud based infrastructure and applications is testament to the increasing demand for the scalability and rapid deployment provided by the saas delivery model 
organizations increasingly demand software that provides ease of use  re usability  interoperability with widely adopted technologies  the flexibility to be deployed on premises or in the cloud  and cost effective maintenance 
in this environment  delivering flexibility and performance with high return on investment becomes increasingly critical 
as these market disruption trends continue  we believe infrastructure software will be a key ingredient for all businesses as they seek to integrate and streamline their back end systems and eliminate delays in the management and execution of critical processes 
infrastructure software includes  among other things  application development tools  integration tools and solutions  analytics  databases  and security solutions 

table of contents in addition  the rapid proliferation of commodity multicore hardware  along with exploding data volumes  provides opportunities for companies to leverage affordable servers and clusters of servers that have multiple cores in a single box to extract value from large volumes of data but only if they have software that can effectively scale on multiple cores 
the inevitable performance gains traditionally delivered by faster processors under moore s law now must rely on a new generation of infrastructure software that can scale on ever updating multicore hardware platforms 
pervasive also continues to see consolidation in markets where its data management and data integration offerings compete 
in the database arena  oracle acquired the open source sun mysql database while sap acquired sybase 
for isvs who want to avoid vendor lock in with monolithic industry giants  pervasive psql remains an attractive alternative 
in the data integration market  ibm acquired castiron systems and dell acquired boomi  resulting in pervasive being one of an increasingly small number of independent data integration providers 
with a stable operating history  consistent profitability  a commitment to channel and the ability to provide a best of breed alternative to large technology stacks  we believe pervasive holds a unique position as a stable yet innovative go to partner for both channel and enterprise customers 
we believe these trends will favor pervasive 
we believe the market for data infrastructure software  in particular  is experiencing significant market disruption due to the high cost of many competing  more labor intensive solutions 
we further believe well established technology leaders who develop deep relationships with channel partners and customers tend to prevail in cost sensitive markets  and pervasive  with its strengths in scalable data management  data integration  and scalable cloud delivery  is well positioned to benefit from the trends in these markets 
the current release of pervasive psql database enables applications that embed the database to deliver significant performance improvements on dual core  core and core servers 
in addition  pervasive datacloud provides an elastic platform as a service that both pervasive and partners can leverage to deliver saas integrations 
the economic environment remains uncertain  but pervasive s financial stability  strong value proposition for customers and partners  and diverse vertical and geographic markets have enabled the company to sustain profitability even in the face of economic headwinds 
we believe that if an economic recovery accelerates and strengthens  our reputation as an established vendor with highly reliable offerings positions pervasive to prosper even further 
pervasive has a strong portfolio that consists both of established products with strong channels and recurring revenue and of innovative  cutting edge technology that leverages potential market disruptors such as multicore hardware  cloud based delivery models and the avalanche of big data 
with a year history of profitability  pervasive remains committed to investing in technology innovation to deliver offerings that differentiate us from competitors  stay current with market trends  and deliver compelling customer value  today and in the future 
risks to our success risks and uncertainties include  among others  our ability to attract and retain existing and or new customers  our ability to issue new products or releases of solutions that meet customers needs or achieve acceptance by the company s customers  changes to current accounting policies which may have a significant  adverse impact upon the company s financial results  the introduction of new products by competitors or the entry of new competitors  our ability to preserve our key strategic relationships  our ability to hire and retain key employees  and economic and political conditions in the us and abroad 
all of these factors  as well as those discussed in item a risk factors  may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and or our ability to sustain or increase our profitability 

table of contents going forward in  the company is focused on the continued marketing of our embedded database product  pervasive psql v  released in september  and the planned release of pervasive psql vx  growing the sales of our integration product line both through direct sales and through highly leverageable indirect channels  continuing the investment in new product and service innovation  including the further advancement of our innovation initiatives from fiscal and earlier pervasive datasolutions to take advantage of market trends in integration as a service and other on demand data solutions  pervasive datacloud to provide a scalable cloud based platform for development and deployment of both pervasive and partner developed on demand services and pervasive datarush to support development and deployment of high throughput applications by capturing the parallel processing capabilities of proliferating multi core technologies  growing the pervasive business xchange web based electronic data interchange business and customer base  and  the continued focus on generating profitable results and positive cash flows  while we look for opportunities to reduce our issued and outstanding shares  putting to work our approved share repurchase program 
we remain committed to a strategic balance of investment in both our flagship and emerging products while also maintaining an intense focus on operating profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation expense taxes revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements 
table of contents involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return product in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns  stock rotation and price protection 
because these reserves are based on our judgments and estimates  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis and review for triggering events on an ongoing basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties in an orderly transaction between market participants 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired 
stock based compensation expense we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility  while the expected life is estimated to be years based on historical trends 
further  we estimate forfeitures for options granted  which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
the estimated fair value is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options having no vesting restrictions and being fully transferable 
accordingly  our estimate of fair value may not represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially impacts our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 

table of contents taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
state tax credit carryforwards are subject to potential expiration if not utilized by certain dates in the future 
the valuation allowance remaining at june  relates entirely to estimated expiration of state tax credit carryforwards prior to utilization 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are occasionally under audit by tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
due to the complexity involved  we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of income 
year ended june  revenues product licenses services and others total revenues costs and expenses cost of product licenses cost of services and other sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income tax provision net income revenues revenue from our embedded database product  pervasive psql  decreased in fiscal years relative to fiscal years and we believe the decrease in was primarily due to a number of relatively large transactions with database customers in fiscal years and for example  we separately disclosed one relatively large transaction with database customers in each of the last three fiscal years in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our embedded database and related products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year however  our integration product revenue in fiscal year grew over fiscal year and over fiscal year  and now represents approximately of our total revenue 
a reduction in our embedded database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we generated total revenue of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to our product license revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents a decrease of from fiscal to  and a decrease of from fiscal to our service and other revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to international revenues  consisting of all revenue from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in international revenues in fiscal year is primarily related to an increase in our database revenues in both europe and japan 
we expect international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
costs and expenses cost of product licenses 
cost of product licenses consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  payment of license fees for third party technologies embedded in 
table of contents our products and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product licenses was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing of total revenues in each of the fiscal years 
we anticipate that cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year cost of services and other 
cost of services and other consists primarily of the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  and the costs to deliver professional services and training services to others 
cost of services and other was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing of total revenues for each of the fiscal years 
we anticipate cost of services and other in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in our sales and marketing personnel and investment in marketing programs in support of our new products and services 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will remain consistent with fiscal year during fiscal year as we support continued growth in our integration products and in support of our new products and services 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to increased research and development spending as a result of the acquisition of channelinx in july we anticipate our research and development spending in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we believe our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense reflects non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock purchase rights and employee stock options 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense was included in costs and expenses as follows amounts in thousands cost of service and other revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total we believe our share based compensation expense in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on various investments and was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal and is primarily the result of lower yields on invested funds and investing a portion of our investments in tax advantaged instruments 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal years  and consists of income taxes related to both our foreign and domestic operations  offset by tax credits generated and other permanent tax differences 

table of contents quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and we believe all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below 
we also believe this information presents fairly the results of each period when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes

such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
we establish our expenditure levels based on expectations as to future revenue  and  if 
table of contents revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we invested  net  million and million in marketable securities in fiscal and  respectively 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale or maturity of marketable securities in fiscal in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for general upgrade requirements for all fiscal years 
during fiscal years  and  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of common stock at a cost of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in july  we announced the authorization of a new million stock repurchase plan which became effective on july   of which approximately million remains available as of june  depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice

we are exploring new opportunities to build  license or acquire products and services for introduction to and through our expansive worldwide channel 
any such transaction could cause us to issue dilutive equity securities  reduce our cash and marketable securities  or incur debt or contingent liabilities 
on june   we had million in working capital including million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to working capital of million at june  summary disclosures about contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands years more than years total less than year years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  which allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings  financial condition  statement of cash flows or earnings per share 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
the amendments in this asu generally represent clarification of topic  but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are to be applied prospectively 
early application is not permitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in belgium  germany  france and england and a joint venture in japan  and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 

table of contents we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june    and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
