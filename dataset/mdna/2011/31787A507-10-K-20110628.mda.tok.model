forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
business overview we are a leading provider of optical subsystems and components that are used to interconnect equipment in short distance local area networks  or lans  storage area networks  or sans  longer distance metropolitan area networks  or mans  fiber to the home networks  or fttx  cable television  or catv  networks and wide area networks  or wans 
our optical subsystems consist primarily of transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders which provide the fundamental optical electrical interface for connecting the equipment used in building these networks  including switches  routers and file servers used in wireline networks as well as antennas and base stations for wireless networks 
these products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuit design and novel packaging technology to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than gigabit per second  or gbps  to gbps  using a wide range of network protocols and physical configurations over distances of meters to kilometers 
we supply optical transceivers and transponders that allow point to point communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or  bundled with multiplexing technologies  can be used to supply multi gigabit bandwidth over several wavelengths on the same fiber 
we also provide products known as wavelength selective switches  or wss  that are used for dynamically switching network traffic from one optical wavelength to another across multiple wavelengths without first converting to an electrical signal 
these products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards  also known as reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers  or roadms 
our line of optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors used in transceivers  primarily for lan and san applications  and passive optical components used in building mans 
demand for our products is largely driven by the continually growing need for additional bandwidth created by the ongoing proliferation of data and video traffic that must be handled by both wireline and wireless networks 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and we produce many of the key components used in making our products including lasers  photodetectors and integrated circuits  or ics  designed by our own internal ic engineering teams 
we also have internal assembly and test capabilities that make use of internally designed equipment for the automated testing of our optical subsystems and components 
we sell our optical products to manufacturers of storage systems  networking equipment and telecommunications equipment such as alcatel lucent  brocade  cisco systems  emc  emulex  ericsson  hewlett packard company  huawei  ibm  juniper  qlogic  siemens and tellabs  and to their contract manufacturers 
these customers  in turn  sell their systems to businesses and to wireline and wireless telecommunications service providers and catv operators  collectively referred to as carriers 

table of contents our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we have undertaken measures to reduce our operating costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to achieve or sustain profitability 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan and san applications 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of overall revenue levels  shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs 
since october  we have completed the acquisition of one publicly held company and a controlling interest in another 
we have also completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
recent developments common stock offering on december   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price to the underwriter of per share 
net proceeds to us after deducting offering expenses were million 
private exchanges of convertible notes in fiscal  we entered into privately negotiated agreements with existing holders of our convertible senior notes due the notes to exchange an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of the notes for a total of approximately million shares of our common stock  based on the conversion price of the notes of per share  plus  additional shares  including  shares issued in payment of accrued and unpaid interest of  we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on these conversions of million as explained below under results of operations 
following these exchanges  million of principal amount of the notes remained outstanding 
repayment of long term debt in the third quarter of fiscal  we repaid in full the remaining principal amounts outstanding under our malaysian and chinese bank loans 
the principal balance outstanding under these loans as of the end of second quarter of fiscal was million and million  respectively 
litigation settlement and resolution in november  following trial in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania  optium corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of finisar  was found liable for patent infringement 
as a result  the court awarded the plaintiffs  jdsu and emcore corporation  approximately million in damages plus interest 
the judgment was with respect to complaints filed on september  and march  by jdsu and emcore alleging that certain cable television transmission products sold by optium infringed certain us patents 
we appealed this judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on january   the federal circuit affirmed the judgment 
a petition for rehearing has been filed 
nevertheless  because of the historically low percentage of requests for rehearing that are granted by the federal circuit  we recorded a charge for the judgment of approximately million as general and administrative expense in the quarterly period ended january  the judgment was paid in full in the fourth quarter of fiscal  following denial of our petition for rehearing 
on september   we entered into a settlement and cross license agreement with source photonics  inc  resolving a lawsuit that we had filed on january   alleging that certain optoelectronic transceivers from source photonics  inc infringed eleven of our patents 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  source photonics paid a license fee to us in the amount of million for a fully paid up license to our digital diagnostics and transceiver module patents through december  payment in full was made by september  we used present value techniques to discount our estimated historical and future revenue streams of the infringing source photonics products and used the discounted revenue 
table of contents streams as a basis to allocate the million settlement and license payment amount between source photonics historical and future uses of our patents 
we determined that million of this settlement amount was attributable to past damages  and that amount was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses upon receipt 
the remaining million was accounted as deferred revenue and will be recognized as license revenue ratably over the remaining license term through december  during the quarter ended october  we incurred million in contingent and other legal fees in connection with the settlement of this litigation which was recorded as general and administrative expense 
investment in ignis asa during the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased million shares of ignis asa ignis  a norwegian company traded on the oslo stock exchange for total consideration of million 
this investment was carried on our financial statements at its fair value and classified as available for sale 
after this investment  we held an ownership position in ignis of 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired an aggregate of million additional shares from certain existing ignis shareholders for nok per share in cash  or an aggregate purchase price of nok million million 
as a result of these purchases  our ownership position in ignis increased to approximately 
as a result of this additional investment  we determined that we had acquired the ability to exercise significant influence over ignis 
therefore  we accounted for this investment using the equity method 
accordingly  our proportionate share of the net loss of ignis from the date of purchase of the million shares   has been included in our consolidated statement of operations under other income expense  net 
the aggregate value of these shares as of april  based on the quoted market price was million 
on march   we entered into a transaction agreement with ignis  under which we made a recommended voluntary public cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ignis not currently owned by us for nok per share 
on may   we completed this tender offer and purchased an additional million shares of ignis for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we own approximately of the outstanding shares of ignis following completion of this acquisition 
under the norwegian securities trading act  finisar s ownership of more than one third of the voting shares of ignis triggered the requirement for us to make a mandatory unconditional offer for all remaining outstanding ignis shares 
on may  we launched a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares at a cash offer price of nok per share 
during the offer period for the mandatory offer  which ended on june   approximately million additional shares of ignis were tendered 
we expect to complete the purchase of these shares during the last week of june for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as a result  of these additional purchases  we will own approximately of the outstanding shares of ignis 
as a result of acquiring more than of the outstanding ignis shares  we will have the right to effect a compulsory acquisition of the balance of the outstanding shares of ignis not owned by us for a cash price of nok per share 
we intend to proceed with the compulsory acquisition promptly following the completion of the purchase of the shares tendered in the mandatory offer 
ignis asa is an innovative provider of optical components and network solutions for fiber optic communications 
it operates globally through four subsidiaries fi ra photonics in korea owned and wholly owned subsidiaries syntune in sweden  ignis photonyx in denmark  and smartoptics in norway 
ignis product and services portfolio comprises passive optical components including optical chips  splitters and multiplexers  active optical components such as tunable lasers and modulators  and wdm based solutions enabling the building of simple and cost effective high capacity optical networks 
we believe that this acquisition will provide us with access to ignis tunable laser products which we believe have the highest performance of any such devices currently available in the market  further our vertical integration strategy by providing an internal source of these devices  which we currently purchase on the merchant market  enable us to offer our customers a number of new and gbps products based on the advanced optical device integration technologies of ignis various business units  and allow us to expand our product portfolio to include a number of other products incorporating innovative technologies and focus on attractive growth markets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures require that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue and operating results  as well as on the value of certain assets and contingent liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of other significant accounting policies 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the fiscal year ended april  compared to prior years 
revenue recognition  warranty and sales returns 
table of contents we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
our standard warranty period usually extends months from the date of sale although it can extend for longer periods of three to five years for certain products sold to certain customers 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be incurred could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
we also provide an allowance for estimated customer returns  which is netted against revenue 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be reduced in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where  subsequent to delivery  we become aware of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for the doubtful account to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and historical actual bad debt history 
a material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could result in a material reduction in the estimated amount of accounts receivable that can ultimately be collected and an increase in our general and administrative expenses for the shortfall 
slow moving and obsolete inventories we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically discard obsolete inventory 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we assume that the last twelve months demand is generally indicative of the demand for the next twelve months 
in addition to the month demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future timing of product transitions  volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual timing  volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future  or additional usage of previously written off inventory in future periods for which we would benefit from a reduced cost of revenues in those future periods 
investment in equity securities for strategic reasons  we may make minority investments in private or public companies or extend loans or receive equity or debt from these companies for services rendered or assets sold 
our minority investments in private companies are primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
our investments in these companies are passive in nature in that we generally do not obtain representation on the boards of directors 
our investments have generally been part of a larger financing in which the terms were negotiated by other investors  typically venture capital investors 
these investments are generally made in exchange for preferred stock with a liquidation preference that helps protect the underlying value of our investment 
at the time we made our investments  in most cases the companies had not completed development of their products and we did not enter into any significant supply agreements with the companies in which we invested 
in determining if and when a decline in the market value of these investments below their carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings and cash flows  price multiples  prospects for liquidity and other key measures of performance 
our policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists  such as a the completion of a new equity financing that may indicate a new value for the 
table of contents investment  b the failure to complete a new equity financing arrangement after seeking to raise additional funds or c the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results at any of the companies in which we hold a minority position could result in an impairment of our investment and or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets goodwill  purchased technology  and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of purchased technology and other intangibles has been provided on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years 
goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step in which we determine the implied value of goodwill based on the allocation of the estimated fair value determined in the initial step to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we write those assets down to their fair value which is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment of the businesses in which we operate 
at april   goodwill was zero and intangible assets were million 
during fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges for goodwill as discussed under results of operation 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation cost for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to april  was valued under the multiple option approach and will continue to be amortized using the accelerated attribution method 
subsequent to april   compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we calculate the volatility factor based on our historical stock prices 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we measure the fair value of restricted stock units using the market value on the grant date 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures 
table of contents differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
restructuring accrual we are required to recognize liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
we calculate facilities consolidation charges using estimates that are based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating the leased facilities are based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
should operating lease rental rates decline from current estimates or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility  adjustments to the facilities lease losses reserve will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon the current actual events and circumstances 
accounting for income taxes we apply the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and their reported amounts  along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
we reduce the deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of all foreign corporate subsidiaries accumulated in fiscal and subsequent years 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations

revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects the impact of a combination of factors including increased spending on infrastructure by business enterprises and telecommunications companies as they deal with the ongoing growth in bandwidth through their networks as well as improvement in general economic conditions that contributed to an increase in information technology infrastructure spending 
additionally  we believe that we achieved an increase in our market share  particularly for higher speed products  due in part to the qualification of several products for higher speed applications at certain customers and our entry into new markets 
the following table sets forth the changes in revenues by product segment and speed in thousands

amortization of acquired developed technology  a component of cost of revenues  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to full amortization of certain technology acquired in connection with the honeywell acquisition in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of revenues increased by  from in fiscal to in fiscal we recorded charges of million for obsolete and excess inventory in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we sold inventory that was written off in previous periods resulting in a benefit of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result  we recognized a net charge of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal manufacturing overhead includes stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding amortization of acquired developed technology  the net impact of excess and obsolete inventory charges and stock based compensation charges  gross profit would have been million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross margin primarily reflects the benefits of higher manufacturing unit volume and the increase in sales of higher margin high speed components and roadm products  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower pricing on some products 
although revenues increased by in fiscal  manufacturing overhead costs increased by only compared to fiscal  primarily due to greater utilization of fixed manufacturing capacity 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to increases in employee related expenses and costs of materials associated with new product development 
included in research and development expenses were stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of the increase in revenues 
the increase was also partly due to an increase in employee related expenses 
included in sales and marketing expenses were stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the million accrual for damages payable as the result of an unfavorable judgment in the jdsu and emcore corporation litigation described above  and an increase in personnel related costs  partially offset by million of litigation settlement income net of legal costs associated with the settlement with source photonics inc described above 
included in general and administrative expenses were stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the optium merger in fiscal interest income 
interest income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in our cash balances reflecting the receipt of million in net proceeds from our common stock offering in march and million in net proceeds from our common stock offering in december interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily related to lower outstanding debt due to repayment of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due and our convertible senior subordinated notes due pursuant to exchange offers in the second quarter of fiscal  repurchases of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible senior subordinated notes in the second quarter of fiscal and repayment of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due and million principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due in the second quarter of fiscal interest expense for fiscal included million related to our convertible subordinated notes due october  million related to various other debt instruments and a non cash charge of  due to accretion of the original issue discount created by the conversion option in the senior subordinated convertible notes  as interest expense over the term of the instrument using the interest method 
interest expense for fiscal included million related to our convertible subordinated notes due october  million related to our convertible subordinated notes which were fully repaid in october  a non cash charge of million related to the accounting for our senior convertible notes and million related to various other debt instruments 
loss on debt extinguishment 
as described above  in fiscal  we entered into privately negotiated agreements with existing holders of our convertible senior notes due to exchange an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of the notes for shares of our common stock 
we recognized loss on debt extinguishment of million on these exchanges  representing the fair value of the shares issued in excess of the number of shares issuable in accordance with the original conversion terms of the notes 
this loss on debt extinguishment compares to million of interest expense that would have been payable with respect to the million in exchanged notes through their first maturity date in october had such notes not been exchanged 
other income expense  net 
other expense was million in fiscal compared to other expense of million in fiscal other expense in fiscal primarily consisted of foreign exchange losses of million  million of amortization of debt issuance costs for our convertible senior notes and million of amortization of issuance costs related to other debt 
other expense in fiscal was primarily due to a million write down of a minority investment as the decline in its value was other than temporary 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the income tax provision for fiscal primarily represents current state and foreign income taxes arising in certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of our future profitability  we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets which represent future income tax benefits associated with our operating losses because we do not believe it is more likely than not these assets will be realized 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal included minimum state taxes of  federal refundable credits of  and foreign income tax benefit of million arising in certain foreign jurisdictions in which the company conducts business 
income from discontinued operation  net of taxes 
the transition services agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of the assets of the network tools division  under which we agreed to provide manufacturing services to jdsu during the transition period  was completed on july  total operating expenses incurred in relation to the transition services agreement during fiscal was  income from discontinued operations for fiscal was million  including a gain on the sale of the business unit of million 
comparison of fiscal years ended april  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects the impact of a combination of factors including increased spending on infrastructure by business enterprises and telecommunications companies as they deal with the ongoing growth in bandwidth through their networks as well 
table of contents as improvement in general economic conditions that contributed to an increase in information technology infrastructure spending 
additionally  we believe that we achieved an increase in our market share  particularly for higher speed products  due in part to the qualification of several products for higher speed applications at certain customers and our entry into new markets

as a result of the financial liquidity crisis  the economic recession  reductions in our internal revenue and operating forecasts and a substantial reduction in our market capitalization  during fiscal  we performed an analysis to determine if there was an indication of impairment of our intangible assets

table of contents to various restrictions and limitations 
convertible debt consists of a series of convertible senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million due october  the notes are convertible by the holders at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at specified conversion prices 
the notes are redeemable by us  in whole or in part at any time on or after october  if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date on which we provide the notice of redemption 
these notes are also subject to redemption by the holders in october   and interest on debt consists of the scheduled interest payments on our convertible debt 
operating lease obligations consist primarily of base rents for facilities we occupy at various locations 
purchase obligations represent all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  their terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
our policy with respect to all purchase obligations is to record losses  if any  when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
our subcontractors purchase materials based on forecasts provided by us 
we record a liability for firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities held by subcontractors on our behalf to fulfill the subcontractors purchase order obligations at their facilities which are in excess of our future demand forecasts 
as of april   the liability for these purchase commitments of million has been expensed and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as other accrued liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 
we believe we have made adequate provisions for potential exposure related to inventory purchases for orders that may not be utilized 
sources of liquidity and capital resource requirements at april   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and an aggregate of million available for borrowing under our credit facility with wells fargo foothill  llc  subject to certain restrictions and limitations 
of this cash and cash equivalent  million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of april we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash expected to be generated from future operations and borrowings under our bank credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to fund our operations in the future  to finance future acquisitions that we may propose to undertake or to repay or otherwise retire all of our outstanding convertible senior notes due  in the aggregate principal amount of million  which are subject to redemption by the holders in october   and a significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital if and when it is required  especially if we experience disappointing operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements at april  and april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of april   we had approximately million of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of outstanding 
the fair value of this debt as of april  was approximately million 
the fair value of the convertible notes is based on the market price in the open market as of or close to april  the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is primarily due to the spread between the conversion price and the market value of the shares underlying the conversion 
we are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value of the debt due to the volatility of the stock market 
we had no variable interest rate debt outstanding which would expose us to interest rate risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are 
table of contents included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership interest is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
at april   we had investments in three privately held companies that totaled million and were accounted for under the cost method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
there were impairment losses on these assets of million during fiscal we concluded that there were sufficient indicators during the second quarter of fiscal to require an investment impairment analysis of our investment in one of these companies 
among these indicators was the completion of a new round of equity financing by the investee and the resultant conversion of the company s preferred stock holdings to common stock 
we determined that the value of our minority equity investment was impaired and recorded a million impairment loss as other expense during the second quarter of fiscal no impairment losses were recorded in fiscal or fiscal if our investment in a privately held company becomes readily marketable upon the company s completion of an initial public offering or its acquisition by another company  our investment would be subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
we have subsidiaries located in china  malaysia  europe  israel  australia and singapore 
due to the relative volume of transactions through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years
