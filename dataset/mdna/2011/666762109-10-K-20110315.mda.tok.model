item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report and any other cautionary statements contained herein 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  levels of market interest rates  and by competition  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results of operations particularly dependent on the alaska economy 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting a target range and minimum for the net interest margin and running simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
in order to control interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to shorten the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize the pricing of new loans on a floating rate basis in order to achieve a more asset sensitive position  thereby allowing quicker repricings and maximizing net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  our philosophy is to lengthen the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize fixed rate loans  thereby becoming more liability sensitive 
in each case  the goal is to exceed our targeted net interest income range without exceeding earnings risk parameters 
our excess liquidity not needed for current operations has generally been invested in short term assets or securities  primarily securities issued by government sponsored entities 
the securities portfolio contributes to our profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
the primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is determination of mix  maturity  and repricing characteristics of the loan portfolios 
the loan and securities portfolios must be used in combination with management of deposits and borrowing liabilities and other asset liability techniques to actively manage the applicable components of the balance sheet 
in doing so  we estimate our future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases  and estimated interest rate changes 
although analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk  we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance it should not be used as the primary indicator of exposure to interest rate risk and the related volatility of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate gap analysis is primarily a measure of liquidity based upon the amount of change in principal amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding  as opposed to a measure of changes in the overall net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data based upon 
table of contents regulatory reporting formats and  therefore  may not be wholly consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in the audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  within year years years total in thousands interest earning assets overnight investments investment securities loans commercial real estate construction real estate term loans held for sale home equity line and other consumer total interest earning assets percent of total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities percent of total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as stated previously  certain shortcomings  including those described below  are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in their interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the lives of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables as can the relationship of rates between different loan and deposit categories 
moreover  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
we utilize a simulation model to monitor and manage interest rate risk within parameters established by our internal policy 
the model projects the impact of a basis point increase and a basis point decrease  from prevailing interest rates  on the balance sheet over a period of months 
generalized assumptions are made on how investment securities  classes of loans and various deposit products might respond to the interest rate changes 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the 
table of contents model cannot precisely estimate net interest income nor precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results would differ from simulated results due to factors such as timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes  customer reaction to rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
as indicated in the table above  at december   the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature faster than the company s earning assets by a margin of million over the next months 
based on the results of the simulation models at december   we expect an increase in net interest income of  over a month period if interest rates decreased an immediate basis points 
the results were limited since interest rates were already at a low point and a further decrease resulted in some indexes being nonexistent 
conversely  we expect a slight decrease of  in net interest income over a month period if interest rates increased an immediate basis points 
the decrease in net interest income of  in a basis point immediate increase in interest rates showed that loans priced with floors will not experience the full impact of a basis point increase until interest rates increase beyond basis points
