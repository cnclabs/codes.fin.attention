the assets  liabilities and results of operations of our foreign operations are measured using the functional currency of such foreign operation

is the us dollar 
the functional currency of transatlantic petroleum ltd

as a result  translation adjustments will result from the process of translating the functional currency of our subsidiary financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency

commodity price risk our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our senior secured credit facility with standard bank and bnp paribas suisse sa  at least one of the borrowers is required to maintain commodity derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas suisse sa 
in december  temi entered into costless derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas suisse sa  which hedge the price of oil during and in april  temi entered into three way collar contracts and additional costless derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas suisse sa  which hedge the price of oil during and pursuant to our senior secured credit facility  we cannot enter into hedge agreements that  when aggregated with any other hydrocarbon hedge agreement then in effect  covers notional volumes in excess of of the reasonably projected production volumes attributable to our proved developed reserves 
the derivative contracts economically hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil production 
while the use of the hedging arrangements will limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
the costless collars provide us with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price we will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price we will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly 
these contracts may or may not involve payment or receipt of cash at inception  depending on the ceiling and floor pricing 
the three way collar contracts consist of a purchased put  a sold call and a purchased call 
the purchased put establishes a lower limit floor price  the sold call establishes an upper limit ceiling price and the purchased call establishes a second floor price on the hedged volumes 
the three way collar contracts require our counterparty to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price 
we are required to pay our counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price but below the second floor price  and our counterparty is required to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the second floor price 
neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price 
the three way collar contracts are settled monthly 
we have elected not to designate our derivative financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes  and accordingly  we record such contracts at fair value and recognize changes in such fair value in current earnings as they occur 
our commodity derivative contracts are carried at their fair value in earnings as they occur 
we recognize unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption gain loss on commodity derivative contracts 
settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
if commodity prices decrease  this commodity price change could have a positive impact to our earnings 
conversely  if commodity prices increase  this commodity price change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
each derivative contract is evaluated separately to determine its own fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million 
we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million in the following tables summarize our outstanding derivatives contracts with respect to future crude oil production as of december  type period quantity bbl day weighted average minimum price per bbl weighted average maximum price per bbl estimated fair value of liability in thousands collar january  december   collar january  december
