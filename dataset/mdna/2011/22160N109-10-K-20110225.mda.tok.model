since  we have expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information and marketing services and developed new information  marketing and analytic services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc in san francisco in in august  we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january  we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  inc and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison research  inc in february  we acquired comps

in may  we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research  inc  and in september  we extended our coverage of the uk through the acquisition of scottish property network 
in september  we strengthened our position in denver  colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp  inc  a local comparable sales information provider 
in january  we acquired national research bureau  a connecticut based provider of us shopping center information 
in december  our uk subsidiary  costar limited  acquired grecam sas grecam  a provider of commercial property information and market level surveys  studies and consulting services located in paris  france 
in february  costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited propex  a provider of commercial property information and operator of an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property located in london  england 
in april  we acquired the assets of first cls  inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro  an atlanta based provider of local commercial real estate information 
most recently  in july  we acquired massachusetts based property and portfolio research  inc ppr  a provider of real estate analysis  market forecasts and credit risk analytics to the commercial real estate industry  and its wholly owned uk subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd  and in october  we acquired massachusetts based resolve technology  a provider of business intelligence and portfolio management software serving the institutional real estate investment industry 
the ppr and resolve technology acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading recent acquisitions 
we have consistently worked to expand our service offerings  both in terms of geographical coverage and the scope of services offered  in order to position the company for future revenue growth 
in  we began our expansion into new metropolitan markets throughout the us and began expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and us markets 
we completed our expansion into the new markets in the first quarter of in early  in conjunction with the acquisition of national research bureau  we launched a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information 
the retail component of our flagship product  costar property professional  was unveiled in may at the international council of shopping centers convention in las vegas 
during the second half of  in order to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings  we began actively researching commercial properties in new core based statistical areas cbsas in the us  we increased our us field research fleet by adding vehicles and we hired researchers to staff these vehicles 
we released our costar property professional service in the new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of throughout our recent expansion efforts  we have remained focused on ensuring that costar continues to provide the quality of information our customers expect 
as such  in we expanded our research operations  and we plan to continue to grow our research operations slightly in in order to continue to meet customer expectations 
during the second half of  as a part of our strategy to provide subscribers with tools for conducting primary research and analysis on commercial real estate  we expanded subscribers capabilities to use costar s database of research verified commercial property information to conduct in depth analysis and generate reports on trends in sales and leasing activity online 
further  in july  we acquired ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary  providers of real estate investment analysis and market forecasting services 
in connection with our acquisitions of propex  grecam and ppr s wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd  we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 
we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 
in  we introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations  and in early we launched showcase  our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public websites  in the uk we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for long term growth  which we intend to continue to develop  invest in and expand 
we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services within our current platform  and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization 
for instance  in july  we expanded subscribers analytic capabilities to use our online database to conduct in depth analysis and generate reports on sales and leasing activity through our acquisition of ppr and in october  we acquired resolve technology  which enabled us to provide our customers with additional tools for analyzing commercial real estate markets 
any future expansion  including expansion through acquisitions and expansion internationally  could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings throughout and pro viding substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
our goal is to provide additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers 
for example  we are currently focusing on integration and further development of the ppr and resolve technology service offerings 
we have launched an initiative to develop a discounted cash flow dcf forecasting and valuation solution that effectively integrates the combined capabilities of costar s market and property information and ppr s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology s real estate investment software expertise 
in order to implement this initiative  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur additional costs  including costs of hiring additional personnel 
while our investments in ppr and resolve technology have resulted a nd may continue to result in an increase in expenses  our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions  and we have experienced increased cross selling opportunities among costar and the acquired companies 
in some cases  the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world  resulting at times in business consolidations and  in some circumstances  business failure 
if cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay continue at the current rate or increase  and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers  our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates 
additionally  current economic conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses  and customers may be forced to purchase fewer services from us or cancel all services 
we compete against many other commercial real estate information  marketing and analytic service providers for busine ss 
if customers choose to cancel our services for cost cutting or other reasons  our revenue could decline 
there are clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry  including heightened leasing activity and positive net absorption of office space  resulting from modest office related job growth and recent business expansions in the us the extent and duration of continued improvement of the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown  as is the extent and duration of any benefits resulting from any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy 
because of these uncertainties and any resulting impact on our business  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or earnings 
based on current economic conditions  we believe that the company is positioned to generate continued  sustained earnings from current operations in and for the foreseeable future 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes  as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods 
currency exchange rate volatility may continue  which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and period to period comparisons of our consolidated operations 
we currently issue stock options and or restricted stock to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we plan to continue the use of stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock  restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
we recently decided to take advantage of favorable market conditions to lower our long term occupancy costs as a tenant 
as part of our overall strategy to consolidate our london office locations and reduce occupancy costs  we relocated our london offices and in july entered into a settlement pursuant to which we terminated our lease for our former london offices 
in addition  in september  we consolidated our three facilities located in the boston  massachusetts area  including the facilities used by costar  ppr and resolve technology  into one facility 
we recorded a lease restructuring charge of approximately million in general and administrative expense in the third quarter of as a result of the boston office consolidation 
in december  we consolidated our new york and isel in  new jersey offices into one facility 
the consolidation of these facilities did not result in a lease restructuring charge 
on february   we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington  dc for million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location 
the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda  md expired on october   therefore  we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters 
we were able to create value through our occupancy of the building in washington  dc and on february  sold the building for aggregate consideration of million  million of which is being held in escrow to fund additional build out and planned improvements at the building 
as part of the sale  we entered into a long term lease with the buye r to lease back approximately of the office space  where our corporate headquarters will remain 
we expect that the lease back arrangement will result in additional expense of approximately million to million in our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  and focus services currently generate more than of our total revenues 
costar property professional  costar tenant  and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment 
focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment 
the majority of our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regu larly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are generally based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the twelve months ended december  and  our contract renewal rate for subscription based services was approximately and  respectively  and therefore our cancellation rate was approximately and  respectively  for the same periods of time 
our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results 
as a result  management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short term and long term performance 
our trailing twelve month contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures and or consolidations among our clients  further reductions in customer spending  or decreases in our customer base 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different acceptable assumptions would yield different result s 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
fair value of auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
there is a three tier fair value hierarchy  which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
our level assets consist of auction rate securities ars  whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  credit spreads  timing and amount of cash flows  liquidity risk premiums  expected holding periods and default risk of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of december   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million 
the decline was deemed to be a temporary impair ment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions and or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments  which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 
fair value of deferred consideration our level liabilities consist of a million liability as of december  for deferred consideration related to the october  acquisition of resolve technology 
the deferred consideration is for i a potential deferred cash payment two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology s revenue  and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through october   which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december  we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our level liabilities as of december  the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate  estimates for future incremental revenue growth and probabilities for completion of operational and sales milestones 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the deferred consideration 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the deferred consideration as of december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  we may be required to recognize additional liabilities related to this deferred consideration 
stock based compensation we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fair value based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to estimate the dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the stock option 
these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors  including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and post employment termination behavior  expected future employee option exercise patterns  and the historical volatility of the company s stock price 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock based compensation expense for the twelve months ended december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  they could have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets 
the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors  including the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we consider our operating segments  us and international  as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss 
we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 
as of october   the date of our most recent impairment analysis  the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october  that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
 to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
ebitda is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stock based compensation expense  acquisition re lated costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stock based compensation expense  acquisition related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs 
we may disclose adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 
we view ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance u nder gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business 
we believe that these non gaap measures  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information  marketing and analytic services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has inclu ded significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition costs and restructuring costs 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
we believe the disclosure of these non gaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe these non gaap measures are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and other items  such as interest  income taxes  stock based compensation expenses  acquisition costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income or non gaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses  depreciation and other amortization  interest income  net  and income tax expense benefit as previously described above with respect to the calculation of ebitda 
stock based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives 
determining the fair value of the stock based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
therefore  we believe it is useful to exclude stock based compensation in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
the amount of acquisition related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to the acquisition 
because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel 
we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of headquarters acquisition and transition related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the overlapping rent and building carrying costs  legal costs and other related costs incurred to relocate our headquarters 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of material settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are stock based compensation  acquisition related costs  restructuring costs  headquarter acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 
we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non gaap net income 
we assume a tax rate in order to approximate our long term effective corporate tax rate 
non gaap net income per diluted share is a non gaap financial measure that represents non gaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of business segment results for year ended december  and year ended december  we manage our business geographically in two operating segments  with our primary areas of measurement and decision making being the us and international  which includes the uk and france 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda  which is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business

on july   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ppr  and its wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd  providers of real estate analysis  market forecasts and credit risk analytics to the commercial real estate industry 
we acquired ppr from dmg information  inc dmgi in exchange for  shares of costar common stock  which had an aggregate value of approximately million as of the closing date

these acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
for each of the ppr and resolve technology acquisitions  the purchase price was allocated to various working capital accounts  developed technology  customer base  trademarks  non competition agreements and goodwill 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over ten years 
the identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill for these acquisitions is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of ppr and resolve technology have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to the purchase of a  square foot office building located at l street  nw in downtown washington  dc for a purchase price of million in cash  and approximately million in acquisition costs  as well as other purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  partially offset by net cash flows from operating and financing activities of million 
changes in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as accounts receivable  accounts payable  various accrued expenses and deferred revenues  as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises  purchases and sales of short term investments and similar events 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the  increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements partially offset by a decrease of approximately million from net income plus non cash items 
the million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately million and approximately million in increased change in deferred revenue primarily associated with cash received for annual bill ings 
the increase in the change in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately million includes increased changes in accruals of deferred rent of approximately million   accrued in june in anticipation of the settlement of a litigation matter   remaining in the lease restructuring charge associated with our boston lease consolidation in september and increased accruals associated with the operations of our recent acquisitions and new headquarters 
these increases in changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in the changes in income tax receivable of approximately million  as the tax legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of allowed us to deduct of qualifying assets purchased after september   resulting in an income tax receivable recorded for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  this million increased change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the february purchase of our new headquarters in downtown washington  dc  as well as capital improvements for our facilities in  partially offset by the million in net cash payments for acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was relatively consistent at million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  contractual obligations

the closing of the sale took place on february  the aggregate consid eration paid by gll to holdings pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement was million in cash  million of which is being held in escrow to fund additional build out and planned improvements at the building 
the lease is effective as of june  and will expire may  the initial base rent is per square foot of occupied space  escalating per year commencing june  our obligation to pay rent increases proportionately over the course of the first year of the lease as certain scheduled completion dates for our build out  on a floor by floor basis  are reached 
our occupied space under the lease will consist of the entire rented premises as of june   from and after which we will owe rent on the entire leased premises 
annual lease payments for will be approximately million 
this obligation is not included in the above december  contractual obligation table 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our operating results  expansion efforts  and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we may use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
in the third quarter of  we issued  shares of common stock to dmgi  inc for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary 
in october  we acquired resolve technology for approximately million million was paid upon acquisition and  was deferred until february in cash and  shares of costar common stock  which had an aggregate value of approximately million as of the closing date

while we continue to earn interest on these investments  the investments are not liquid in the short term

as such  fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for the year ended december   revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately of total revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currenc ies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in the carrying amount of net assets 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have increased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a weakening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  in the carrying amount of net assets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all 
as of december   accumulated other c omprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately million 
we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not believe that increases or decreases in interest rates will impact our ability to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
included within our long term investments are investments in mostly aaa rated student loan ars 
these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education 
as of december   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
as a result  we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful 
in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments  we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process  who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par  resulting in a loss 
based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december   we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have approximately million in intangible assets as of december  as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
