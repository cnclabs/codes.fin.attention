operational and financial overview the company reported net sales of million  a record annual amount  reflecting an increase of nearly million  or  compared to the combination of a recovery in most of the markets that lydall serves as well as improved market share resulted in the significant increase in net sales in the operating income of million  or of net sales  was significantly depressed by the operating results of the thermal acoustical segment  serving the automotive industry 
in particular  the gross margin in was negatively impacted by the fiber based product line of the north american automotive facility na auto starting towards the end of the second quarter of  as production was rapidly ramped up to meet a sharp increase in customer demand 
although manufacturing improvements have been made in the fourth quarter of  the company estimates that million of fiber based product net sales generated a gross margin loss of approximately million from june  through december  performance materials segment the performance materials segment reported record net sales of million in  which represented an increase of from  and operating income of million  or of net sales 
gross margin and operating income as a percentage of net sales both increased primarily as a result of the significant increase in net sales and improved absorption of fixed costs 
demand for filtration products by customers in the air filtration  fluid power and automotive and life science markets in rebounded dramatically as customers began recovering from the global economic recession 
also  in  the industrial thermal insulation business benefited from significant improvement in capital project investments by customers in the cryogenic and electrical markets  increasing demand for the company s energy and industrial products 
the filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses are in markets that the company believes present long term growth opportunities through expansion of existing products and through strategic transactions 
with a strong backlog of orders  the segment is actively managing growth by selectively investing in capabilities to enhance processes and capacity 
the segment has realigned manufacturing capabilities among its production sites  which has enabled improved optimization of existing capacity and created additional capacity to grow the business organically 
further  products and activities are continually evaluated for strategic fit  as evidenced by the sale of the electrical papers product line in performance materials remains focused on fully commercializing the arioso membrane composite media  which was developed based on technologies obtained through the solutech acquisition in late arioso provides advanced filtration media for respirator  clean room and industrial dust collection applications 
although product development and customer qualification have taken longer than originally planned  the arioso product represents an important growth area and is expected to expand the company s market participation in the industrial air and life science arena

the same service predicts that production of cars and light trucks in north america and europe in will grow again in the range of 
while automobile production improved significantly in and is expected to increase again in  volatile market conditions  including fluctuations in consumer demand for automobiles  persist in the automotive market 

table of contents the segment reported operating income in of million compared with an operating loss of million in beginning late in the second quarter of  the segment has been impacted by negative gross margin from the fiber based product line of the na auto facility 
during the second half of  the company responded to a rapid acceleration of orders with a plant expansion  addition of new equipment  hiring and training of a significant number of new employees and fabrication of tooling  all while simultaneously increasing output to meet customers demand 
as a result  the company incurred abnormally high labor costs  material usage inefficiencies and excessive scrap on production lines  and freight expediting and inspection costs 
also  due to capacity constraints  the facility outsourced a portion of the processing of certain fibers at a premium 
while the company has undertaken a comprehensive improvement plan to stabilize this operation  the full impact of actions underway has not yet been fully realized 
the operating loss of million in included million of restructuring related charges associated with the na auto consolidation 
other products and services the vital fluids business  which serves the life science industry  reported net sales of million in  an increase of compared to  and operating results were essentially breakeven in compared to operating income of million in during and  the company made capital investments in clean room space capacity and acquired biodisposable bag manufacturing equipment to support a strategic initiative to increase market share in the growing bioprocessing market 
during  the business initiated the qualification of products with a number of new customers 
however  due to the lengthy period of time required for qualification  incremental revenues did not materialize in during  the vital fluids business expects certain customers to begin to complete the qualification process initiated in and start to order biodisposable bags from the company 
throughout  the affinity business benefited from the recovery of capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry as evidenced by an increase in net sales of million  to million  in the business has begun to realize sales from the s series  a configurable industrial chiller launched in  which is expected to open several new markets in the future  including medical  analytical  scientific  and industrial 
service revenues in the chiller markets have grown as well and the business has gained profitability both through absorption of costs from higher revenues and from employing lean principles to systematically improve gross margins 
liquidity at december   the company had cash balances of million and no borrowings under any existing credit facility 
consistent with the fourth quarter of  the company expects to be subject to a million borrowing limit under its domestic credit facility throughout the first quarter of and possibly future periods because it does not expect to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   the company s foreign subsidiaries had various credit arrangements with banks totaling million approximately million with million approximately million available for borrowings  primarily restricted to borrowings at the respective foreign subsidiary 
the company expects to fund its operating cash requirements from existing cash balances  cash generated by operations and from available borrowings  as needed  under its existing domestic credit facility and foreign credit facilities 
during  the company increased working capital  primarily inventory  in order to meet anticipated customer demand 
at december   inventory increased by million compared to levels at december   primarily from increases in raw material inventory 
also contributing to the increase in working capital were significant cash investments in automotive tooling inventory and tooling accounts receivable during in preparation of launches of new automotive parts in typically  the company is not reimbursed for tooling inventory until completion and customer approval of the tooling 
outlook at december   the company s backlog was significantly higher than december  going into  the top priority for the company is to improve its operating results  particularly those of the thermal acoustical segment 
as part of lydall s business strategy  the company will continue to review various strategic and business opportunities to grow its businesses and evaluate the profitability and growth potential for each of its existing businesses

gross margin in thousands of dollars revised revised gross margin percentage of sales the increase in gross margin percentage in compared to was attributable to improved gross margin percentages from both the performance materials and thermal acoustical segments  as well as from the affinity business included in ops 
the performance materials segment and affinity business reported improved gross margin percentages primarily as a result of significantly higher net sales and the resulting improved absorption of fixed costs 
the gross margin percentage included restructuring related charges of million  or basis points  associated with the na auto consolidation  included in the thermal acoustical segment 
excluding these restructuring charges in  the thermal acoustical segment gross margin percentage increased marginally in compared to due to improvements in gross margin percentage for worldwide non fiber based products from higher sales partially offset by higher per unit costs for fiber based products at its na auto facility 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily caused by lower gross margin percentage from the thermal acoustical segment and  to a lesser extent  from the performance materials segment and from ops  which were all significantly impacted by global economic conditions 
a reduction in net sales of million  including a decrease in thermal acoustical segment net sales of million  resulted in higher per unit manufacturing costs  as each unit absorbed a greater amount of fixed costs 
also  higher raw material costs in  compared to  contributed to lower gross margin percentage for the thermal acoustical segment 
the aforementioned restructuring related charges of million negatively impacted gross margin percentage by approximately basis points in partially offsetting the above factors reducing gross margin percentage was savings realized from the company s lean six sigma program 
selling  product development and administrative expenses in thousands of dollars selling  product development and administrative expenses percentage of sales selling  product development and administrative expenses increased in by million  or  compared to however  as a percentage of net sales  selling  product development and administrative expenses decreased by basis points in 
table of contents compared to the increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation expense of million  sales commission expense of million  legal expenses of million  primarily associated with a matter with a former employee  salaries and wages expense of million  severance related expenses of million and research and development trial expenses of million 
because certain businesses met bonus plan targets  the company recorded incentive compensation in  while in  the company did not record any incentive compensation expense 
a significant increase in net sales in  compared to  caused the increase in sales commission expense in higher salaries and wages expense was primarily caused by higher headcount in compared to to support the increase in net sales in and strategic initiatives for the company  and  to a lesser extent  the reinstatement of the matching contribution to its sponsored k plan in july  for all non union domestic employees 
foreign currency translation decreased selling  product development and administrative expenses by million  or  for the current year  compared with selling  product development and administrative expenses decreased in by million compared to the inclusion of expenses from the solutech business  included in the performance materials segment and acquired in december  resulted in an additional million of selling  product development and administrative expenses in including the results of the solutech business  the overall reduction in selling  product development and administrative expenses in was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages expense of million  incentive compensation expense of million  sales commission expenses of million  travel expenses of million and bad debt expense of million  as well as reductions in other discretionary spending 
partially offsetting these decreases was higher expense of million related to the amortization of intangible assets of the solutech business 
lower salaries and wages expense was due to reductions in workforce from the na auto consolidation completed in the first half of  other workforce reduction initiatives  and the december realignment of management within the company s north american and european automotive operations  resulting in lower salaries and wages expense in lower incentive compensation expense was due to not meeting targets for the company s bonus plan 
lower sales commission expenses were due to lower net sales in compared to divestiture in thousands of dollars gain on sale of product line  net on june   the company divested its electrical papers product line business for total consideration of million  of which million was paid on june  as part of the sale transaction  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement and a license agreement with the buyer 
under the manufacturing agreement  the company is obligated to manufacture and sell electrical paper products to the buyer for a two year period 
pursuant to the license agreement  the company granted the buyer the right to use certain process technology and agreed to provide certain services to the buyer to facilitate the transfer of know how for the manufacture of electrical paper products 
under the license agreement  the buyer is obligated to pay the company the additional million on the earlier of june  or completion by lydall of its obligations to provide services to the buyer 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a million gain related to this transaction 
the company recorded a gain on sale of million in the second quarter of  net of a write off of million of goodwill that was allocated to the electrical papers product line 
during the six months ended december   the company also recognized additional income of million  as the company provided services to the buyer in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
the remainder of the gain is being recognized over the period that the company satisfies its obligations under the license agreement 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in thousands of dollars goodwill impairment impairment of long lived assets total impairment the results of the company s annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to the na auto goodwill  included in the thermal acoustical segment  or affinity goodwill  
table of contents included in ops 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill and all of the million of affinity goodwill during the fourth quarter of also  the company recorded an impairment of long lived assets charge of million in the fourth quarter of at the affinity business 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these impairments 
interest expense in thousands of dollars interest expense weighted average interest rate during the year interest expense was higher in compared to due to increased amortization of debt financing costs associated with the company entering into a domestic credit facility in march and increases in unused borrowing fees  partially offset by lower average principal balances on capital lease obligations 
the increase in interest expense for compared to was primarily due to increased amortization of debt financing costs associated with the company entering into a domestic credit facility in march and increases in unused borrowing fees 
other income and expense in thousands of dollars other income  net the amounts included in other income  net  in all years presented are primarily related to net gains and losses from derivative transactions  investment income and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
income taxes from continuing operations revised revised effective income tax rate the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for was compared to in and in for  the company s effective tax rate was significantly impacted by an irc section tax benefit of million associated with a change in assertion regarding unremitted foreign earnings related to its german branch 
this was nearly offset by valuation allowances against certain foreign tax credits  us federal and state net operating losses  and other us net deferred tax assets  which generated tax expense of million in the impact of those two items and a reduction in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits primarily contributed to the company s effective tax rate differing from the statutory federal income tax rate in during the third quarter of  the company elected to change its assertion regarding unremitted foreign earnings related to its german branch 
under this election  the company asserts that undistributed earnings of the branch are no longer indefinitely reinvested but are available for remittance to lydall  inc implementing this change required that the company assume that the assertion was reversed at the beginning of the fiscal year and compute the effect of currency translations from branch inception through january  using exchange rates prevailing during the time that income was earned or remittances were made 
the tax impact of the resulting currency translation adjustment is reflected in the company s effective tax rate and generated a tax benefit of million in this benefit resulted from the german branch having incurred losses during periods of time when the us dollar exchange rates were less favorable compared to the deutsch mark and euro and profits were earned during periods when the us dollar was strong against the euro 
during  the company recorded additional valuation reserves against certain foreign tax credits  federal and state net operating losses  and other us net deferred tax assets  which generated tax expense of million 
the reserves reflect the company s assessment that the future realization of such tax benefits is not reasonably assured 
the company determined it would carry back its taxable loss to prior years 
as a result  at december   an income tax receivable of million was recorded in 
table of contents anticipation of a cash refund expected to be received in this carry back allowed foreign tax credits previously utilized by the company to become available for future use 
an analysis was performed of the expected future realization of these foreign tax credits and credits generated in before their expiration  and as a result  the company recorded an income tax charge of million in to record a valuation allowance on the available foreign tax credits for which their future realization was not reasonably assured 
in addition  the company is in a cumulative three year loss in the us and as a result  a valuation allowance of million was recorded against federal and state net deferred tax assets as of december  an income tax charge in to record valuation allowances on foreign tax credits primarily contributed to the effective tax rate differing from the statutory federal income tax rate in the company determined it would carry back its taxable loss to prior years 
as a result  at december   an income tax receivable of million was recorded in anticipation of a cash refund  which was subsequently received in this carry back allowed foreign tax credits previously utilized by the company to become available for future use 
an analysis was performed of the expected future realization of these foreign tax credits before their expiration  and as a result  the company recorded an income tax charge of million in to record a valuation allowance on the available foreign tax credits for which their future realization was not reasonably assured 
the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million as of december  the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges in  the thermal acoustical segment completed the consolidation of the north american automotive parts production by transferring all production in vermont to its north carolina operation 
the vermont facility manufactured non fiber based products 
in the thermal acoustical segment  the company recorded pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of million over the period of consolidation  including pre tax charges of million in and million in  with over recorded in cost of sales during both periods 
these restructuring activity expenses primarily included severance related expenses  acceleration of depreciation expense on fixed assets that were not transferred to the north carolina facility  and facility exit  moving and set up expenses of equipment transferred from vermont to north carolina 
no cash outflows were made in other than the remaining lease payments on the vermont facility of approximately million  which will continue to be made ratably through the third quarter of total cash outflows for the restructuring program was million in and million in this consolidation reduced operating costs for non fiber based products due to lower fixed overhead and labor costs as a result of closing the vermont facility 
however  these savings were more than offset by the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies for fiber based products at the north carolina facility  which resulted in higher manufacturing costs in

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments about and estimates of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles 
the company had goodwill of million at december  and million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  including related goodwill 
the company s reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that operating segment or component 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors such as market capitalization 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge  which did occur during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of the million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit and million of goodwill in the vital fluids reporting unit  included in ops 
the company s goodwill impairment testing analysis analysis included projecting cash flows for the years and discounting those amounts based on appropriate market risks and other market factors 
based on those projections and other assumptions used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value of net assets 
as a result  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the projected cash flows of the vital fluids reporting unit include assumptions for growth in future years resulting from a strategic initiative to increase market share in the bioprocessing market 
in  the vital fluids business initiated the qualification of products with a number of new customers  however  there is a lengthy period of time required for customer qualification and the expected improved operating results to be realized by the business 
if future operating performance does not meet expectations or other key assumptions change or are not met  there can be no assurance that the fair value of the reporting unit will continue to exceed its carrying value which could potentially result in a non cash impairment charge to income from operations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  including independent appraisals when appropriate  the income approach  which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors 
the company determined that long lived assets at the affinity business were impaired at december  this was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows and independent appraisals for its asset group  which indicated that the fair value was less than their carrying value 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group compared to the carrying value of the asset group see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuary based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
pension plans outside the us are not significant at december  a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of will be utilized for determining pension cost  which is consistent with what was used for calculating pension costs 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company based its discount rate assumption on an analysis which included the selection of a bond portfolio comprised of high quality fixed income investments whose cash flows would provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan 
the discount rate is then developed as the single rate that equates the market value of the bond portfolio to the discounted value of the plan s benefit payments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
pension accounting guidance requires that gains or losses be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in the pension accounting guidance 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for these plans is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently  pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in 
table of contents excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension expense related to its defined benefit plans in the us of million as a result of the expected return on assets being lower than the aggregate of interest cost and the amortization of actuarial loss 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension expense for is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the company contributed million to its us defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company analyzes historical financial results by jurisdiction and estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as returns required by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  france  germany and the netherlands 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal examinations for years before  state and local examinations for years before  and non us income tax examinations for years before in assessing the need for reserves for uncertainties in income taxes recognized  a significant number of estimates and judgments must be made by the company 
the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate was million as of december  unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on the distribution to the united states because it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
if remitted  the additional united states tax liability is not expected to be material 
the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits 
equity compensation plans the company accounts for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognizes such amounts in the statements of operations 
the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures and such estimates of forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
the effect of changes in estimated forfeitures is recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of option grants based on the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility and expected term are based on historical information 
the company believes that future volatility and expected term are not likely to materially differ from the company s historical stock price volatility and historical exercise data  respectively 

table of contents the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended december risk free interest rate expected life years years years expected volatility expected dividend yield recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition 
under this guidance  if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value for each deliverable in an arrangement with multiple elements is not available then the proportion of the selling price attributable to each deliverable may be estimated 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  the company early adopted these standards on april  and retroactively applied these standards as of the beginning of for new and materially modified arrangements originating after december  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income for was approximately million higher than operating income would have been under the previous accounting rules 
in january  the fasb issued guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
other key financial items cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  compared with million as of december  this increase of million was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities of million  including tax refunds of million  which was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash used for financing activities of million 
investing activities included million used for capital expenditures offset by million of proceeds from a sale of a product line 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in cash decreasing by million in compared to accounts receivable accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful receivables  were million at the end of compared with million at the end of this increase was primarily related to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in inventories inventories were million as of december  compared with million as of december  primarily contributing to this increase was higher raw materials and work in process inventories net of progress billing on tooling inventories of million and million  respectively 
these increases were the result of greater production activity in reaction to improving market conditions and demand for the company s products 
contributing to the increase in work in process inventories was an increase in automotive tooling inventory  net  which was million greater at december  compared to december  the company made significant cash investments in tooling inventory during in preparation of launches of new automotive platforms in the latter part of and in current liabilities current liabilities increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the largest components of the increase were related to higher accounts payable of million and accrued payroll and other compensation of million 
the increase in accounts payable was primary driven by the timing of inventory purchases 
as a result of greater customer demand for products  the company s level of inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of was significantly higher than the comparable quarter of higher accrued payroll and other compensation was due to the timing of payroll as well as higher headcount and greater production labor hours in the last weeks of december compared to december also  as a result of meeting certain financial targets in the company s bonus plan  accrued incentive compensation was recorded at december   compared to when no incentive compensation was accrued at december

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lydall s limited market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk lydall has sales and manufacturing activities in foreign countries 
as a result  financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets where the company distributes its products 
the company s primary currency exposure is to the euro and  to a lesser degree  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
lydall s foreign and domestic operations limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in local functional currencies whenever practicable 
in addition  lydall periodically enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure to foreign currency volatility 
lydall utilizes bank loans and other debt instruments throughout its operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  such debt is denominated primarily in the functional currency of the operation maintaining the debt 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate exposure is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates in the united states and europe  which impact interest paid on its debt 
at december   the company had no loans or borrowings on lines of credit outstanding with variable interest rates  therefore  a change in the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt would not have any impact to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the weighted average interest rate paid on variable debt was in and in at no time during did the company have any borrowings with variable interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on long term debt was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively
