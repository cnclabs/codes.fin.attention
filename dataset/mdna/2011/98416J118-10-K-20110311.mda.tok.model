item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the section titled risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
recent developments global economic environment our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
beginning in and continuing through most of  the global paper industry experienced a sharp reduction in production levels  caused by the general slowdown in economic activity and related paper consumption during the same period and the paper manufacturers reducing excessive inventories 
the slowdown of production was across most grades of paper production  but most notably in packaging and newsprint grades 
for packaging grades  demand is directly related to broad manufacturing and transportation activity reduction  while newsprint demand has been declining over a number of years due to the greater prevalence of electronic media  exacerbated during the recession by a reduction in print advertising 
one of the results of this recession driven reduction in demand for paper products was that the paper manufacturers dramatically and quickly reduced production through curtailments of machines and complete mill shutdowns 
these curtailments  which began in late  served to reduce inventories and match output with demand 
by early  most mills and equipment not permanently shuttered had resumed production 
in  however  global paper and board production began to recover  particularly in developing countries 
as international shipments of manufactured goods recovered  containerboard production recovered particularly strongly  contributing over of the total global improvement  though the rate of recovery slowed somewhat during the second half of going forward  we expect that global paper and board manufacturers operating rates will remain near their current high levels as capacity keeps pace with production  which may have a positive impact on the demand for some of our products 
while there continues to be price pressure due to our competitors pursuing increased market share in  as compared with  we were successful in increasing our pricing levels in our roll covers segment and maintaining them relatively constant in our clothing segment 
overview we are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper clothing and roll covers 
our operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of north america  europe  south america and asia pacific 
our products play key roles in the formation and processing of paper along the length of a paper making machine 
paper producers rely on our products and services to help improve the quality of their paper  differentiate their paper products  operate their paper making machines more efficiently and reduce production costs 
our products and services typically represent only a small fraction of a paper producer s overall production costs  yet they reduce costs by permitting the use of lower cost raw materials and reducing energy consumption 
paper producers must replace clothing and refurbish or replace roll covers regularly as these products wear down during the paper production process 
our products are designed to withstand extreme temperature  chemical and pressure conditions  and are the result of a substantial investment in research and development and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes 
we operate in two principal business segments clothing and roll covers 
in our clothing segment  we manufacture and sell highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed on a paper making machine 
clothing plays a significant role in the forming  pressing and drying stages of paper production 
because paper making processes and machine specifications vary widely  the clothing size  form  material and function is selected to fit each individual paper making machine and process 
in  our clothing segment represented of our net sales 

table of contents our roll cover products provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper sheet in a cost effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer 
roll covers are tailored to each individual paper making machine and process  using different materials  treatments and finishings 
in addition to manufacturing and selling new roll covers  we also provide refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers and manufacture spreader rolls 
additionally  we provide various related products and services to our customers  both directly and through third party providers  as a growing part of our overall product offering through our roll covers sales channels 
in  our roll cover segment represented of our net sales 
in  net sales in other industrial applications outside of the paper industry  such as steel  plastics and textiles  accounted for approximately and of the net sales in our clothing segment and roll covers segment  respectively 
industry trends and outlook historically  demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis 
we expect the growth of global paper production from to to be between and per annum 
generally  and over time  we expect growth in paper production to be greater in asia pacific  south america and eastern europe than in the more mature north american and western european regions where demand may potentially decline 
between  especially the latter part of the year  and  the global paper industry experienced a sharp reduction in production levels  caused by the general slowdown in economic activity and related paper consumption during the same period 
in  however  global paper and board production began to recover from the economic recession and show growth  particularly in developing countries 
we believe that our increase in net sales volume in as compared with reflects this ongoing recovery as well as the success of our new products the profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper  driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires 
a sustained downturn in the paper industry  either globally or in a particular region  can cause paper manufacturers to reduce production or cease operations  which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability 
since  paper producers have taken actions that seek to structurally improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper 
as part of these efforts  they have permanently shut down many paper making machines or entire manufacturing facilities 
papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability  and we believe that further consolidation among papermakers  reducing the number of paper producers  and shutdowns of paper making machines or facilities will occur in europe and north america  until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve 
this rebalancing has been accelerated during the current global economic recession 
over a number of years  consumption growth of paper  particularly in south america and asia pacific  is expected to drive an increase in the global production rates required to maintain balance between supply and demand 
it is highly likely  however  that a consumption slow down and related effect on global paper production will continue in the near term  exacerbated by the recent global economic recession 
also affecting machine curtailments are structural productivity gains from improved products that we and our competitors supply 
global paper production growth that does occur would be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity that is a continuing underlying trend in north america and western europe 
we also believe that  in addition to industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north america and western europe  the trend towards new paper machine designs which have fewer rolls and market recognition of extended life of our roll cover products has been and will continue to negatively impact demand for these products and that the volume potential for the roll covers business may slowly diminish  offset by our introduction of new products and increasing market share of proprietary products such as our smartroll 
additionally  we are seeing a trend that paper producers are placing an increasing emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and  as a result  are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them 

table of contents we anticipate that pricing pressure for our products will continue with the consolidation among paper producers and as the shift of paper production growth in asia pacific develops 
in response to this pricing pressure  we expect to increase our expenditure levels on research and development  and continue to enhance and deploy our value added selling approach as part of our strategy to differentiate our products  while at the same time we remain focused on cost reduction and efficiency programs 
the negative paper industry trends described above are likely to continue 
though an economic recovery appears to be underway  we believe that the paper industry will experience increased emphasis on cost reduction  continued paper machine shutdown activity  and reduced availability of credit than would have been the case in the absence of the economic downturn 
these industry dynamics could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
net sales and expenses net sales in both our clothing and roll covers segments are primarily driven by the following factors the volume of worldwide paper production  advances in the technology of our products  which can provide value to our customers by improving the efficiency of paper making machines and reduce our manufacturing costs  our ability to provide products and services which reduce paper making machine downtime  while at the same time allowing the manufacture of high quality paper products  and the impact of currency fluctuations 
net sales in our roll covers segment include our mechanical services business 
we have expanded this business in response to demand from paper producers that we perform work on the internal mechanisms of a roll while we refurbish or replace a roll cover 
in our clothing segment  a small portion of our business has been conducted pursuant to consignment arrangements under which we do not recognize a sale of a product to a customer until the customer places the product into use  which typically occurs some period after the product is shipped to the customer or to a warehouse location near the customer s facility 
we are striving to reduce the number of consignment arrangements and increase the use of standard terms of sale under which we recognize a sale upon product shipment 
we expect this effort to be successful over the next several years 
our operating costs are primarily driven by total sales volume  the impact of inflation  foreign currency fluctuations and the level and impact of cost reduction programs 
the level of our cost of products sold is primarily attributable to labor costs  raw material costs  product shipping costs  plant utilization and depreciation  with labor costs constituting the largest component 
we invest in facilities and equipment that enable innovative product development and improve production efficiency and costs 
recent examples of capital spending for such purposes include faster weaving looms and seaming machines with accurate electronic controls  automated compound mixing equipment and computer controlled lathes and mills 
the level of research and development spending is driven by market demand for technology enhancements  including both specific customer needs and general market requirements  as well as by our own analysis of applied technology opportunities 
with the exception of purchases of equipment and similar capital items used in our research and development activities  all research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange we have a geographically diverse customer base 
in  approximately of our net sales was in north america  was in europe  was in south america  was in asia pacific and was in the rest of the world 

table of contents a substantial portion of our net sales is denominated in euros or other currencies 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect our reported levels of net sales and profitability as the results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
in particular  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the euro and these other currencies negatively impact our levels of revenue and profitability because the translation of a certain number of euros or units of such other currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent fewer us dollars 
for certain transactions  our net sales are denominated in us dollars but all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in a different currency 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies can affect the level of the profitability of these transactions 
the largest proportion of such transactions consist of transactions in which the net sales are denominated in or indexed to us dollars and all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in euros  reals or other currencies 
currency fluctuations have a greater effect on the level of our net sales than on the level of our income loss from operations 
for example  in as compared to  the change in the value of the us dollar against most of the currencies we conduct our business in resulted in net currency decreases in net sales and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
although the results reflect a period in which the value of the us dollar increased against the euro as compared to  we would expect an opposite effect in a period in which the value of the us dollar decreases 
during  we conducted business in foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average exchange rate in and of the us dollar against each of the four foreign currencies in which we conduct the largest portion of our operations 
currency average exchange rate of the us dollar in average exchange rate of the us dollar in euro euro euro brazilian real brazilian real brazilian real canadian dollar canadian dollar canadian dollar australian dollar australian dollar australian dollar over the last two years  approximately of our operations have been conducted in euros  approximately in the brazilian real although a significant portion of brazil net sales are in us dollars and approximately in the canadian dollar 
to mitigate the risk of transactions in which a sale is made in one currency and associated costs are denominated in a different currency  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain that results from the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedge strategy 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
due to reduced credit limits at some of our banks  we have been entering into fewer foreign currency hedging arrangements than we had historically and may not be able to enter into as many hedging arrangements in the future 
as a result  our financial statements are more exposed to the effects of currency fluctuations  both favorable and unfavorable  which could have a material impact on our results of operations

cost reduction programs an important part of our strategy is to seek to reduce our overall costs and improve our competitiveness 
as a part of this effort  we engage in cost reduction programs  which are designed to improve the cost structure of our global operations in response to changing market conditions 
these cost reduction programs include headcount reductions throughout the world as well as plant closures that have rationalized production among our facilities to better enable us to meet customer demands 
our cost reduction efforts between and included the closing of manufacturing facilities 
during this same period  our headcount was lowered by almost individuals as a result of these actions 
in  we charged a total of million to restructuring and impairments expense related to the continual streamlining of our operating structure  the closing of our roll covers manufacturing facilities in sherbrooke  canada and sweden  and our plan to cease production in australia and to discontinue construction of our vietnam facility 
in  we charged a total of million to restructuring and impairments expense related to the continual streamlining of our operating structure and asset impairments  partially offset by a gain on sale of our rolls manufacturing facility in sweden 
we incurred restructuring expenses of approximately million in the aggregate during  primarily related to the north bay  ontario closure  the closure of a rolls plant in germany  asset impairment charges in vietnam and to headcount reductions resulting from the integration of the regional management structure in north america and europe 
we expect to continue to review our business to determine if additional actions can be taken to further improve our cost structure 
we estimate restructuring expenses of approximately to million during  primarily related to a continuation of streamlining our operating structure

selling expenses 
for the year ended december   selling expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million related to increased headcount and salaries and higher sales commissions as a result of higher sales volumes during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  and unfavorable currency effects of million related to the translation of expenses made in foreign currencies to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was approximately half due to the result of gains recorded in that were absent in such as i a million reversal that was recorded in for environmental expense related to remediation costs in australia  ii a million decrease that was recorded in in litigation accruals for brazilian labor matters and other legal matters  and iii a million decrease that was recorded in in provisions for doubtful accounts based on collections and lower reserves required for certain north american customers who had filed for bankruptcy

for the most part  restructuring expenses resulted from our long term strategy to reduce costs and improve long term competitiveness as described above under cost reduction programs by closing and or transferring production from certain of our manufacturing facilities and through headcount reductions 
for the year ended december   restructuring expenses consisted of severance costs  facility costs and asset impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill impairment 
there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended december  as of december   we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million related to our roll covers segment based on assessments performed at that date 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other intangible assets topic we are required to test goodwill at least annually for impairment  which we do each year at december applying the guidance in topic  we determined that as of december   goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired primarily due to the adverse effect of our credit issues and the effects of the current global economic environment 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is 
table of contents primarily attributable to the termination of all of our interest rate swaps on december   which carried fixed interest rates that were higher than variable interest rates and to lower interest expense due to lower debt balances under the amended and restated credit facility 
partially offsetting the decreases is million during the year ended december  as compared with million during the year ended december  from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense 
these amounts represent the mark to market changes in the swaps in and the amortization in of the balance remaining in other comprehensive income relating to these swaps

on december   that required an interest rate that is in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during the fourth quarter of and c the million increase to interest expense in as compared with in connection with the change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps 
in  the ineffective portion of the mark to market change on two of our interest rate swap hedges has been charged to interest expense and  effective september   we lost hedge accounting for all of our interest rate swaps and recorded the mark to market change in their fair value of million as a charge to interest expense 
during  the swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting for the first half of the year  which resulted in a credit to interest expense for the change in their fair value for the first six months of these increases were partially offset by favorable currency effects of million 
foreign exchange gain loss 
for  we had a foreign exchange loss of million compared to a foreign exchange gain of million for the gain in was primarily attributable to mark to market gains on fair value hedges  including gains on hedges for which the underlying foreign exchange exposure on certain intercompany debt no longer existed in the first quarter of  and gains on hedges on future purchases of equipment 
the net foreign exchange loss during was primarily the result of hedging and intercompany activity 
provision for income taxes 
for and  the provision for income taxes was million and million  respectively 
the increase in tax was principally due to i losses that were incurred domestically and in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no corresponding tax benefit was recognized as the net operating losses that were created for tax purposes in these jurisdictions were fully reserved for book purposes  and ii the establishment in of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million in canada  million in china and million in the united kingdom and iii curtailment settlement gains recorded in relating to the us retiree plans of million for which no taxes were reflected due to the us deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for debt service  working capital and capital expenditures 
we plan to use unrestricted cash on hand  cash generated by operations and  should it become necessary  access our revolving credit facility and local credit lines  as primary sources of liquidity 
our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
demand for our products could decline if paper manufacturers 
table of contents are unable to obtain required financing or future market conditions cause additional mill closures or inventory build up 
these factors could impact our liquidity and our ability to satisfy the covenant requirements of our credit facility 
in late and early  our liquidity and capital resources were constrained by our non compliance with the terms of our pre petition credit facility and subsequent prepackaged chapter proceedings 
as previously disclosed  prior to the filing of our chapter petitions on march   we were not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under our pre petition credit facility for the quarters ended september  and december  from september   waiver fees were paid to the lenders and the outstanding balance under the pre petition credit facility bore interest at a rate that was per year in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during that period under the facility 
on march   we and certain of our certain of our subsidiaries filed for chapter protection 
see chapter filing  emergence and plan of reorganization for further information regarding our chapter proceedings 
upon our emergence from chapter on may   our amended and restated credit facility and exit facility replaced our pre petition credit facility 
see credit facilities for further discussion of our current credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items during the year ended december  the increase in was after a reduction of cash reorganization items of approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million decrease in as compared with is principally attributable to a decrease in the volume of business as a result of the global economic recession and an increase in working capital during as compared with principally due to the level of payment of payables and accruals during we typically defer payments to certain vendors at the end of each quarter  which results in an increased cash position at the end of the quarter and increased net cash from operating activities for the period then ended 
such deferrals were significant at december  and the reduction of such deferrals at december  contributed to the increase in working capital for the year 
in an effort to improve working capital  in the second quarter of  we initiated a project to accelerate accounts receivable collections and to sell excess inventories 
as of december   our efforts under this project contributed approximately million in additional cash and increased adjusted ebitda by approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to million of restricted cash that we are required to have as collateral for letters of credit under the amended and restated credit facility in and a million increase in capital equipment expenditures during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in as compared with was primarily due to a decrease in capital equipment spending of million in as compared with net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  the fluctuation of million was primarily the result of i borrowings under our dip facility of million during the year ended december  and ii lower debt payments of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to a mandatory principal prepayment of million in based on the excess cash calculation as defined in the pre petition credit agreement 
no such payment was required in partially offsetting this increase in cash provided by financing activities was borrowings of million under our pre petition revolver during and million of expenses related to initiatives undertaken to resolve our credit issues during the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in as compared with was primarily the result of 
table of contents i borrowings under our revolver of million during the first quarter of  and ii the decrease in other financing activities of million in as compared with related to expenses associated with initiatives undertaken to resolve our credit issues 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net debt payments of approximately million during as compared with we made mandatory principal repayments of million during for as compared with million during for 
the increase in the mandatory payment was due to our prior senior credit facility requiring us to make such excess payments based on the prior year s adjusted ebitda  which was impacted during by gains of approximately million related to the freezing of one of our us pension plans  the termination of our us retiree medical plan and the mark to market changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps  partially offset by approximately million related to increased restructuring expenses and increased non cash reserves 
because none of these events generated any cash but increased adjusted ebitda which increased the mandatory principal payment  the effect of these actions reduced our available cash 
we also made a voluntary debt repayment of million during and none in and as of december   there was a million balance of term loans outstanding under our senior credit facility  after making the first two scheduled quarterly payments of million in the third and fourth quarters of the loans included million under our first lien facility and million under a second lien facility 
in addition  as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our current revolving lines of credit  including the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility and lines of credit in various foreign countries that are used to facilitate local short term operating needs 
an aggregate of million is available for additional borrowings under these revolving lines of credit 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  at december  we also had million of restricted cash which is classified as a current asset 
the restricted cash serves as collateral for letters of credit and no letter of credit has a maturity greater than one year  although certain of them can be renewed for another year 
the cash collateral is held in custody by the issuing bank  is restricted as to withdrawal or use and is currently invested in money market funds 
income from these funds is paid to us 
based on current facts and assumptions  we expect our cash tax payments to be less than income tax expense in  and due to the creation of certain deferred tax liabilities and the continued availability of tax loss carry forwards 
capital expenditures we use the term capital expenditures to refer to costs incurred to purchase or significantly upgrade property and equipment 
the majority of our capital expenditures relate to purchases of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products 
capital expenditures were funded from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of growth capital expenditures of million and maintenance capital expenditures of million 
growth capital expenditures consist of items that are intended to increase the manufacturing  production and or distribution capacity or efficiencies of our operations in conjunction with the execution of our business strategies 
maintenance capital expenditures are designed to sustain the current capacity or efficiency of our operations and include items relating to the renovation of existing manufacturing or service facilities  the purchase of machinery and equipment for safety and environmental needs and information technology 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 

table of contents in the first quarter of we began an effort to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
as part of this effort  we determined to delay the planned capital expenditures for the vietnam facility and cancelled or rescheduled certain other previously planned capital expenditures 
these cancellations did not result in any substantial penalties for us 
in december  we discontinued the construction of the vietnam facility  and continue to have some contractual obligations with respect to certain equipment which was previously ordered for the facility 
we have redeployed this equipment to other locations 
we target capital expenditures for to be approximately million and currently estimate capital expenditure levels for to be approximately million 
we analyze our planned capital expenditures based on investment opportunities available to us and our financial and operating performance  and accordingly  actual capital expenditures may be more or less than these amounts

table of contents off balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have did not engage in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have formal accounting policies in place including those that address critical and complex accounting areas 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report identifies the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
derivatives and hedging 
effective january   we adopted asc topic  transition and effective date related to fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
topic for disclosure related to derivatives and hedging 
topic amends and expands the disclosure requirements to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
topic requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
as required by asc topic  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or if we elect not to apply hedge accounting under topic there are two types of hedges into which we enter hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset or liability  or a firm commitment 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability 
changes in derivative fair values are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets and liabilities 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
prior to september   the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualified as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives was recognized directly in earnings 
the balance 
table of contents in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of august  related to the interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued was subsequently reclassified into the statement of operations interest expense over the remaining original term of the derivative as the hedged forecasted transactions are also recorded to interest expense  in accordance with topic in addition  as of march   we determined that it was probable that future interest payments on the debt that was in excess of the million discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements would not occur 
as a result  we reclassified an additional million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense  which represented the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to interest payments on the debt that was in excess of million 
as of march   after this reclassification  the remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps was amortized to interest expense through december   the original term of the swaps 
accordingly  during  we amortized approximately million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense 
on december   we terminated with the counterparties all of our outstanding interest rate swap liabilities of million and converted them into notes payable to such counterparties 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings effective september   prior to their termination with the counterparties  they effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective through december   the interest rate at on approximately of the term loan portion of our pre petition credit facility 
as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility was no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 
we have measured our derivative assets and liabilities under asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures topic  and have classified our interest rate swaps in level of the topic fair value hierarchy  as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on market observable data or information derived from or corroborated by market observable data  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  and correlations of such inputs 
for our derivatives  all of which traded in liquid markets  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
to comply with the provisions of topic  we incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives 
the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty s credit spread to the applicable exposure 
for derivatives with two way exposure  such as interest rate swaps  the counterparty s credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty  and our own credit spread is applied to the counterparty s exposure to us  and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations 
the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using market observable inputs  such as yield curves and volatilities 
the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from its publicly traded debt 
for counterparties with publicly available credit information  the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
additionally  we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level 
table of contents inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
we do not have any fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level as of december  however  as of december   the credit valuation adjustments have had no impact on the overall valuation of our derivative positions as we terminated all of our outstanding interest rate swaps with the counterparties on december  various factors which impact changes in the credit are not significant to the overall valuation adjustments over time  including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts  as well as changes in market rates and volatilities  which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments 
goodwill 
we account for acquired goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  business combinations topic 
purchase accounting required by topic involves judgment with respect to the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities in order to determine the amount of goodwill 
we have recorded our acquisitions in accordance with topic impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with topic  which requires considerable judgment in the valuation of acquired goodwill and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill impairment 
topic requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but  instead  must be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or business conditions warrant 
we perform annual tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are clothing and roll covers 
when our business was acquired in  more than of the goodwill was assigned to the roll covers reporting unit based on relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test  we allocate all shared assets and liabilities to the reporting units based upon the percentage of each reporting unit s revenue to total revenue 
shared expenses are allocated to each reporting unit to the extent necessary to allow them to operate as independent businesses 
fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of both a market multiple approach and an income approach 
the market multiple approach utilizes our and our competitors information to determine measures that are used to value our reporting units 
the income approach is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under topic are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
based on the assessments performed as of december   we determined that no impairment of goodwill exists 
the excess of the fair value over carrying value for our clothing and roll covers segment as of december   the annual test date  was approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of the business segments  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million and million for the clothing segment and the roll covers segment  respectively 

table of contents as of december   we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million related to our roll covers reporting unit based on assessments performed as of that date 
applying the guidance of topic  we determined that as of december   goodwill for the roll covers reporting unit was impaired primarily due to the adverse effect of our credit issues and the effects of the global economic environment at that time 
step of the process indicated that the fair value of the net assets of the roll covers reporting unit was million less than their carrying value as of december  based on the step result  we proceeded with step based on the increase in fair value of tangible and intangible assets over book value of million as determined in step  an aggregate impairment of million was recorded in the roll covers reporting unit 
to date  there have been no indicators of impairment or recorded goodwill impairment for our clothing reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing reporting unit as of december  was approximately million 
contingencies 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax  environmental and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with asc topic  contingencies 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters 
for example  during the third quarter of  while evaluating our facility in australia  we discovered the possibility of contamination at the facility 
subsequently we had a preliminary evaluation performed  which confirmed the existence of contamination and estimated preliminary costs to remediate this facility 
based upon this evaluation  we accrued million in as our best estimate of the remediation costs we expected to incur 
a phase ii assessment of the groundwater contamination performed for us during the second quarter of indicated the costs to remediate the contamination would be significantly less than originally estimated and accordingly  we reduced the accrual by million during the second quarter of based on this assessment 
at the end of the second quarter of  we entered into a contingent purchase and sale agreement with a third party whereby the third party could purchase the australian facility after two years from the date of the purchase and sale agreement 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  the environmental liability would transfer to the third party at the time of such purchase 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes topic 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in light of our accumulated loss position in certain tax jurisdictions  and the uncertainty of taxability in future periods  we recorded a valuation allowance against all u 
s 
deferred tax assets and against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards in australia  canada  germany  sweden  the united kingdom and france 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and rely on estimates and assumptions 
these audits may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
with 
table of contents respect to all jurisdictions  we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties and that no unresolved issues or claims are likely to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we adopted the uncertain tax provisions of topic on january  asc topic relates to uncertain tax positions and prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we have a net deferred tax liability of million at december  and million at december  the net deferred tax liability relates principally to pension and post retirement benefits  intangible assets and differences between the book and tax bases of property and equipment 
our balance sheet as of december reflects a deferred tax asset related to our german federal and trade loss carry forwards of approximately million 
as a general rule  federal and trade tax loss carry forwards are subject to forfeiture if more than of the shares in the corporation are directly or indirectly transferred to a new shareholder 
there is a restructuring exception to this general rule  however  effective december  this exception has been suspended with retroactive effect 
as of december  we have impaired the portion of the deferred tax asset we believe to be subject to possible forfeiture 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations except for argentina  brazil and mexico 
to the extent earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested  no provision for income taxes or withholding taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to both income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various jurisdictions 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability or withholding taxes is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards would be available to reduce some portion of the liability 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable 
non gaap liquidity measures we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined in the amended and restated credit facility as supplementary non gaap liquidity measures to assist us in evaluating our liquidity and financial performance  specifically our ability to service indebtedness and to fund ongoing capital expenditures 
the amended and restated credit facility includes covenants based on adjusted ebitda 
if our adjusted ebitda declines below certain levels  we may violate the covenants resulting in a default condition under the credit facility or be required to prepay the credit facility 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income loss from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  income tax provision benefit and depreciation including non cash impairment charges and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined in the amended and restated credit facility as the total of a consolidated net income  as defined below  plus b  without duplication  to the extent that any of the following were deducted in computing consolidated net income i provision for taxes based on income or profits

notwithstanding the foregoing  adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of was fixed in the amended and restated credit agreement at million 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit facility and calculated below  may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies 
consolidated net income is defined as net income loss determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap  provided  however  that the following  without duplication  shall be excluded in determining consolidated net income i any net after tax extraordinary or non recurring gains  losses or expenses less all fees and expenses relating thereto  ii the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  iii any fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with the issuance or repayment of indebtedness  any refinancing transaction or amendment or modification of any debt instrument  in each case  as permitted under the amended and restated credit facility and iv any gains resulting from the returned surplus assets of any pension plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging 
we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale and intercompany debt transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to these exposures  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our net sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
the value of these contracts is recognized at fair value based on market exchange forward rates and amounted to a net liability position of  at december  these contracts mature at various dates through may as of december   we had open foreign currency exchange contracts maturing through may with total net notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   we prepared an analysis to determine the sensitivity of our forward foreign exchange contracts to changes in exchange rates 
a hypothetical adverse exchange rate movement of against our forward foreign exchange contracts would have resulted in a potential net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
any gain or loss recognized on a foreign exchange contract would generally be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying hedge transaction 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes may affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
for additional information about the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange 
interest rate hedging 
our current and pre petition credit facilities have variable interest rates 
in connection with our pre petition credit facility  we previously entered into interest rate swap arrangements pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor  euribor or cdor rates 
on december   we terminated with the counterparties all of our outstanding interest rate swap liabilities of million and converted them into notes payable to such counterparties 
prior to their termination with the counterparties  the interest rate swaps effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our pre petition credit facility through december  at 
as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the pre petition credit facility was no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 
under our amended and restated credit facility  the applicable margin for our libor term loans  euribor loans and cdor loans is for the million term loans and for the million term loan and libor revolving loans under the exit facility  both with a libor floor of 
as previously discussed  we terminated our outstanding interest rate swaps at december  and have not entered into any new interest rate swap agreements since that time 
consequently  our financial statements are exposed to the effects of interest rate fluctuations  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  under the amended and restated credit facility  the cdor rate  the libor rate and the euribor rate are subject to a minimum base rate of per annum  which is currently higher than the respective base rates of  and  respectively 
we do not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in these base rates would affect our interest expense
