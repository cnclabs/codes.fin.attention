further  we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
overview we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases 
our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents  or vdas  that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions 
to date  more than subjects have been treated with zybrestat  our lead candidate  in human clinical trials  and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well tolerated 
zybrestat for oncology fact fosbretabulin in anaplastic cancer of the thyroid trial phase study with zybrestat in anaplastic thyroid cancer atc in earlier phase studies of zybrestat in anaplastic thyroid cancer  or atc  clinical investigators observed several objective responses in treatment with zybrestat  including a complete response lasting more than years  in patients with atc 
a subsequent phase study in atc patients showed a rate 
table of contents of one year survival in a disease where median expected survival of patients is approximately months from the time of diagnosis and fewer than of patients are typically alive at one year 
based on this encouraging data  we completed a special protocol assessment  or spa  process with the fda in  for a phase study  which we refer to as the fact trial  in which zybrestat was to be evaluated in patients as a potential treatment for atc 
atc is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options 
zybrestat was awarded orphan drug status by the fda and the european commission in the european union for the treatment of advanced atc and for the treatment of medullary  stage iv papillary and stage iv follicular thyroid cancers 
the fda also granted fast track designation to zybrestat for the treatment of regionally advanced and or metastatic atc 
the primary endpoint for the fact trial is overall survival 
eligible patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed atc were randomized either to the treatment arm of the study  in which they received zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel  or to the control arm of the study  in which they received only carboplatin and paclitaxel 
central pathology review by external pathologists not associated with the study was utilized to confirm the histological diagnosis 
the fact trial began enrolling patients in a total of clinical sites in countries participated in this clinical study  which was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the spa 
due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that most of the patients screened for the study either progressed or no longer met the trial s inclusion criteria  the enrollment period spanned more than twice the planned month period 
as a result of both the length of the enrollment period and financial constraints affecting the company  in february  we chose to continued to treat and follow all patients who were enrolled in the phase fact clinical trial in atc in accordance with the spa  but to stop further enrollment 
initial data from this trial was presented at both the th international thyroid congress on september  in paris  france and the th european society of medical oncology congress on october  in milan  italy 
at these meetings  we reported data suggesting a benefit in overall survival in patients receiving zybrestat in combination with chemotherapy 
of particular note was the fact that the one year survival rate was doubled for patients receiving zybrestat 
the additional data we presented in october also included some subgroup analyses that confirmed the overall survival benefit and also indicated that zybrestat improved the survival of patients with the most advanced stages of the disease  as well as patients who had been heavily pretreated with surgery  radiation or chemotherapy 
data from an additional event driven survival analysis among the enrolled patients are anticipated in the first half of the fda has been informed that enrollment in this study was halted at patients and that we expected that the spa would no longer be applicable 
the orphan drug status and the expedited review designations have not been affected by the halted enrollment in the phase study 
we requested a meeting with the fda to discuss the results of this study and a potential path forward in light of the data from this study 
in february the fda notified us that it would meet with the company on march  falcon fosbretabulin in advanced lung oncology trial randomized  controlled phase study with zybrestat in non small cell lung cancer we are currently evaluating zybrestat in a patient  randomized  controlled phase clinical trial  which we refer to as the falcon trial  as a potential first line treatment for non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
in the falcon trial  patients are randomized either to the treatment arm of study  in which they receive zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents  carboplatin and paclitaxel  and bevacizumab  a drug that interferes with blood vessel growth  or angiogenics  or to the control arm of the study  in which they receive a standard combination regimen of carboplatin  paclitaxel and bevacizumab 
we believe this study will suggest a benefit of zybrestat in nsclc therapy 
we further believe that these data could be used to design a pivotal registration program with zybrestat in nsclc and more generally  provide clinical validation supporting further evaluation of zybrestat in combination with commonly used anti angiogenic therapeutics that act by selectively inhibiting a particular blood vessel growth path  namely  the vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  pathway 

table of contents on june   we reported updated safety and clinical activity data from the falcon trial at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco 
the updated analysis showed that for the patients treated in this study as of the date of the analysis  meaningful improvements were observed in response rate  progression free survival and overall survival rates in the study arm zybrestat combined with bevacizumab and carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy as compared with the control arm bevacizumab and chemotherapy of the trial 
the combination regimen including zybrestat was observed to be well tolerated with no significant cumulative toxicities when compared with the control arm of the study 
on june   we announced the completion of enrollment in the falcon trial 
we presented an update of the safety and clinical activity data for this trial at the european organization for research and treatment of cancer symposium in november in berlin  germany 
the combination regimen including zybrestat was again observed to be well tolerated with no significant cumulative toxicities when compared with the control arm of the study 
we expect to present the overall survival data from this study at the asco meeting in june zybrestat in ovarian cancer on june   results from a phase trial with zybrestat in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents  carboplatin and paclitaxel  in recurrent  platinum resistant ovarian cancer  were presented at asco 
we believe the results of this study support further development of zybrestat in ovarian cancer and we are considering options for undertaking further randomized  controlled studies in ovarian cancer 
based on the results of this phase study  in february we announced that we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with the national cancer institute s nci cancer therapy evaluation program ctep to collaborate on the conduct of a randomized phase trial of zybrestat in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer 
we will provide zybrestat to nci for an nci sponsored study conducted by the gynecologic oncology group gog  an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer 
the aim of the trial will be to determine if the combination of zybrestat and bevacizumab will enhance anti tumor effects and further delay tumor progression when compared to bevacizumab alone 
we anticipate that investigators will initiate enrollment in this phase study in the first half of the primary endpoint of the study will be progression free survival  with results expected to become available in early possible areas for future development we believe that  if successful  the ongoing zybrestat for oncology program will establish a compelling rationale for further development of zybrestat as a treatment for aggressive and difficult to treat solid tumors  use in combination with chemotherapy in a variety of solid tumors  particularly those in which carboplatin and or paclitaxel chemotherapy are commonly used  and use in combination with commonly used drugs  such as bevacizumab  that interfere with blood vessel growth  or angiogenics  in various solid tumor indications 
we believe these areas for potential further development collectively represent a significant unmet medical need and thus a significant potential commercial market opportunity that includes cancers of the thyroid  ovary  kidney  liver  head and neck  breast  lung  skin  brain  colon and rectum 
in addition  based upon preclinical results published by our collaborators in the february and september issues of the journal blood  as well as preclinical data presented in april at the annual meeting of the american association of cancer research aacr  we believe that zybrestat and its other vda product candidates  particularly oxi  may also have utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies such as acute leukemias and lymphomas 

table of contents oxi  a unique  second generation vda for oncology indications we are currently pursuing development of oxi  a second generation  dual mechanism vda  as a treatment for certain solid tumor types 
we believe that oxi is differentiated from other vdas by its dual action activity 
our data indicates that in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects  oxi is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects 
we believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other vda drug candidates 
based on data from preclinical studies  we believe that oxi may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the type of enzymes that can facilitate the conversion of oxi to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells 
these tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma  melanoma  and myeloid leukemia 
in preclinical studies  oxi has shown potent anti tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models  both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities 
we have completed a phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors sponsored by clinical research united kingdom 
in collaboration with us  professor gordon rustin and colleagues from the mount vernon cancer research centre  uk and other institutions in the united kingdom  reported positive final data from this study at the asco annual meeting 
in this study  patients with advanced solid tumors who had declined or were unresponsive to standard treatment were treated with escalating doses of oxi partial responses were observed in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and stable disease was observed in patients 
oxi was also observed to be well tolerated in this study 
to date  oxi has been observed to have a manageable side effect profile similar to that of other agents in the vda class  potential single agent clinical activity  and effects on tumor blood flow and tumor metabolic activity  as determined with several imaging modalities 
we also evaluated escalating doses of oxi in an ongoing oxigene sponsored phase b trial  initiated in the first quarter of in patients with solid tumors with hepatic involvement 
this study confirmed the recommended dose established in the first phase study 
patient follow up and final analysis of the data from the latter trial is ongoing 
based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal blood in september that show oxi has potent activity against aml in animal models  we expect that investigators at the university of florida will initiate an investigator sponsored phase study of oxi in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia aml or myelodysplastic syndrome mds in the first half of we expect the open label  dose escalating study for the treatment of up to patients to be conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory aml and mds and will evaluate the safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of oxi in these patients 
we expect that initial indications of biologic activity from this study may be available as early as the first half of the general direction of future development of oxi solid tumors or hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of both the solid tumor studies and the study in aml  as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities 
zybrestat for ophthalmology in addition to developing zybrestat as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications  we have undertaken an ophthalmology research and development program with zybrestat with the ultimate goal of developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision 
previously  we reported results at the annual meeting of the association for research in vision and ophthalmology  or arvo  from a phase study in patients with myopic macular degeneration in which all patients in the study met the primary clinical endpoint of vision stabilization at three months after study entry 
in december  we completed a randomized  double masked  placebo controlled phase proof of mechanism trial  which we refer to as the favor trial  with a single dose of intravenously administered zybrestat in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy pcv  a form of choroidal neovascularization  which is a condition where new blood vessels form in the choroid  a part of the eye  and which can lead to vision loss and  ultimately  blindness 
current therapies  including approved drugs that 
table of contents interfere with blood vessel growth  known as anti angiogenics  appear to provide limited benefit 
we believe that the architecture of the abnormal vasculature in certain eye tissues  namely the retina and choroid  which contribute to pcv patients loss of vision  may be particularly susceptible to treatment with a vda such as zybrestat 
we believe that pcv represents an attractive target indication and development pathway for zybrestat 
unlike wet age related macular degeneration  an indication for which several anti angiogenic drugs are approved or prescribed off label  conducting clinical studies of zybrestat in patients with ophthalmologic indications not yet approved for treatment with such anti angiogenic drugs could potentially prove to reduce development time and expense 
the objectives of the favor trial and the ongoing preclinical program with zybrestat are determine the therapeutic utility of zybrestat in pcv  visualize the effect of zybrestat on the vasculature of the polyps associated with pcv  determine blood concentrations of drug required for activity in humans and thereby estimate  with the benefit of preclinical data  an appropriate dose of topically administered zybrestat to be evaluated in subsequent human clinical studies  and further evaluate the feasibility of developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological indications 
findings from the phase study  including effects on retinal thickness and retinal bleeding  are expected to be presented at a future ophthalmology meeting 
we believe that a safe  effective and convenient topically administered anti vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti vascular  ophthalmological therapeutics  many of which must be injected directly into patients eyes  in some cases on a chronic monthly basis 
for this purpose we have been developing a potential minitab topical formulation of zybrestat which has demonstrated attractive pharmacokinetic and safety properties and efficacy in destroying abnormal vasculature in a rat choroidal melanoma model following administration in the eye 
we believe that a topical formulation would enhance our partnering opportunities to further develop zybrestat in diseases of the eye 
to date  we have completed preclinical testing that indicated that zybrestat has activity in six different preclinical ophthalmology models  including a model in which zybrestat was combined with an approved drug that interferes with blood vessel growth  or anti angiogenic agents 
we have also completed multiple preclinical studies suggesting that zybrestat  when applied topically to the surface of the eye at doses that appear to be well tolerated  penetrates to the retina and choroid in quantities that it believes should be sufficient for therapeutic activity 
we are also evaluating the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with zybrestat for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering 
further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources 
financial resources we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception through december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents on february   we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs 
this restructuring plan was designed to focus our resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
as a part of this restructuring we stopped further enrollment in our phase anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial fact and reduced our work force by approximately employees 
in addition  the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of these ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time 
we incurred a one time charge in connection with the reduction of our work force of approximately  in the first quarter of for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction 
this re alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with reductions in force reduced the cash required to operate our business to between  and  per quarter in the second half of as our current ongoing trials proceed to completion  we expect the per quarter cash requirement to continue to decline to the  to  range over the course of on march   we completed a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell shares of our common stock and four separate series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement 
gross proceeds of the financing were approximately  before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses 
on july   we entered into an at the market atm equity offering sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through mlv acting as our sales agent and underwriter 
sales of our common stock through mlv  are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
mlv uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits we may impose 
we pay mlv a commission rate of up to of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through mlv as agent under the sales agreement 
we have also provided mlv with customary indemnification rights 
from the date of the initial agreement through january  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock with net proceeds of approximately  on january   we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may issue and sell additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to  under the atm 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital  which was subsequently amended in february under the terms of the amended ceff  kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of the company s common stock during the period which ends may  under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement  whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  in  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  for a period of five years thereafter 
as of december   there remain a total of  shares available for sale under the ceff 
we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of assuming that net proceeds from the potential sale of shares at current market prices under the atm sales agreement described above are received ratably over the march to june timeframe  we expect that our existing financial resources  together with the expected net proceeds from the atm  would be sufficient to fund its operations through the second quarter of no assurance can be given that the 
table of contents company will sell any additional shares under the atm sales agreement  or  if it does  as to the price or amount of shares that it will sell  or the dates on which any such sales will take place 
we will require significant additional funding to remain a going concern and to fund operations 
such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to access additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
any additional equity financing  which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms  most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and  if not achieved on a timely basis  will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of independent registered accounting firm at the beginning of the consolidated financial statements section of this form k includes a going concern explanatory paragraph 
the financial statements presented in this form k have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider collaborative development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
however  there can be no assurances that we will complete any strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements  and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us 
we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project by project basis 
we conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
concentration of credit risk we have no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents 
we hold our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution 
cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
we have  that is used to secure financing through a company credit card 
this amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet 
available for sale securities we view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations  and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired  due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery  with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long term assets 
accrued research and development we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts 
costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 
any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered 
license agreements on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
management is required to 
table of contents perform an impairment analysis of its long lived assets if triggering events occur 
we review for such triggering events periodically including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses occurred 
in addition  the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement 
we expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable 
share based compensation we record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term 
stock option exercise price and grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time 
expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends because we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
we are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
accordingly  we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting  and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate 
we segregate participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees  and apply the estimated forfeiture rates using the straight line uniform method to record expense 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate adjusted as necessary 

table of contents symphony transaction in october  we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi in connection with the collaboration  we granted symphony vida  inc  a newly created drug development company  exclusive licenses to zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi under the collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  symphony vida  symphony vida holdings llc holdings and related entities  including a purchase option agreement  a research and development agreement  a technology license agreement and an additional funding agreement 
in addition  we entered into a series of related agreements with holdings  including a stock and warrant purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings formed and capitalized symphony vida in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to the programs which were exclusively licensed to symphony vida under the technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding was intended to support preclinical and clinical development by us  on behalf of symphony vida  of the programs 
we issued to holdings  pursuant to the stock and warrant purchase agreement  an aggregate of  shares of its common stock and warrants at a price of per share  which was the closing price of its common stock on the nasdaq global market on september   the day before we entered into the symphony transaction 
in addition  pursuant to the purchase option agreement  we issued to holdings an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a fair value of  as consideration for the purchase option 
on july   the company  holdings and symphony vida entered into a series of related agreements pursuant to which we exercised the purchase option under terms set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement the amended purchase option agreement  and the company and holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement 
we closed on the amended purchase option on july  and issued  shares of our common stock to holdings at the closing in exchange for all of the equity of symphony vida 
in addition  upon the closing of the purchase option  we re acquired all of the rights to the programs  and the approximately  in cash held by symphony vida at the time of the closing became available for use for general corporate purposes 
consolidation of variable interest entity vie a variable interest entity vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
a vie should be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of accounting policy to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 
we consolidated the financial position and results of operations of symphony vida  inc vida from october  when it entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony vida holdings  llc symphony  until july  when we acquired of vida pursuant to an amended and restated purchase option agreement 
we believe vida was by design a vie because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limited symphony vida holding s returns  as the investor in vida 
further  due to the direct investment from holdings in our common stock  as a related party vida was a vie of which we were the primary beneficiary 
after we exercised the purchase option  vida became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a vie 

table of contents accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests on january   we adopted retrospectively for all periods presented the new presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests required by asc  consolidations 
under asc  earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests are reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense 
accordingly  we reported the consolidated earnings of vida in its consolidated statement of operations from october  when we entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony  until july   when we acquired of the equity of vida pursuant to the amended and restated purchase option agreement 
once becoming our wholly owned subsidiary  the operating results of vida continued to be included in our consolidated statement of operations but were no longer subject to the presentation requirements applicable to noncontrolling interests 
losses incurred by vida  and attributable to symphony  were charged to noncontrolling interest 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in the company s common stock we evaluate all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with our equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the company s financial statements 
the company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment 
the company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment 
the company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards 
in the majority of circumstances  we utilize the black scholes method to determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments 
in some cases  where appropriate  we utilize the binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments 
key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement  the exercise price  the remaining contractual life  expected volatility for the instrument and the risk free interest rate 
changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to the liability on our balance sheet 
the expected volatility factor  in particular  is subject to significant variability from measurement period to measurement period and can result in large gains or losses from period to period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues we did not recognize any license revenue in the years ended december  and  in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology or otherwise 
future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to be minimal

restructuring plan on february   we announced a restructuring plan designed to focus resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
key aspects of the restructuring and its effects on our current clinical trials are as follows we continue to advance our high priority phase zybrestat trial in non small cell lung cancer falcon study  with updated safety and efficacy results anticipated for presentation at the upcoming american society of clinical oncology asco meeting in june we stopped further enrollment in the phase fact clinical trial in anaplastic thyroid cancer atc  but have continued to treat and follow all patients who enrolled in the study 
we expect this approach to optimize our ability to gain useful additional insight into zybrestat s antitumor activity earlier than the previously anticipated timeline  while also reducing cash utilization in and beyond 
we discontinued enrolling patients in our oxi phase b trial in patients with hepatic tumors 
we are evaluating the results received to date 
we discontinued enrollment in our phase favor study of zybrestat in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy pcv  a form of macular degeneration

this resulted in increases in salaries  benefits  recruitment costs and travel costs in fiscal over fiscal in addition  we incurred one time severance expenses of approximately  primarily associated with two executives who departed the company in fiscal the increase in r d headcount described above also contributed to the increase in facilities and related costs of  in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in stock based compensation of  in fiscal from fiscal was as a result of forfeitures of grants by executives and non recurring vesting expense in of restricted stock grants

the net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other payables of  offset in part by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our private placement of common stock and warrants completed in march and the sale of common stock under our at the market equity financing facility discussed below 
on february   we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs 
this restructuring plan is designed to focus our resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
as a part of this restructuring we stopped further enrollment in our phase anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial fact and reduced our work force by approximately employees 
in addition  the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of these ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time 
we incurred a charge in connection with the reduction of our work force of approximately  in the first quarter of for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction 
this re alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with reductions in force reduced the cash required to operate our business to between  and  per quarter in the second half of as our current ongoing trials proceed to completion  we expect the per quarter cash requirement to continue to decline to the  to  range over the course of on march   we completed a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell shares of our common stock and four separate series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement 
gross proceeds of the financing were approximately  before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses  and excluding the subsequent exercises of the warrants 
the four separate series of warrants consisted of the following a series a warrants to initially purchase  shares of common stock  which were exercisable immediately after issuance  had a year term and had an initial per share exercise price of  b series b warrants to initially purchase  shares of common stock  which were initially exercisable at a per share exercise price of  on the earlier of the six month anniversary of the closing date or the date on which our stockholders approve the issuance of shares in the transaction  and expired on the later of three months from the effective date of the resale registration statement covering such shares and seven months from the closing date 
these warrants expired on october   c series c warrants to initially purchase  shares of common stock  and which would be exercisable upon the exercise of the series b warrants and on the earlier of the six month anniversary of the closing date or the date on which our stockholders approve the issuance of shares in the transaction  would expire five years after the date on which they become exercisable  and had an initial per share exercise price of  and d series d warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
the series d warrants were not immediately exercisable 
we registered for resale  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the series d warrants pursuant to an agreement with the warrant holders 
all of the series d warrants were exercised by november  and there are no series d warrants outstanding after that date 
the series a  b and c warrants listed above contained full ratchet anti dilution features based on the price and terms of any financings completed after march  as described in the warrant agreements 
as set forth in the table below  the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the series a  b and c warrants increased substantially and the per share exercise price has decreased substantially  as a result of the operation of these features 
the final number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the series d warrants was determined following two pricing periods  each of no less than seven trading days and no more 
table of contents than thirty trading days  as determined individually by each holder of series d warrants 
the first of these pricing periods occurred from july  to august  the second of these pricing periods occurred from september  to october  the series d warrant provided that if during the applicable pricing period  the arithmetic average of the seven lowest closing bid prices of the common stock as reported on the nasdaq stock market is less than the purchase price in the offering  each holder s series d warrants shall become exercisable for an additional number of shares pursuant to a formula set forth in the purchase agreement 
since the arithmetic average of such prices was below per share during the applicable pricing periods  the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the series d warrants increased substantially as set forth in the table below 
all of the warrants listed above contained a cashless exercise feature as described in the warrant agreements 
the following is a summary of the adjusted number of warrants from the original amounts issued for each of the series of warrants for the year ended december  as a result of the operation of the full ratchet anti dilution provisions of such warrants and the exercise activity in those warrants for the same period in thousands  except for the adjusted exercise price original number of number of adjusted adjusted number of shares issued warrants number of exercise warrants for warrants warrant series issued warrants price exercised exercised series a warrants series b warrants series c warrants series d warrants total on january   we  entered into separate warrant exchange agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in march  pursuant to which  at the initial closing  the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding series a and series c warrants having ratchet price based anti dilution protections for a an aggregate of  shares of common stock and b series e warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series e warrants are not exercisable for six months  have an exercise price of per share reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on january   prior to the entry into the warrant exchange agreements  and do not contain any price based anti dilution protections 
in addition  the company agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to  additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing 
in the event such shareholder approval is obtained  the series e warrants issued at the initial closing shall be exchanged for the additional  shares of common stock 
the initial closing occurred on january   and the subsequent closing is expected to take place on or about march   following the stockholder meeting that has been scheduled for that date to approve the additional share issuance 
our expectation is that the completion of this exchange could enhance the potential to attract additional equity capital as well as help in our efforts to remain compliant with nasdaq listing requirements 
on july   we entered into an at the market atm equity offering sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through mlv acting as our sales agent and underwriter 
sales of our common stock through mlv  are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
mlv uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits we may impose 
we pay mlv a commission rate of up to of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through mlv as agent under the sales agreement 
we have also provided mlv with customary indemnification rights 
during the year ended december   the company sold  shares of common stock pursuant to the atm sales agreement resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately  as of december   there were  shares remaining available for sale under the atm  based on the number of shares registered to be

in january  we sold the remaining  shares resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  on january  we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to  under the atm 
currently  the atm is our only source of capital to enable the continuation of our operations 
on july   we raised approximately  in gross proceeds  before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses  in a registered direct offering relating to the sale of  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock  ii a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock and iii a short term warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock 
the short term warrants are exercisable during a period beginning on the date of issuance until the later of a nine months from the date of issuance and b ten trading days after the earlier of i the public announcement of the outcome of the planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring committee of data from our phase pivotal clinical trial regarding zybrestat as a treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or ii the public announcement of the suspension  termination or abandonment of such trial for any reason 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of the units  after deducting the fees of the placement agents and other offering expenses  were approximately  the following table summarizes the number of shares of our common stock issued and the proceeds received from such sales during the year ended december  shares issued in connection with shares issued net proceeds in thousands director fees atm private placement exercise of private placement series a warrants exercise of private placement series b warrants exercise of private placement series d warrants other totals shares have been issued to our directors under the director compensation policy as compensation for their board and committee services 
in november  we received a total of  for qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section d of the internal revenue code 
we expect cash on hand  plus the proceeds of potential sales of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement with mlv to fund our operations through the second quarter of no assurance can be given that we will sell any additional shares under the sales agreement  or  if we do  as to the price or amount of shares that we will sell  or the dates on which any such sales will take place 
in order to remain a going concern beyond the second quarter of  we will require significant funding 
additional funds to finance our operations may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable  or at all 
our ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if our common shares lose their status on the nasdaq capital market  and trade in the over the counter market 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of independent registered accounting firm at the beginning of the consolidated financial statements section of this form k includes a going concern explanatory paragraph 
our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development  including zybrestat and oxi  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and

if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands less than after total year years years years clinical development and related commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract

in august  we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
this agreement was subsequently amended in june from the inception of the agreement through december   we have paid a total of  in connection with this license 
the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones  as defined in the agreement

although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase
