executive summary we are the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations 
our products and services enable nonprofit organizations to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve communications with constituents  manage finances and optimize internal operations 
we have focused solely on the nonprofit market since our incorporation in and have developed our suite of products and services based upon our extensive knowledge of the operating challenges facing nonprofit organizations 
at the end of  we had approximately  active customers 
our customers operate in multiple verticals within the nonprofit market  including education  foundations  health and human services  religion  arts and cultural  public and societal benefits  environment and animal welfare and international foreign affairs 
we derive revenue from selling perpetual licenses or charging for the use of our software products in a hosted environment and providing a broad offering of services  including consulting  training  installation and implementation  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products and are sold separately 
furthermore  we derive revenue from providing hosting services  performing donor prospect research engagements  selling lists of potential donors  and providing benchmarking studies and data modeling services 
overall  revenue in increased compared to when removing the impact of foreign currency translation  revenue increased by when comparing to this increase was principally the result of continued growth in our recurring revenue  which is comprised of maintenance and subscription offerings and represents of our revenue on a combined basis 
the growth in maintenance revenue is principally driven by maintaining high renewal rates  new maintenance contracts associated with new license arrangements and existing client increases 
the growth in subscription revenue is principally attributable to increased demand for our hosting services  online fundraising and data management offerings and the shift in our business towards hosted solutions 
revenue associated with our core perpetual license offerings and related services has decreased in when compared to as a result of the continuing decreases in sales of our perpetual license offerings to the mid market customer base  which is principally the result of customers opting to purchase our solutions under alternative packing with more flexible subscription based pricing 
we believe this trend will continue in the future 
income from operations for increased by million compared to the increase in income from operations is primarily attributable to the increase in maintenance and subscription gross profit which is driven by the continued strong retention rate of our solutions that are offered under recurring revenue arrangements and the scalability of our infrastructure that supports these offerings 
a reduction in general and administrative expenses also contributed to the increase in income from operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreases in human resource costs resulting from consolidation and centralization efforts of our accounting function in the second half of and first quarter of we ended with cash and cash equivalents totaling million and no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations  which we used to purchase million of treasury stock  pay million in dividends and purchase million of equipment

the possible decrease could result from the finalization of state income tax reviews and the expiration of statutes of limitations

we are unable to determine the period in which these liabilities will be settled  and accordingly  we have not included these amounts in the table above 
we utilize third party relationships in conjunction with our products 
the contractual arrangements vary in length from one to three years

the contracts entered into by the us entity are almost always denominated in us dollars  contracts entered into by our canadian subsidiary are generally denominated in canadian dollars  and contracts entered into by our uk  australian and netherlands subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  australian dollars and euros  respectively 
historically  as the us dollar weakened  foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non us currencies 
we do not believe our exposure to currency exchange rates has had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position and therefore we do not hedge any foreign currency risk  however  we intend to continue to monitor our foreign currency exchange rate exposure and take action as appropriate

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact revenue recognition  our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  stock based compensation and provision for income taxes  valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources selling perpetual licenses of our software products  charging for the use of our software products in a hosted environment  providing software maintenance and support services  and providing professional services including implementation  training  consulting  hosting and other services 
license fees we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software license rights when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we deem acceptance of an agreement to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted  and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers 
our typical license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  however  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
payment terms greater than days are considered to be beyond our customary payment terms 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer revenue recognition until collection 
we sell software licenses with maintenance  varying levels of professional services and  in certain instances  with hosting services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
fair value for maintenance services associated with software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in the agreements with customers  which vary according to the level of support service

index to financial statements blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provided under the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
when a software license is sold with software customization services  generally the services are to provide customer support for assistance in creating special reports and other enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
however  when software customization services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue for both the software license and the services on a percent complete basis 
subscriptions we provide hosting services to customers who have purchased perpetual rights to certain of our software products hosting services 
revenue from hosting services  as well as data enrichment services  data management services and online training programs is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract 
any related set up fees are also recognized ratably over the service period of the contract 
we are increasingly making certain of our software products available for use in hosted application arrangements without licensing perpetual rights to the software hosted applications 
revenue from hosted applications is recognized over the subscription agreement  which generally ranges from one to three years 
for contractual arrangements covering the use of hosted applications the stand alone value of the delivered items or the fair value of undelivered items in the arrangement have not been established 
such items include upfront activation  implementation and hosting of the solution 
for these arrangements we treat the transaction as a single element and the revenue is deferred until the hosted application is deployed and in use  at which time revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement 
direct and incremental costs relating to activation and implementation are capitalized until the hosted application is deployed and in use  and then expensed over the remaining term of the arrangement 
revenue from transaction processing fees is recognized when received 
credit card fees directly associated with processing donations for customers are included in subscription revenue  net of related transaction costs 
services we generally bill consulting  installation and implementation services based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
revenue is recognized for these services over the period the services are performed 
we recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements  the sale of lists of potential donors  benchmarking studies and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only upon the customer attending and completing training 
additionally  we sell fixed rate programs  which permit customers to attend unlimited training  or access training online  over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions  and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
maintenance we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year 
maintenance contracts are at rates that vary according to the level of the maintenance program and are generally renewable annually 
maintenance contracts also include the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
certain support services are sold in prepaid units of time and recognized as revenue upon their usage

index to financial statements blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued deferred revenue to the extent that our customers are billed or pay for the above described services in advance of delivery  such amounts are recorded in deferred revenue 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and maintain a reserve for returns 
we estimate the amount of this reserve based on historical experience 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of our risks and required investment returns at the time the impairment assessment is made 
goodwill is assigned to our five reporting units  which are defined as our three operating segments see note to our consolidated financial statement  target analytics and blackbaud payment processing services 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
if an impairment is indicated  the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value  which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we estimate fair value for each reporting unit based on projected future cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we believe the assumptions we use in estimating fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  but are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the annual impairment test of our goodwill indicated the estimated fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying value  no impairment was indicated

index to financial statements blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we determine the fair value of the stock options and stock appreciation rights using an option pricing model  which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the life of the award  volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award 
changes to these estimates would result in different fair values of awards 
we estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
compensation expense in a period could be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures 
provision for income tax and valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset or liability that is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the final outcome of these matters for tax reporting purposes might be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  benefits and accruals 
any difference could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
prior to october   we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code and  therefore  were not subject to federal income taxes 
in addition  we were not subject to income tax in many of the states in which we operated as a result of our s corporation status 
we historically made distributions to our stockholders to cover the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with our recapitalization  we converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
accordingly  since october  we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion and in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense within the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
our valuation allowance of million at december  is primarily associated with deferred tax assets for certain state income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards that we have determined are not more likely than not to be realized 
the ability to utilize our net deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
based on current estimates of revenue and expenses  we expect future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining deferred tax assets 
even if actual results are significantly below our current estimates  the recovery still remains likely and  except for the state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards discussed above  no valuation allowance would be necessary

index to financial statements blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
to the extent that final results differ from estimated amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have an impact on the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a us federal income tax rate of and appropriate statutory rates of various foreign  state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
if our tax rates change  we will adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting those income tax rates 
if such change is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
we recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
such tax impact recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
we record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and  therefore  the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb released accounting standards update asu  which amends the existing criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
arrangement that include perpetual software licenses are excluded from the scope of this asu 
asu establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and requires the use of best estimate of the selling price when vsoe or third party evidence tpe of the selling price cannot be determined 
as a result of the requirement to use the best estimate of the selling price when vsoe or tpe of the selling price cannot be determined  the residual method will no longer be permitted 
asu is applicable prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are required to adopt asu on january  we believe the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
