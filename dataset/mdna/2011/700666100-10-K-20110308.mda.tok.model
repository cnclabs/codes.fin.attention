our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our senior subordinated notes 
in  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of banks which  as subsequently amended  matures at april  and  as amended  currently provides for availability of up to million subject to an asset based formula 
we have the option to increase the availability under the revolving loan portion of the credit facility by million 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all our assets in the united states and canada 
borrowings from this revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 
on march  and subsequently on august   the revolving credit facility was amended to  among other things  extend its maturity date to april   reduce the loan commitment from million to million which includes a term loan a for million million outstanding at december  that is secured by real estate and machinery and equipment and an unsecured term loan b for million million outstanding at december  
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed at either i libor plus to or ii the bank s prime lending rate minus 
to plus  at the company s election 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on the company s debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to the company based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
interest on the term loan a is at either i libor plus to or ii the bank s prime lending rate plus 
to  at the company s election 
interest on the term loan b is at either i libor plus to or ii the bank s prime lending rate plus to  at the company s election 
the term loan a is amortized based on a ten year schedule with the balance due at maturity 
the term loan b is amortized over a two year period plus of debt service coverage excess capped at million 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and approximately million of unused borrowing availability 
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet current cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving loan 
table of contents portion of the credit facility is based on the company s ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the debt service ratio could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings

the company may from time to time seek to refinance  retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
it may also repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
any such actions will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain its business 
accordingly  the company may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates  which could increase its interest expense  decrease its profitability and significantly reduce its financial flexibility 
at december   the company s debt service coverage ratio was  and  therefore  it was in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant contained in the revolving credit facility 
the company was also in compliance with the other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility as of december  the debt service coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and is based on the most recently ended four fiscal quarters of consolidated ebitda minus cash taxes paid  minus unfunded capital expenditures  plus cash tax refunds to consolidated debt charges which are consolidated cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus scheduled reductions in our term debt as defined in the revolving credit facility 
the debt service coverage ratio must be greater than and not less than for any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
while we expect to remain in compliance throughout declines in sales volumes in could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
additionally  to the extent our customers are adversely affected by declines in the economy is general  they may not be able to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all  which would make the accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow under such facility 
we expect to remain in compliance throughout the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  working capital decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  accounts receivable increased million to million in from million in inventory increased by million in to million from million in while accrued expenses increased by million to million in from in and accounts payable increased million to million in from million in during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase in cash provision of million was primarily the result of net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in a change of million and net working capital decreases of million in compared to million in offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization of million in compared to during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures and made acquisitions for million in cash 
these activities  plus cash interest and tax payments of million  a reduction in borrowings of million  purchase of treasury stock of million and debt issue costs of million resulted in an increase of cash of million in 
table of contents during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase in cash provision of million was primarily the result of a decrease in net operating assets in compared to an increase in million compared to million  respectively and a decrease in net loss of million 
the decrease in net loss was partially offset by approximately million of noncash restructuring and impairment charges in during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  reduced its bank and other debt by million  and purchased 
million of its common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at december   none were outstanding 
we currently have no other derivative instruments 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and other commercial commitments over various future periods as of december  payments due or commitment expiration per period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations postretirement obligations standby letters of credit and bank guarantees total interest obligations are included on the notes only and assume the notes are paid at maturity 
the calculation of interest on debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate debt million based on average interest rate and outstanding borrowings of million at december  is not included above due to the subjectivity and estimation required 
postretirement obligations include projected postretirement benefit payments to participants only through the table above excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits disclosed in note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  since the company cannot predict with reasonable reliability  the timing of potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
we expect that funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  
table of contents application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  other than from long term contracts  when title is transferred to the customer  typically upon shipment 
revenue from long term contracts approximately of consolidated revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method  and recognized on the basis of the percentage each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost 
revenue earned on contracts in process in excess of billings is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment  management performs impairment tests of long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life of the asset has changed 
we reviewed our long lived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to idle certain facilities and consolidate certain operations  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset and the expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when we identified impairment indicators  we determined whether the carrying amount of our long lived assets was recoverable by comparing the carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we considered whether impairments existed at the lowest level of independent identifiable cash flows within a reporting unit for example  plant location  program level or asset level 
if the carrying value of the assets exceeded the expected cash flows  the company estimated the fair value of these assets by using appraisals or recent selling experience in selling similar assets or for certain assets with reasonably predicable cash flows by performing discounted cash flow analysis using the same discount rate used as the weighted average cost of capital in the respective goodwill impairment analysis to estimate fair value when market information wasn t available to determine whether an impairment existed 
certain assets were abandoned and written down to scrap or appraised value 
during  the company recorded asset impairment charges of approximately million  of which approximately million was determined based on appraisals or scrap value and approximately million was based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used in performing the discounted cash flow analysis would have been less than million with respect to the asset impairment charges 
in  the company recorded million of asset impairment charges of which million was based on appraisals and million was based on other valuation methods 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 

table of contents restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
goodwill as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  management performs impairment testing of goodwill at least annually as of october of each year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in accordance with asc  management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a reportable operating segment pursuant to asc segment reporting  or one level below the reportable operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics 
prior to our impairment analysis  we had four reporting units with recorded goodwill including supply technologies included in the supply technologies segment with million of goodwill  engineered specialty products included in the supply technology segment with million of goodwill  aluminum products with million of goodwill and capital equipment included in the manufactured products segment with million of goodwill 
at the time of goodwill impairment testing  management determined fair value of the reporting units through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit 
if the calculated fair value is less than the carrying value  impairment of the reporting unit may exist 
the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available domestic and international transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology 
the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unity in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit  which ranged from to  is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
operational management  considering industry and company specific historical and projected data  develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long term growth rates 
the projections developed for the impairment test reflected managements view considering the significant market downturn during the fourth quarter of as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow model  the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the market capitalization of the company  which had a significant decline in the fourth quarter of we completed the annual impairment tests as of october  and updated these tests  as necessary  as of december  we concluded that all of the goodwill in three of the reporting units for a total of million was impaired and written off in the fourth quarter of at december  the company had remaining goodwill of million in the capital equipment reporting unit 
we completed the annual impairment tests as of october  and and concluded that no goodwill impairment existed 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of rome and recorded goodwill of million in the aluminum products reporting unit 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of pillar and recorded additional goodwill of 
million in the capital equipment reporting unit 
income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
specifically  we measure gross deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards  such as operating losses and 
table of contents tax credits  using the applicable enacted tax rates and apply the more likely than not measurement criterion 
asc provides that future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback  carryforward period available under the tax law 
the company analyzed the four possible sources of taxable income as set forth in asc and concluded that the only relevant sources of taxable income is the reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences 
the company reviewed the projected timing of the reversal of its taxable temporary differences and determined that such reversals will offset the company s deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 
accordingly  a valuation reserve was established against the company s domestic deferred tax assets net of its deferred tax liabilities taxable temporary differences 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate 
stock based compensation asc  compensation stock compensation  requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost and was effective as of january  the company recorded expense related to stock based compensation in  and of million  million and million before tax  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc update asu no

environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws  which provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the manufactured products segment  which typically ship a few large systems per year
