item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses from continuing operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively  of which  and  respectively  were sponsored by us 
there were no research and development expenses from discontinued operations in  and competition some of the drugs we are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing intracellular receptor related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 
many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
for a discussion of the risks associated with competition  see below under item a 
risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the 
table of contents food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect to us 
for marketing outside the united states before fda approval to market  we must submit an export permit application to the fda 
we also are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and there can be no assurance that we or any of our partners will meet and sustain any such requirements 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
royalties we currently receive from king on avinza represent a portion of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza is not expected to expire until november  however  applications for generic forms of avinza have been submitted to the fda 
the last to expire united states patents relating to promacta is not expected to expire until december the last to expire united states patents related to captisol is not expected to expire until subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments 
for a discussion of the risks associated with patent and proprietary rights  see below under item a 
risk factors 
human resources as of february   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
risks related to us and our business 
our business has recently undergone a significant change  and we may not be successful in integrating the captisol technology and cydex s other development product candidates into our existing operations or in realizing the planned results from our recently expanded product portfolio and pipeline 
in january  we completed our merger with cydex  in which we obtained the captisol technology  in addition to other product candidates 
we will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize the benefits from this acquisition 
these challenges will include the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of tasks  including the following integrating cydex into our existing operations  integrating cydex s developmental product candidates and successfully managing the development and regulatory processes  and coordinating with cydex s and our collaborative partners concerning the development  manufacturing  regulatory and intellectual property protection strategies for captisol and new development product candidates 
in addition  we rely on our collaborative partners for many aspects of our developmental and commercialization activities  and we are subject to risks related to their financial stability and solvency 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition of cydex 
furthermore  all of cydex s products and product candidates  as well as the technology that it outlicenses  are based on captisol 
in addition  cydex or its partners are attempting to develop some product candidates that may contain significantly higher levels of captisol than in any currently approved product and at levels at the fda has challenged developers to demonstrate acceptable renal safety 
if products or product candidates incorporating captisol technology were to cause any unexpected adverse events  whether in preclinical studies  clinical trials or as commercialized products  whether as a result of captisol or otherwise  the perception of captisol safety could be seriously harmed 
if this were to occur  we may not be able to market these products unless and until we are able to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  which we may not be able to do 
further  whether or not the adverse event was a result of captisol  we could be required by the fda to submit to additional regulatory reviews or approvals  including extensive safety testing or clinical testing of products using captisol  which would be expensive and  even if we were to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  would delay our marketing of captisol enabled products and receipt of revenue related to those products 
royalties based on sales of avinza and promacta represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
king is obligated to pay us royalties based on its sales of avinza and gsk is obligated to pay us royalties on its sales of promacta 
these royalties are expected to be a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues for some time 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to avinza or promacta could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
setbacks for avinza and promacta could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government regulation  licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 

table of contents avinza or promacta could also face regulatory action and product safety issues 
for example  the fda previously requested expanded warnings on the avinza label to alert doctors and patients to the dangers of using avinza with alcohol 
changes were subsequently made to the label 
the fda also requested clinical studies to investigate the risks associated with taking avinza with alcohol 
any additional warnings  studies and any further regulatory action could have significant adverse effects on avinza sales 
on september   king reported that actavis  a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products headquartered in iceland  had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with a paragraph iv certification pertaining to avinza  the rights to which were acquired by king from us in february according to the report  actavis s paragraph iv certification sets forth allegations that us patent no 
 or the patent  which pertains to avinza  and which is listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  will not be infringed by actavis s manufacture  use  or sale of the product for which the anda was submitted 
the expiration date for this patent is november king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc  or elan  and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey on october  against actavis  inc and actavis elizabeth llc for patent infringement under the patent 
the lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent actavis from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 
the court held a claim construction hearing on march  and issued a ruling 
the court has scheduled trial to begin on march  on july   king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey against sandoz inc  or sandoz  for patent infringement under the patent 
according to the complaint  sandoz filed an anda for morphine sulfate extended release capsules and  in connection with the anda filing  sandoz provided written certification to the fda alleging that the claims of the patent are invalid  unenforceable and or will not be infringed by the manufacture  use or sale of sandoz s proposed morphine product 
similar to the lawsuit against actavis  this lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent sandoz from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 
the parties are in the midst of fact discovery 
a claim construction hearing was held on september  and the court issued a ruling on october  trial is currently expected to be set to start during the second half of an adverse judgement on the patent could significantly impact our future revenues 
our product candidates face significant development and regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales and or milestone revenue 
before we or our partners obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action  including bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene 
failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rates at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but are not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and 
table of contents longer development times 
for example  the trial entitled eltrombopag to reduce the need for platelet transfusion in subjects with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia undergoing elective invasive procedures elevate was suspended in october in accordance with an idmc recommendation 
gsk terminated the elevate study and the program is under review 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 
we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
we obtain captisol from a sole source supplier  and if this supplier were to cease to be able to supply captisol to us  or decline to supply captisol to us  we would be unable to continue to derive revenue or continue to develop our product candidates until we obtained an alternative source  which could take a considerable length of time 
we currently have one supplier of captisol  hovione farmaciencia sa  or hovione  through its agent hovione llc 
hovione is a major supplier of apis and api intermediates located in lisbon  portugal 
hovione has other production sites in cork  ireland and macau  china  but those sites are not yet qualified to make captisol 
if a major disaster were to happen at hovione or hovione were to suffer major production problems or were to fail to deliver captisol to us for any other reason  there could be a significant interruption of our captisol supply 
while we carry a significant inventory of captisol for this type of occurrence  which should permit us to satisfy our existing supply obligations through under current and anticipated demand conditions  an unusually large order or two could rapidly deplete that inventory and cause significant problems with our licensees and disrupt our business 
in addition  if we fail to supply captisol under our supply agreements  our customers could obtain the right to have captisol manufactured by other suppliers  which would significantly harm our business 

table of contents we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of captisol and product candidates  and if these contract manufacturers fail to perform as we expect  we will incur delays in our ability to generate revenue and substantial additional expenses in obtaining new contract manufacturers 
we do not manufacture products or product candidates  but rather contract with contract manufacturers for the manufacture of products and product candidates 
with respect to any specific product or product candidate  we only contract with one contract manufacturer due to the high cost of compliance with good manufacturing practices prior to the contract manufacturer being permitted to manufacture the product or product candidate for use in humans 
if a contract manufacturer is unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture for us in the future  we would be required to contract with a new contract manufacturer for the specific product or product candidate 
in the case of products  this would cause us to lose revenue during the qualification process  and in the case of product candidates  this could cause a delay in the commercialization of the product candidate 
in addition  in either case we would incur substantial additional expenses as a result of the new contract manufacturer becoming qualified 
further  if a contract manufacturer were to experience a delay in producing products or product candidates due to a failure to meet strict fda manufacturing requirements or otherwise  we would also experience a delay in development and commercialization of the product candidate or  in the case of products  sales of the product 
this risk is exacerbated in the case of manufacture of injectables  which require heightened sterility and other conditions as well as specialized facilities for preparation 
if we consume cash more quickly than expected  and if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be forced to curtail operations 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
also  we may acquire companies  businesses or products and the consummation of such acquisitions may consume additional cash 
for example  as part of the consideration for our recent acquisition of cydex  we distributed approximately million of our cash to cydex stockholders 
security holders of cydex  neurogen and metabasis also received contingent value rights under which we could be required to make unspecified payments under certain circumstances 
in april  we earned a million milestone payment from roche as a result of roche progressing rg into a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of hcv infection 
the milestone payment arises from a collaboration and license agreement between roche and metabasis and approximately was distributed to cvr holders under a contingent value rights agreement and the former landlord of metabasis 
on june   we committed to a plan to close our operations at our cranbury  new jersey facility  with an expected completion in the fourth quarter of in september  we ceased use of this facility 
as a result  during the quarter ended september   we recorded lease exit costs of million for costs related to the difference between the remaining lease obligations of the abandoned operating leases  which run through august  and management s estimate of potential future sublease income  discounted to present value 
we believe that our capital resources  including our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty revenues  will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least for the next twelve months 
however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time 
examples of relevant potential changes that could impact our capital resources include the costs associated with our drug research and development activities  and additional costs we may incur if our development programs are delayed or are more expensive to implement than we currently anticipate  changes in collaborative relationships  including the funding we receive in connection with those relationships  the progress of our milestone and royalty producing activities  
table of contents our ability to reach a favorable resolution with the irs with respect to their audit of our fiscal federal tax return  or to other potential tax assessments  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  the termination of our lease agreements  the costs of the closure of our operations at our cranbury  new jersey facility  the purchase of additional capital equipment  cash payments  including cvr payments  or refunds we may be required to make pursuant to certain agreements with third parties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the outcome of related litigation 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly  including but not limited to reducing our current headcount  or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with partners or other third parties that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
if  as the result of a merger  or otherwise  our collaborative partners were to change their strategy or the focus of their development and commercialization efforts with respect to our alliance products  the success of our alliance products could be adversely affected 
our collaborative partners may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts as the result of a merger 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have historically re evaluated their priorities from time to time  including following mergers and consolidations which are common in these industries  and two of our collaborative partners have recently entered into merger agreements 
in october  wyeth  a collaborative partner of ours  and pfizer announced that pfizer had completed its acquisition of wyeth in a cash and stock transaction 
furthermore  in november  schering plough corporation  another of our collaborative partners  and merck co  inc  or merck  announced that merck and schering plough had combined  under the name merck  in a stock and cash transaction 
as a result of the consummation of these mergers  our collaborative partners may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with our alliance products 
furthermore  the ability of our alliance products to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborative partners reduce or fail to increase spending related to such products as a result of these mergers 
on may   we received written notice from trevena  inc that  effective immediately  it was exercising its right to terminate the research and license agreement  dated february   as amended  between trevena and us 
under this agreement  we agreed to screen biological target receptors selected by trevena against our library of compounds to identify potential active compounds for the development of novel therapeutics 
we believe that this agreement was terminated in response to changes in trevena internal research priorities relating to the subject matter of the research collaboration 
on may   pfizer inc announced in a form q filed with the sec that it is in the process of withdrawing its ndas with the fda relating to fablyn lasofoxifene tartrate 
as previously disclosed  fablyn is a selective estrogen receptor modulator product candidate that resulted from a collaboration between pfizer and us formed to develop therapies for osteoporosis 
pfizer submitted an nda to the fda and a marketing authorization application to the european medicines agency for fablyn for the treatment of osteoporosis in 
table of contents december and january  respectively  and in february  pfizer received approval from the european commission for fablyn tablets 
under the terms of our agreement with pfizer  we are entitled to receive royalty payments on worldwide net sales of lasofoxifene for any indication 
pfizer has indicated that it is exploring strategic options for fablyn  including out licensing or sale 
on september   we received notice from gsk that it was exercising its right to terminate the product development and commercialization agreement  dated as of march  and as amended  among smithklinebeecham corporation  doing business as glaxosmithkline  glaxo group limited and pharmacopeia  llc  as successor to pharmacopeia drug discovery  inc the termination became effective on october  absent the termination by gsk  the research term under this agreement would have terminated on march  following termination  we retained rights to the current programs under this agreement and may continue to develop the programs and commercialize any products resulting from the programs  or we may elect to cease progressing the programs and or seek other partners for further development and commercialization 
in october   pfizer announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire king 
pfizer has commenced a tender offer and pfizer and king are targeting a first quarter closing assuming execution of the tender process and receipt of the appropriate regulatory clearances 
there can be no assurance of the impact that this anticipated acquisition will have on our relationship with pfizer or king  or that the acquisition will occur at all 
if our collaborative partners terminate their collaborations with us or do not commit sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or distribution of our alliance products  we could be required to devote additional resources to our alliance products  seek new collaborative partners or abandon such alliance products  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are currently dependent upon outlicensing business and we may not be successful in entering into additional out license agreements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our liquidity or require us to alter development plans on our products 
we have entered into several out licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of our products 
we currently depend on our arrangements with our outlicensees to sell products using our captisol technology 
if our outlicensees discontinue sales of products using our captisol technology  fail to obtain regulatory approval for their products using our captisol technology  fail to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us  or if we are unable to establish new licensing and marketing relationships  our financial results and growth prospects would be materially affected 
further  under most of our captisol outlicenses  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or will cease when the relevant patent expires 
while we have other more recent patents relating to captisol with later expiration dates for example  our high purity patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until and our morphology patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until  the initially filed patents relating to captisol expire in in the us and are expected to expire between and outside the us  and if our other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent a generic form of captisol from coming to market  the source of the vast majority of our revenue may cease to exist 
although we expend considerable resources on internal research and development for our proprietary programs  we may not be successful in entering into additional out licensing agreements under favorable terms due to several factors including the difficulty in creating valuable product candidates that target large market opportunities  research and spending priorities of potential licensing partners  willingness of and the resources available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to in license product candidates for their clinical pipelines  or differences of opinion with potential partners on the valuation of products we are seeking to out license 

table of contents the inability to enter into out licensing agreements under favorable terms and to earn milestone payments  license fees and or upfront fees may adversely affect our liquidity and may force us to curtail or delay development of some or all of our proprietary programs  which in turn may harm our business and the value of our stock 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact avinza  promacta  viviant and conbriza bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  lgd  and any other products or potential products 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  other possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
expirations of  challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
the initially filed patents relating to captisol expire in in the us and are expcted to expire between and outside the us we have also obtained patent protection in the us through on agglomerated form and through on high purity form of captisol 
we have obtained patent protection on a number of combinations of apis and captisol through three combination patents in the us  and we have 
table of contents applied for six additional combination patents in the us relating to the combination of captisol with specific apis 
our us combination patent relating to fosphenytoin expires june  and our us combination patent relating to amiodarone expires may  our us combination patent relating to one of our early stage product candidates expires march  there is no guarantee that these patents will be sufficient to prevent competitors from using captisol after and competing against us  or from developing combination patents for products that will prevent us from developing products using those apis 
in addition  most of the agreements in our captisol outlicensing business  including our agreements with pfizer relating to geodon im  vfend iv and cerenia  provide that once the relevant patent expires  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or eliminated 
generally  our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the united states patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential 
table of contents products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of our key management and scientific personnel 
if we fail to retain such key employees  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
if plaintiffs bring product liability lawsuits against us or our partners  we or our partners may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our approved products and product candidates  and we may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
we and our partners face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and face an even greater risk for commercialized products 
although we are not currently a party to product liability litigation  if we are sued  we may be held liable if any product or product candidate we develop causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop  injury to our reputation  discontinuation of clinical trials  costs to defend litigation  substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients  loss of revenue and the inability to commercialize any products that we develop 
we have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a million annual limit 
we intend to expand product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any products that we may develop 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our product candidates or any future products  our liability could exceed our total assets 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify eisai and king under certain circumstances pursuant to the asset purchase agreements we entered into with eisai and king in connection with the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
some of our indemnification obligations still remain and our potential liability in certain circumstances is not limited to specific dollar amounts 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 
the sale of our prior commercial product lines does not relieve us of exposure to product liability risks on products we sold prior to divesting these product lines 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us may not be insured and could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 

table of contents if our partners do not reach the market with our alliance products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if our partners are not effective in marketing our alliance products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
our competitors might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than our partners can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us or our partners  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 
we use hazardous materials  which may expose us to significant liability 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
we engage one or more third parties to manage some of our cash consistent with an investment policy that allows a range of investments and maturities 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss are to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
as a result of changes in the credit market  one of our short term investments in commercial paper was in default 
as a result  we were unable to recoup all of our investment in the commercial paper 
in addition  from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
we may require additional money to run our business and may be required to raise this money on terms which are not favorable to us or which reduce our stock price 
we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 

table of contents our drug development programs will require substantial additional future funding which could hurt our operational and financial condition 
our drug development programs require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 
our future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and human studies  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in our existing collaborations  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we expect our research and development expenditures over the next three years to continue to be significant 
however  we base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables 
such uncertainties include regulatory approvals  the timing of events outside our direct control such as product launches by partners and the success of such product launches  negotiations with potential strategic partners  possible sale of assets or other transactions and other factors 
any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities from cash generated from avinza  promacta  viviant and conbriza royalties and royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so  we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
significant returns of products we sold prior to selling our prior commercial businesses could harm our operating results 
under our agreements to sell our prior commercial businesses  we remain financially responsible for returns of our products sold before those businesses were transferred to their respective buyers 
consequently  if returns of those products are higher than expected  we could incur substantial expenses for processing and issuing refunds for those returns which  in turn  could negatively impact our financial results 
the amount of returns could be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  ongoing product demand  product rotation at distributors and wholesalers  and product stability issues 
our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn 
our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 

table of contents our investment securities consist primarily of money market funds  corporate debt obligations and us government agency securities 
we do not have any auction rate securities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effects on various securities markets 
we cannot provide assurance that our investments are not subject to adverse changes in market value 
if our investments experience adverse changes in market value  we may have less capital to fund our operations 
we may be unable to successfully integrate metabasis and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
in january  we completed our merger with metabasis 
the integration of an independent company is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
it is possible that the integration processes could result in the loss of key employees  diversion of management s attention  the disruption or interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with licensors  collaborators  partners  suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger  or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and  as a result  adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
during the integration process for our metabasis acquisition  we have become aware that the electronic data we received as part of the acquisition is incomplete due to the data retention and backup policies in place at metabasis prior to the time of the acquisition 
the missing electronic data could impact our ability to partner affected compounds and may lead to increased costs and development time for affected programs  which could impact our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and lead to unanticipated development costs 
we expect to incur significant costs and commit significant management time integrating metabasis business operations  technology  development programs  products and personnel with those of ours 
if we do not successfully integrate the business of metabasis  the expenditure of these costs will reduce our cash position 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
on november   we effected a for reverse stock split 
we believe the reverse stock split will have the effect of increasing the per share trading price of our common stock 
many factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including  but not limited to  the following factors results of or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the success of our collaboration agreements  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra  formerly the national association of securities dealers  inc and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of finra 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 

table of contents any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
while no material weaknesses were identified as of december   we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods 
the existence of one or more material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
impairment charges pertaining to goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets from our mergers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
the total purchase price pertaining to our mergers with pharmacopeia  neurogen  metabasis and cydex have been allocated to net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development and goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price  operating results and results of operations 
we may acquire companies  businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time consuming 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  or issue additional shares  to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
as part of our efforts to acquire companies  business or product candidates or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks and other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we acquire product candidates  we will also need to make certain assumptions about  among other things  development costs  the likelihood of receiving regulatory approval and the market for such product candidates 
our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 
in addition  we will likely experience significant charges to earnings in connection with our efforts  if any  to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that are ultimately not consummated  these charges may include 
table of contents fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur  as part of a transaction  substantial charges for closure costs associated with elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired ipr d charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
our cydex facilities are located in a tornado zone  and the occurrence of a tornado or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities and equipment  which could cause us to curtail or cease local operations 
our cydex facilities are located outside of kansas city  kansas  which is in a tornado zone 
we are therefore vulnerable to damage from tornados 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  such as power loss  fire  floods and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired 
we are insured against up to million in damages resulting from natural disasters  including tornados 
we currently may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions  and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage 
any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business  financial condition and prospects

overview we are a biotechnology company that operates with a simple business model focused on developing or acquiring revenue generating assets and coupling them to a lean corporate cost structure 
our goal is to create a sustainably profitable business and generate meaningful value for our stockholders 
since our business model is based on the goal of partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize and market our assets  the revenue that supports our business is based largely on payments made to us by partners for royalties  milestones  license fees  and material sales of captisol 
we expect to receive revenue from eight partner marketed products in and have a portfolio of over fifty additional programs that are in various stages of development with the potential to become future revenue generating assets 
this portfolio of assets is highly diversified across numerous technology types  therapeutic areas  drug targets  and industry partners  offering investors a unique and  we believe  lower risk portfolio opportunity in which to invest in the increasingly complicated and unpredictable pharmaceutical industry 
these programs address the unmet medical needs of patients for a broad spectrum of diseases including hepatitis  muscle wasting  alzheimer s disease  dyslipidemia  diabetes  anemia  copd  asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  oncology and osteoporosis 
we have established multiple alliances with the world s leading pharmaceutical companies including glaxosmithkline  merck  pfizer  bristol myers squibb  onyx  and astrazeneca 
on september   we announced the sale of ontak  targretin capsules  targretin gel  and panretin gel to eisai  inc  or eisai  and the sale of avinza to king pharmaceuticals  inc  or king 
the eisai sales transaction subsequently closed on october  the avinza sale transaction subsequently closed on february  accordingly  the results for the oncology and avinza product lines have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of pharmacopeia  inc  or pharmacopeia  a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to address significant medical needs 

table of contents on december   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of neurogen corporation  or neurogen  a drug development company historically focusing on small molecule drugs to improve the lives of patients suffering from psychiatric and neurological disorders with significant unmet medical needs 
on january   we completed the acquisition of metabasis therapeutics  inc  or metabasis  following approval of the transaction by metabasis stockholders 
as a result  we gained a fully funded partnership with hoffman la roch  or roche  additional pipeline assets and drug discovery technologies and resources 
on january   we completed the acquisition of cydex pharmaceuticals  inc  or cydex  following approval of the transaction by cydex stockholders 
as a result  we gained revenue from four currently marketed products  a large portfolio of partnered drug development programs  an internal pipeline of proprietary drugs  and the captisol drug formulation platform technology 
metabasis contingent value rights in january  we completed our acquisition of metabasis 
in addition to cash consideration  we issued four tradable contingent value rights cvrs  one cvr from each of four respective series of cvrs  for each metabasis share 
the cvrs will entitle the holder to cash payments as frequently as every six months as cash is received by us from proceeds from metabasis partnership with roche or the sale or partnering of any of the metabasis drug development programs  among other triggering events 
we have also committed to spend at least million in new research and development funding on the metabasis programs within months following the closing of the transaction 
through december   we estimate that we have spent approximately million of the committed amount 
in april  we earned a million milestone payment from roche as a result of roche progressing rg into a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of hepatitis c viral hcv infection 
the milestone payment arises from a collaboration and license agreement between roche and metabasis  and approximately was distributed to cvr holders in june in november  we received a notice from roche providing that roche was exercising its right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement dated as of august  among roche and metabasis 
under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  the termination was effective upon days prior written notice 
upon termination  the licenses granted under the agreement automatically terminated and reverted to the granting party 
in addition  we will receive a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license under specified roche patents to develop  make and sell related compounds and products  subject to royalty payments on net sales 
any future assignment or sublicensing of such a license from roche may be subject to roche s prior written consent 
roche will be prohibited for ten years following the termination from developing or commercializing related compounds 
in january  we entered into a strategic relationship with chiva pharmaceuticals  inc to develop multiple assets and technology in china and potentially worldwide 
chiva was granted licenses to begin immediate development in china of two clinical stage hepdirect programs  pradefovir for hepatitis b and mb for hepatocellular carcinoma 
additionally  we granted chiva a non exclusive hepdirect technology license for the discovery  development and worldwide commercialization of new compounds in hepatitis b hepb  hepatitis c hepc and hepatocellular carcinoma hcc 
under the terms of the agreement  we are entitled to milestones and royalties on potential sales 
in addition  we received a equity position in chiva and will also receive a portion of any sublicensing revenue generated from sublicensing of collaboration compounds to third parties in a major world market 
we will receive initial license payments that total million

as a result  we recorded lease exit costs of million for costs related to the difference between the remaining lease obligations of the abandoned operating leases  which run through august  and management s estimate of potential future sublease income  discounted to present value 
actual future sublease income may differ materially from our estimate  which would result in us recording additional expense or reductions in expense 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million of property and equipment related to the facility closure 
we also recorded approximately million of severance related costs 
in august  we entered into a lease termination agreement for our corporate facility in san diego 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay a termination fee of million as follows million was paid upon signing  million was paid in july and million is due in april as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded lease termination costs of million  which includes the net present value of the lease termination payments of million and million of other costs associated with the lease termination 
write off of in process research and development in november  roche notified us that they were exercising their right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement with our subsidiary  metabasis 
as a result  we reviewed the carrying amount of the intangible asset related to this agreement 
based on our analysis of available information  we determined that the asset would not generate any future cash flow 
therefore  we wrote off the million of acquired in process research and development associated with the agreement during the year ended december  for acquisitions prior to january   the fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects  which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition  were immediately expensed 
we wrote off the estimated fair value of million of acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of pharmacopeia in the estimated fair value relates to specific internal and partnered product candidates targeting a variety of indications which are currently in various stages of development ranging from preclinical to phase ii 
due to the nature of our internal development programs and our collaborative partnerships  management does not expect to incur significant costs related to these programs 
the estimated fair value is driven by future milestones and royalties 
management anticipates potential milestones in the near term and the possibility of significant royalties beginning in however  as these potential products have not reached commercialization  we or our partners face risks inherent in the development of products in the human health care market and will continue to face significant risks as no assurance can be given that product development efforts will be successful  required regulatory approvals for any indication will be obtained  any products  if introduced  will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or  patient and physician acceptance of these products will be achieved 
these risks may cause significant delays in the timing or potential success of commercialization of 
table of contents these products  which could materially impact estimated future cash flows 
of the total fair value  million relates to product candidates currently in the preclinical stage of development as follows million related to various candidates under our collaboration with gsk  million related to the jak program with wyeth  and related to our internal ccr program  million relates to product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials as follows million related to schering plough oncology related product candidates and million related to a product candidate being developed by celgene targeting inflammation  and million relates to product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials as follows million related to schering plough s cxcr program targeting copd and asthma and million related to a p mapk inhibitor program targeting rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis being developed by bms 
we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired in process research and development  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of for product candidates in the preclinical stage  for product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials and for product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired inprocess research and development may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition 
as a result of adjustments to our purchase price allocation related to our acquisition of pharmacopeia  we wrote off an additional million of acquired in process research and development during the year ended december  accretion of deferred gain on sale leaseback in october  we entered into an agreement for the sale of our real property located in san diego  california for a purchase price of million 
this property  with a net book value of million  included one building totaling approximately  square feet  the land on which the building is situated  and two adjacent vacant lots 
as part of the sale transaction  we agreed to lease back the building for a period of years 
we recognized an immediate pre tax gain on the sale transaction of million in and deferred a gain of million on the sale of the building 
the deferred gain was being recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the lease at a rate of approximately million per year 
in august  we entered into a lease termination agreement for this building 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of accretion of deferred gain during the quarter ended september   and will recognize the remaining balance of the deferred gain of million through the term of our new building lease  which expires in december the amount of the deferred gain recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
interest income interest income was million for  compared to million for and million for the decreases from to and from to are due to lower invested balances and lower interest rates 

table of contents decrease in liability for contingent value rights we recorded a decrease in liability for cvrs of million for the year ended december  the decrease relates to our liability for amounts potentially due to holders of cvrs associated with our metabasis acquisition 
the initial fair value of the liability was determined using quoted market prices of metabasis common stock in active markets 
the liability is subsequently marked to market at each reporting period based upon the quoted market prices of the underlying cvr  and the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
the carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly based upon quoted market prices and actual amounts paid under the cvr agreements may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability 
the fair value of the liability at december  was  compared to million at the date of acquisition

table of contents in july  we purchased million of commercial paper issued by golden key ltd 
the investment was highly rated and within our investment policy at the time of purchase  but during the third quarter of  large credit rating agencies downgraded the quality of this security 
in addition  as a result of not meeting certain liquidity covenants  the assets of golden key ltd 
were assigned to a trustee who established a committee of the largest senior credit holders to determine the next steps 
subsequently  golden key ltd 
defaulted on its obligation to settle the security on the stated maturity date of october  during  the assets of golden key ltd 
were sold through an auction process and  as a result  the company received a final cash distribution of approximately million  of which million was recognized as a gain 
in connection with the acquisition of pharmacopeia on december   pharmacopeia security holders received a contingent value right that entitles them to an aggregate cash payment of million under certain circumstances 
at december  and  our management deemed  based on available information  that the likelihood of payment was not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt and  therefore  no liability has been recorded 
in connection with the acquisition of neurogen corporation on december   neurogen security holders received cvrs under four cvr agreements

critical accounting policies certain of our policies require the application of management judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates made 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition royalties on sales of avinza  viviant  conbriza and promacta are recognized in the quarter reported by the respective partner 
revenue from research funding under our collaboration agreements is earned and recognized on a percentage of completion basis as research hours are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under our collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and we have no further performance obligations relating to that event  and ii collectibility is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
co promote termination accounting as part of the termination and return of co promotion rights agreement that we entered into with organon in january  we agreed to make quarterly payments to organon  effective for the fourth quarter of  equal to of avinza net sales through december  and thereafter through patent expiration  currently anticipated to be november the estimated fair value of the amounts to be paid to organon after the termination million as of january  based on the future estimated net sales of the product  was recognized as a liability and expensed as a cost of the termination as of the effective date of the agreement  january 
table of contents in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which approximated million as of december  
as organon has not consented to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event of king s default of this obligation 
therefore  we recorded an asset on february  to recognize king s assumption of the obligation  while continuing to carry the co promote termination liability in our consolidated financial statements to recognize our legal obligation as primary obligor to organon 
this asset represents a non interest bearing receivable for future payments to be made by king and is recorded at its fair value 
as of december  and thereafter  the receivable and liability will remain equal and adjusted each quarter for changes in the fair value of the obligation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
annually management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december  and  the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future undiscounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
during  the irs issued to us a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  seeking an increase to our taxable income for the fiscal year of million and a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million related to the income tax effect of the nopa and million related to estimated interest due on the proposed underpayment of tax 
we also recorded deferred income tax assets of million associated with the ability to carry back losses from and to offset the nopa 
in addition  we recorded an income tax receivable of million associated with changes in income tax law in relation to prior amt taxes paid on carry back periods 
in november  the irs granted us an extension of time to make a closing of the books election with respect to an ownership change  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  for the tax year 
we filed an amended federal tax return in the fourth quarter of in january  we were notified by the irs that they had completed their examination resulting in no changes to the taxes for our tax year 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as recoverability was uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost for awards to employees and non employee directors is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests 
compensation cost for consultant awards is recognized over each separate tranche s vesting period 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  associated with option awards  restricted stock and an equitable adjustment of employee stock options 
the fair value for options that were awarded to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the expected term of the employee and non employee director options is the estimated weighted average period until exercise or cancellation of vested options forfeited unvested options are not considered based on historical experience 
the expected term for consultant awards is the remaining period to contractual expiration 
volatility is a measure of the expected amount of variability in the stock price over the expected life of an option expressed as a standard deviation 
in selecting this assumption  we used the historical volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation would impact the amount of compensation expenses recognized during the period 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
asu is effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  we do not believe that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
