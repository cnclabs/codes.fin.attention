starting in the first quarter  selling prices improved moderately for specialty phosphates and significantly for gtsp other  but in total were still lower on average compared to specialty phosphates sales of million in increased versus last year with volumes up and prices down against the average 
the price decline was primarily in comparison to high first half pricing levels with a reducing impact through the year contributing to improving revenue growth 
gtsp other sales at million for were more than double those achieved in  with volumes up and prices up 
in addition to strong domestic demand  continued success in developing new markets resulted in a significant increase in export volumes with full year export revenue representing of total specialty phosphates revenue  up from in in the fourth quarter  specialty phosphates year over year volume growth continued resulting in revenue growth 
ongoing volume strength is expected to continue  and  combined with price increases  is expected to result in year over year specialty phosphates net sales growth rates for similar to  or better than  those achieved in the fourth quarter specialty phosphates operating income margin for is expected to be similar to the full year average  except during the first quarter  when margins are expected to be somewhat above this level for the reasons outlined below 
gtsp volume is expected to be strong for  with pricing early in the first quarter trending higher than the fourth quarter level 
as in prior years  volumes may vary from quarter to quarter in a wide range depending on shipment timing  with the first quarter typically a seasonally weaker quarter 
on average  however  at current pricing levels  gtsp other is expected to deliver approximately million revenue per quarter in at an operating income margin of approximately  except during the first quarter  when margins are expected to be somewhat above this level for the reasons outlined below 
with continued strong demand for phosphate fertilizers  the key innophos raw materials  phosphate rock and sulfur  have risen steadily in and further increases in market prices are indicated for the first quarter at current first quarter market prices  management s expectation is for year over year raw material cost increases at the upper end of an expected to million range per quarter 
of this  million was realized in the fourth quarter  a similar increase is expected for the first quarter  and the remaining increase is expected to take effect in the second quarter with the business expecting to successfully increase selling prices in line with market changes in raw material costs  but the lagged nature of purchase contracts delaying the catch up of costs of goods sold to market levels  operating income margins are expected to be to percentage points higher in first quarter than normalized levels  in spite of the impact of a scheduled maintenance turnaround at the coatzacoalcos site during the first quarter 
trends in raw material prices are difficult to predict into the second half of  however  further increases are possible and we would expect to be able to increase selling prices further  if required  to cover higher purchase costs 
the company has successfully reached agreement with three preferred phosphate rock suppliers on major terms for supply to the coatzacoalcos facility 
in addition to these primary sources  innophos has options for other spot suppliers and will continue to qualify and develop additional new sources for potential future supply
