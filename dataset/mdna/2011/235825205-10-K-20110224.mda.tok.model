item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes in item management overview dana is headquartered in maumee  ohio and was incorporated in delaware in as a leading supplier of driveline products axles  driveshafts and transmissions  power technologies sealing and thermal management products and genuine service parts for light and heavy vehicle manufacturers world wide  our customer base includes virtually every major vehicle manufacturer in the global light vehicle  medium heavy vehicle and off highway markets 
at december   we employed approximately  people  operated in countries and had major manufacturing distribution  engineering and office facilities around the world 
we are committed to continuing to diversify our product offerings  customer base and geographic footprint and minimizing our exposure to individual market and segment declines 
in  of our revenue came from north american operations and from operations throughout the rest of the world 
light vehicle products including power technologies and structures accounted for of our global revenues  with commercial vehicle and off highway products representing 
business strategy during the past three years  we have significantly improved our financial condition reducing debt  raising additional equity  improving the profitability of customer programs  eliminating structural costs and reducing working capital investment 
we have also strengthened our leadership team and streamlined our operating segments to focus on our core light vehicle driveline and power technologies businesses and our heavy vehicle on highway commercial and off highway businesses 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to put increasing focus on profitable growth 
while we intend to continue aggressively reducing cost and streamlining our business operations  our future strategy includes several growth initiatives directed at strengthening the competitiveness of our products  geographic expansion  aftermarket opportunities and selective acquisitions 
strengthening the competitiveness of our products additional engineering and operational investment is being channeled into reinvigorating our product portfolio and capitalizing on technology advancement 
table of contents opportunities 
in  we combined our light and heavy vehicle products north american engineering centers allowing us the opportunity to better share technologies among our businesses 
we are constructing a new engineering facility in india that more than doubles our engineering presence in that country 
this facility will house state of the art design and test capabilities that globally support each of our businesses 
geographic expansion although there are growth opportunities in each region  we will be focused on the asia pacific region  especially india and china 
in addition to the new engineering facility referenced above  india is nearing completion of a new hypoid gear manufacturing facility which is scheduled to begin production in the first half of the additional investment in our china based joint venture with dongfeng significantly increases our commercial vehicle driveline presence in the region 
we have experienced considerable success in the china off highway and industrial markets and believe that there is considerable opportunity for future growth 
similar to india  we are directing additional investment in our engineering capabilities in china 
aftermarket opportunities we have established a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses targeting future aftermarket revenues of of consolidated sales 
selective acquisitions our current acquisition focus is to identify bolt on acquisition opportunities that have strategic fit with our existing businesses  particularly opportunities that would support the other growth initiatives discussed above and enhance the value proposition of our customer product offerings 
any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth 
sale of the structural products business we closed on the sale of substantially all of our structural products business except for the operations in venezuela in march and completed the divestiture in venezuela in december we received cash proceeds of during the year  excluding amounts related to the working capital adjustment and tooling and reduced outstanding debt under our term facility by approximately remains receivable at the end of under the agreement  including related to an earn out provision  held in escrow and of deferred proceeds 
the earn out payment vested in january and is to be paid by metalsa in february all but of the remaining is expected to be received before the fourth quarter of in  we recorded an additional pre tax loss of  resulting from a price adjustment negotiated prior to the march close and we recorded additional tax expense of in connection with the sale  leases covering three us facilities were assigned to a us affiliate of metalsa 
under the terms of the sale agreement  dana will guarantee the affiliate s performance under the leases which run through june including approximately of annual payments 
in the event of a required payment by dana as guarantor  dana is entitled to pursue full recovery from metalsa of the amounts paid under the guarantee and to take possession of the leased property 
acquisitions in june  our subsidiary dana mauritius purchased of the registered capital of ddac  a commercial vehicle axle manufacturer in china formerly known as dongfeng axle co  ltd  from dongfeng motor and certain of its affiliates for dana hong kong has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to purchase the original investment and an additional equity interest in ddac 
we signed a definitive agreement to increase our investment in ddac in february and will make a payment approximating at closing once the transaction receives the approval of the chinese government  which is expected in the second quarter of in connection with our increase in ownership  ddac entered into a contingent consideration arrangement with a dongfeng motor affiliate that provides for reductions in the selling price of goods sold by ddac to such affiliate for a period of up to four years if the earnings of ddac surpass specified targets 
dana s share of ddac s earnings could be reduced by an amount not to exceed we have concluded that this reduction comprises contingent consideration  the fair value of which will be determined at closing  recorded as a liability and amortized to equity in earnings of affiliates over the term of the arrangement 

table of contents in february  we completed a transaction with sifco  a leading producer of steer axles and forged components in south america 
through this transaction  we acquired the distribution rights to sifco s commercial vehicle steer axle systems and we are now responsible for all customer relationships  including marketing  sales  engineering and assembly 
the addition of truck and bus steer axles to our product offering in south america effectively positions us as the leading full line supplier of commercial vehicle drivelines including front and rear axles  driveshafts and suspension systems 
in return for payment of to sifco  we obtained an exclusive  long term supply agreement to ensure supply of key driveline components 
additionally  sifco will provide selected assets and assistance to dana to establish  in the near term  assembly capabilities for these systems 
at current production levels  this arrangement is expected to generate annual sales of approximately we expect to account for this transaction as a business combination  with the purchase price expected to be allocable predominately to fixed assets and intangible assets 
segments we manage our operations globally through five operating segments 
our operations serving the light vehicle market primarily support light vehicle oems with products for light trucks  suvs  cuvs  vans and passenger cars 
the operating segments in the light vehicle markets are lvd  power technologies and structures 
substantially all of the structures business was sold in the first quarter of the reporting of our operating segment results was reorganized in the first quarter of in line with our management structure as the sealing and thermal segments were combined into the power technologies segment and our brazilian driveshaft operations were moved from lvd to commercial vehicle 
the results of these segments have been retroactively adjusted to conform to the current reporting structure 
two operating segments  commercial vehicle and off highway  support the oems of medium duty classes and heavy duty class commercial vehicles primarily trucks and buses and off highway vehicles primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction and agricultural applications

table of contents north america light vehicle markets production levels in the north american markets were negatively impacted by overall economic conditions which began in the second half of and continued through much of resulting in overall light vehicle production in being down about from production levels increased significantly during the second half of as gm and chrysler both emerged from relatively short bankruptcy reorganizations and improving market and overall economic conditions led to increased vehicle sales 
gradually improving economic conditions continued in  which led to increased light vehicle production of just under million units in while up from the low levels of the previous year  production remained well below levels 
however  in the light truck pickup  van and suv segment where more of our programs are focused  production declined from to by about and rebounded strongly in with an increase in production of about in  production levels in this segment of the market were slightly higher than levels 
with vehicle sales strengthening since the second half of  total light vehicle inventory levels have improved considerably from days supply at december  to days supply at december  and days supply at december  inventory levels in the light truck pickup  van and suv segment experienced similar improvement  declining from days supply at december  to and days supply at december  and based on current inventory levels  near term production levels are likely to be driven more directly by vehicle sales 
despite economic factors like high unemployment levels and increased fuel costs possibly constraining growth in the north american markets  we expect to see continued strengthening of light vehicle production levels in our current outlook has light vehicle production levels increasing to over levels nearing those experienced three years ago 
as we look at our primary light truck pickup  van and suv segment where the rebound was larger  we expect production levels to be relatively comparable with those in or up modestly 
medium heavy vehicle markets developments in north america have a significant impact on our results as this region accounts for more than of our global sales in the commercial vehicle market 
the north american medium heavy truck market was impacted by many of the same overall economic conditions negatively impacting the light vehicle markets  as customers have been cautious about the economic outlook and  consequently  new vehicle purchases 
after declining around from to  production levels rebounded to some extent in with heavy duty class truck production increasing about over and medium duty classes production increasing about 
with the continued overall improvement in the economy  new truck orders have strengthened during the last half of we expect another significant increase in class production in our current outlook has class production up to over in the medium duty segment  we also expect some production strengthening  but we believe it could be a modest increase of around to a stronger increase of about 
markets outside of north america light vehicle markets during  overall economic weakness impacted light vehicle production globally  resulting in a decline in markets outside north america of about

instead  production levels for were relatively flat in asia pacific and down modestly in south america 
both these regions saw production levels strengthen in  with south america up about and asia pacific up more than 
for  we expect the light vehicle markets in south america and asia pacific to show continued strength with production levels being to higher than levels 
in europe  our outlook has production levels remaining relatively comparable with those of 
table of contents medium heavy vehicle markets outside of north america  medium and heavy duty truck production was severely impacted in by the overall global economic weakness 
european medium heavy production levels in were down about when compared to  while the markets in south america and asia pacific were around and lower 
with improving economic conditions in  production levels outside north america improved considerably 
while increasing about over  production in europe remained well below levels 
the production rebound in south america and asia pacific in was much stronger  with higher production of around in south america and in asia pacific bringing production in those regions to levels higher in in  we expect to see continued strengthening in the europe markets  with production levels up to and in the south america markets with production levels up to 
in asia pacific  we expect the relatively strong markets to continue with production levels being relatively comparable to those experienced this past year 
off highway markets our off highway business has become an increasingly significant component of our total operations 
unlike our on highway businesses  our off highway business is largely concentrated outside of north america  with about two thirds of its sales coming from europe and from south america and asia pacific combined 
we serve several segments of the diverse off highway market  including construction  agriculture  mining and material handling 
our largest markets are the european and north american construction and agricultural equipment segments 
during  the adverse effects of a weaker global economy significantly reduced demand levels in these markets 
demand in the construction market was down to from while demand in the agricultural market was down to 
during the later part of  we began to see improving levels of customer demand in these markets which led to demand levels being up about to in the agriculture segment and to in the construction segment 
in  we expect these markets to continue to recover with demand levels increasing to in the agriculture segment and to in the construction segment

the table above refers to adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure which we have defined to be earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash equity grant expense  restructuring expense and other nonrecurring items gain loss on debt extinguishment or divestitures  impairment  etc adjusted ebitda is currently being used by dana as the primary measure of its operating segment performance 
the most significant impact on dana s ongoing results of operations as a result of applying fresh start accounting following our emergence from bankruptcy was higher depreciation and amortization 
by using adjusted ebitda  which excludes depreciation and amortization  the comparability of results is enhanced 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is an important measure since the financial covenants in our debt agreements are based  in part  on adjusted ebitda 
segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for income loss before income taxes  net income loss or other results reported in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
see segment results of operations versus below for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income loss before income taxes 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  which we have defined as cash provided by operations excluding any bankruptcy claim related payments  less capital spending 
we believe this measure is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations 
free cash flow is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by used in operating activities reported under gaap 
free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

we also tightened our capital spending and reduced working capital levels 
as sales began improving in  we resisted bringing back much of the cost structure that was eliminated in and the combination of stronger sales levels  cost reductions and improved pricing led to improved profitability and cash flow in while we are continuing to make additional cost improvements and restructure the operations in  we will also be pursuing the growth initiatives described in the business strategy section 
we are currently expecting that additional strengthening in sales levels in and further benefits from cost reductions and restructuring actions will more than offset the cost associated with our growth initiatives thereby providing improved adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percent of sales in primarily as a result of projecting capital spending of to in as compared to in  we expect free cash flow to be somewhat lower than in  but still exceeding consolidated results of operations summary consolidated results of operations versus

increased sales in north america during  adjusted for the effects of currency and divestitures  was a increase on sales adjusted for divestitures 
the increase was largely due to the increased oem production levels in the light vehicle and medium heavy truck markets 
light duty production levels were more than higher in with production in the light pickup  van and suv segment the sector most important to us being up around 
in the medium heavy truck markets production was up about 
in the off highway sector  improvement in demand levels contributed to increased sales of around 
excluding currency effects  our european sales were higher in than in our businesses in europe benefited from stronger production levels in each of our markets  while also benefiting from demand levels for certain light vehicle programs that were stronger than the overall market 
stronger international currencies increased sales by in south america and in asia pacific 
the organic growth in sales in south america and asia pacific represent increases of and over sales adjusted for divestitures  due principally to the higher production levels in these regions 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales decreased to of sales in from of sales in higher production levels contributed to improved absorption of fixed costs 
additionally  manufacturing costs benefited from our restructuring initiatives  material cost savings associated with engineering design changes and reduced purchase prices and other cost reduction actions

higher sales levels  cost reductions and pricing improvement combined to improve gross margin to of sales in from of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses in were higher than in additional compensation and benefit costs are a major reason for the increase 
the improved operating performance in resulted in cash incentive costs of associated with the annual incentive compensation programs while the only expense recorded in for cash incentive compensation was a special discretionary bonus of awarded in the fourth quarter of throughout  we also suspended certain benefits and merit increases and we implemented mandatory unpaid furloughs

as described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item  an exception occurs when there is a pre tax loss from continuing operations and pre tax income in another category such as other comprehensive income oci 
the tax benefit allocated to operations is the amount by which the loss from operations reduces the tax expense recorded with respect to the other category of earnings

in the first quarter of  we again modified our segment reporting to report all of this operation in the commercial vehicle segment 
the initial change was not appropriately reflected in the segment reporting in the financial statements 
we have revised the segment reporting to correct this error 
the impact of these changes was to increase commercial vehicle net sales by  and and segment ebitda by  and for the year ended december   the eleven months ended december  and the one month ended january  with equal offsets to the lvd segment 
these adjustments were not considered material to the periods to which they relate 

table of contents our lvd  power technologies and structures segments principally serve the light vehicle markets 
exclusive of currency effects  sales in declined in lvd  in power technologies and in structures as compared to the combined periods in  all principally due to lower production levels 
improved pricing in our lvd and structures segments helped offset some of the reduction attributed to lower production 
our commercial vehicle segment is heavily concentrated in the north american market where class commercial truck production was down about and classes commercial truck production was down approximately 
the sales decline in commercial vehicle in  exclusive of currency effects  was as the volume reduction associated with lower production levels was partially offset by higher pricing under material cost recovery arrangements 
with its significant european presence  our off highway segment was negatively impacted by weaker international currencies during this period 
excluding this effect  sales were down compared to as demand levels were down to in construction markets and to in agriculture markets 
increased pricing provided a partial offset

lower sales volumes drove the ebitda reduction of in power technologies 
restructuring and cost reduction initiatives began contributing to profit improvement during the second half of and  along with lower warranty expense  helped offset the impact of reduced sales 

table of contents in our commercial vehicle segment  ebitda was relatively comparable to the prior year  but improved as a percent of sales

liquidity common stock offering and debt reduction in september  we completed a common stock offering of million shares at a price per share of  generating net proceeds of the provisions of our term facility required that a minimum of of the net proceeds of the equity offering be used to repay outstanding principal of our term loan 
as a result of previous debt repurchases  approximately of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan was held by a wholly owned non us subsidiary of dana 
accordingly  of the term loan repayment that was made to the lenders was received by this wholly owned non us subsidiary and was used to repay outstanding principal of our term loan held by third parties 
the september equity offering provided the underwriters with an over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares 
the purchase of these additional shares was completed in october  generating additional net proceeds of of these proceeds  was used to repay third party debt principal 
additional debt reduction occurred in when the combination of dana repayments and purchases of debt by a wholly owned non us subsidiary of dana reduced our outstanding principal under our term facility by net of oid of with a cash outlay of amended term facility refinancing and revolving facility amendment in january  we completed an offering of senior unsecured notes senior notes which generated net proceeds of these proceeds were used together with available cash of to repay in full all amounts then outstanding under our amended term facility 
the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes is  with at a fixed interest rate of maturing in and at a fixed rate of maturing in in connection with this refinancing  we amended our revolving credit and guaranty agreement the revolving facility allowing for the issuance of the senior notes 
the revolving facility was amended in february extending the maturity to five years and reducing the aggregate principal amount of the facility from to with the issuance of the senior notes and the amendment and extension of the revolving facility  we have additional flexibility to make acquisitions and other investments  incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends and distributions as long as certain terms and conditions are met 
the maintenance based financial covenants in our prior agreements were replaced with incurrence based financial covenants 
with these actions  we have reduced our overall debt  secured fixed interest rates over the next eight to ten years and increased our financial flexibility by freeing up debt capacity for growth

table of contents operating activities the table above summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows 
exclusive of working capital and reorganization related activity  other cash provided by operations was during and during an increased level of operating earnings and reduced cash used for restructuring were primary factors for the higher level of other cash provided by operations in this was partially offset by a voluntary contribution of to the us pension plans in december working capital provided cash of in and in higher sales levels in as compared to resulted in increased levels of receivables and inventory 
cash of was used in to finance increased receivables  whereas lower sales in drove a reduction in receivables which provided cash of inventory levels at the end of were relatively high in relation to customer requirements 
consequently  concerted efforts to reduce inventory enabled us to generate cash of in excess inventory levels coming into had largely been worked down  so higher sales in resulted in a cash use of to fund inventory 
the cash use in for higher receivables and inventory was more than offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable and other net liabilities of resulting in the net cash provided of in contrast  reduced inventory and other purchases in led to a decrease in accounts payable and other net liabilities which used cash of in  exclusive of working capital and reorganization related activity  other cash provided from operations of compared to a use of for the combined periods of an increased level of operating earnings was the primary factor for the higher level of cash provided in as compared to the prior periods 
as our operational improvements continued  our workforce reduction and other restructuring activities consumed cash of during  an increase of over the combined periods of working capital provided cash of in  whereas cash of was used in the combination of focused operational initiatives and lower sales levels combined to generate cash of in from reductions in inventory 
during  cash of was used to finance increased inventory 
bringing inventories in line with current requirements caused accounts payable to decrease  using cash of in lower sales levels during the latter part of led to a reduction in accounts payable cash use of reductions to receivables generated cash of in and in  again driven primarily by lower sales during the latter part of investing activities proceeds from the sale of the structural products business provided cash of in expenditures for property  plant and equipment were  as compared to in and for the combined periods of as capital expenditures were closely managed and prioritized throughout and financing activities a cash use of in for financing activities was principally due to a use of for long term debt repayment 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we were required to use proceeds from the sale of the structural products business to repay term loan debt 
dividend payments to preferred shareholders also consumed cash of during with used for payment of previously deferred dividends 
partially offsetting these outflows were proceeds of from long term debt issuance 
in  we completed a common stock offering for million shares generating proceeds of net of underwriting fees 
cash of was used in to reduce long term debt  with another being used to reduce short term borrowings 
in  significant cash was provided by financing activities as proceeds from our exit facility and the issuance of preferred stock at emergence exceeded the cash used for the repayment of other debt

notes principal payments on long term debt in place at december  after giving effect to the issuance of the senior notes in january  payments due by period are less than year  years  years  after years for a total of the cash used in the repayment of the term facility in january is included as part of the obligation 
these amounts represent future interest payments based on the debt in place at december  and the interest rates applicable to such debt 
after giving effect to the issuance of the senior notes in january of  the payments are less than year  years  years  after years or a total of capital and operating leases related to real estate  vehicles and other assets 
the unconditional purchase obligations presented are comprised principally of commitments for procurement of fixed assets and the purchase of raw materials 
this amount represents estimated contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans 
we have not estimated non us pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
this amount represents estimated payments under our non us retiree health care programs 
obligations under the non us retiree health care programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of the payments to be made in the future consider recent payment trends and certain of our actuarial assumptions 
there are no expected payments in related to the uncertain tax positions as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of this liability in individual years beyond due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits at december  total preferred dividends accrued but not paid were and at december  and in october  the board of directors authorized an aggregate cash payment of in dividends to shareholders of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock 
the was paid in december to preferred shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  in march and july  our board authorized two dividend payments which were made in april and august at december   we maintained cash balances of on deposit with financial institutions to support surety bonds  letters of credit and bank guarantees and to provide credit enhancements for certain lease agreements 
these surety bonds enable us to self insure our workers compensation obligations 
we accrue the estimated liability for workers compensation claims  including incurred but not reported claims 
accordingly  no significant impact on our financial condition would result if the surety bonds were called 

table of contents we signed a definitive agreement to increase our investment in ddac in february the transaction is subject to chinese government approval and is expected to close during the first half of with a cash payment approximating due at closing 
in february  we completed a transaction with sifco  a brazilian forging and machining supplier to the vehicular markets 
we paid to sifco at closing 
contingencies for a summary of litigation and other contingencies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item we believe that any liabilities beyond the amounts already accrued that may result from these contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations 
critical estimates are those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note to our consolidated financial statements in item income taxes accounting for income taxes is complex  in part because we conduct business globally and therefore file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax provision  uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in our judgment  based upon available information  it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we consider the historical and projected future taxable income or loss in different tax jurisdictions and we review our tax planning strategies 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and other foreign jurisdictions where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
we are regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provisions include amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
see additional discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in note to our consolidated financial statements in item retiree benefits accounting for pensions and opeb involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost to the time period each employee works 
these plan expenses and obligations are dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries and other consultants and are generally calculated independently of funding requirements 
the assumptions used  including inflation  discount rates  investment returns  life expectancies  turnover rates  retirement rates  future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and modified when appropriate based on historical experience  current trends and the future outlook 
changes in one or more of the underlying assumptions could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 

table of contents the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement  turnover and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates are developed based on our actual historical claims experience  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for our largest plans  discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is developed based on a subset of these high quality fixed income investments those with yields between the th and th percentiles 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
for our largest defined benefit pension plans  expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns  the impact of active management and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
opeb benefits are funded as they become due 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under the applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and amortized into expense over future periods 
in  the actual returns on plan assets were better than the expected returns 
the most significant of our funded plans exist in the us and canada 
in our us plans  we maintained a balanced allocation between growth and immunization assets 
growth assets posted double digit returns for the full year 
interest rates declined in which reduced the liability discount rate and increased the present value of our benefit obligations 
this increase in liability was offset partially by positive returns from the treasury strips and long duration fixed income corporate bonds within our portfolio 
in the us the funded status of the pension plans improved as asset returns and a voluntary contribution to the plan outweighed the increase in the liability due to interest rate declines 
in our canadian plans we remain heavily invested in government securities as many of the associated plans continue to be in various stages of settlement under canadian pension regulation 
at the end of  we have significant unrecognized net actuarial losses in aoci  principally in the us these unrecognized losses are being amortized into domestic net periodic pension cost 
this component of pension expense will increase from in to in however  net pension expense will decline in as a result of lower interest costs and a larger asset base 
as such  the us net periodic pension cost before any curtailment impacts is expected to decrease from in to in we estimate that required contributions to our us plans will approximate in a change in the pension discount rate of basis points would result in a change in our pension obligations as of december  of approximately and no change in pension expense 
a basis point change in the rate of return would change pension expense by approximately restructuring actions involving facility closures and employee downsizing and divestitures frequently give rise to adjustments to employee benefit plan obligations  including the recognition of curtailment or settlement gains and losses 
upon the occurrence of these events  the obligations of the employee benefit plans affected by the action are also re measured based on updated assumptions as of the re measurement date 
see additional discussion of our pension and opeb obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements in item goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of october of each year for all of our reporting units  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we use our internal forecasts  which we update monthly  to make our cash flow projections 
these 
table of contents forecasts are based on our knowledge of our customers production forecasts  our assessment of market growth rates  net new business  material and labor cost estimates  cost recovery agreements with customers and our estimate of savings expected from our restructuring activities 
inherent in these forecasts is an assumption of modest economic recovery in and continuing relatively low interest rates which can impact end user purchases 
the most likely factors that would significantly impact our forecasts are changes in customer production levels and loss of significant portions of our business 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value of our off highway reporting unit and our other indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  were reasonable 
there is a significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of these assets at december  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we recorded goodwill impairment of in related to our lvd business segment 
indefinite lived intangible asset valuations are generally based on revenue streams 
we impaired indefinite lived intangible assets by in including related to the sale of substantially all of our structural products business and in the eleven months ended december  long lived assets with definite lives we perform impairment analyses on our property  plant and equipment and our definite lived intangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indications are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount step one test 
we utilize the cash flow projections discussed above for property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangibles 
we group the assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the undiscounted future cash flows using the life of the primary assets 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests and in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review of the carrying value of assets 
warranty costs related to product warranty obligations are estimated and accrued at the time of sale with a charge against cost of sales 
warranty accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate based on occurrences giving rise to potential warranty exposure and associated experience 
warranty accruals and adjustments require significant judgment  including a determination of our involvement in the matter giving rise to the potential warranty issue or claim  our contractual requirements  estimates of units requiring repair and estimates of repair costs 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
contingency reserves we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods 
however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices for products we use in our manufacturing and interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to these risks  we maintain risk management controls to monitor these risks and take appropriate actions to attempt to mitigate such forms of market risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and with a portion of our forecasted sales and purchase transactions 
foreign currency exposures are reviewed monthly and natural offsets are considered prior to entering into forward contracts 
the majority of our exposures are associated with cross currency intercompany loans  intercompany receivable payable balances and third party non us dollar denominated debt 
a instantaneous increase in foreign currency rates versus the us dollar would result in a loss of a decrease in foreign currency rates versus the us dollar would result in a gain of on existing foreign currency derivatives 

table of contents interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate and fair value risk in connection with the issuance of fixed and variable rate debt 
our exposure arises primarily from changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
a basis points instantaneous increase decrease in the interest rate primarily libor underlying our total outstanding debt would result in an annualized increase decrease of less than in interest expense 
the interest on our debt was primarily at a libor rate plus a fixed margin as defined in our amended term loan agreement and the margin did not change 
the offsetting impact of interest income on our cash balances is not considered in the preceding amounts but represents a significant offset to rate changes 
in january  we issued of fixed rate debt and repaid our term loan 
we have included interest rate risk at december  and interest rate risk based on the senior notes in the table below 
forward contracts we began to designate certain of our qualifying currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges in october changes in the fair value of contracts treated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci and are reclassified to earnings in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect earnings 
changes in the fair value of contracts not treated as cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings in the period in which those changes occur 
changes in the fair value of contracts associated with product related transactions are recorded in cost of sales  while those associated with non product transactions are recorded in other income  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item sensitivity the following table summarizes the sensitivities of certain instruments and balances to a change in our libor interest rate or foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on the fair value of fixed rate instruments and cash flow interest expense for variable rate instruments
