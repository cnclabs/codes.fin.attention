you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of video game products primarily for the family oriented  mass market consumer 
we sell our products primarily to large retail chains  specialty retail stores  video game rental outlets and distributors 
we publish video games for almost all major current generation interactive entertainment hardware platforms  including nintendo s ds  dsi and wii  sony s playstation  or ps  and playstation portable  or psp  microsoft s xbox and the personal computer  or pc 
we also publish games for numerous digital platforms  including mobile platforms like iphone  ipad and ipod touch  as well as online platforms such as facebook 
our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points 
due to the larger budget requirements for developing and marketing premium console titles for core gamers  we focus on publishing more casual games targeting mass market consumers 
in some instances  our titles are based on licenses of well known properties and  in other cases based on original properties 
we collaborate and enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of our video games 
our operations involve similar products and customers worldwide 
these products are developed and sold domestically and internationally 
the company is centrally managed and our chief operating decision makers  the chief executive and other officers  use consolidated and other financial information supplemented by sales information by product category  major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance 
accordingly  we operate in a single segment 
net revenues 
our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video games 
we provide video games primarily for the mass market and casual game player 
our revenues are recognized net of estimated provisions for price protection and other allowances 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization and impairment of software development costs and license fees 
a significant component of our cost of sales is product costs 
product costs are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media  royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals 
in cases where we act as a distributor for other publishers products  cost of sales may increase as we acquire products at a higher fixed wholesale price 
while the product costs as a percentage of revenue 
table of contents is higher on these products  we do not incur upfront development and licensing fees or resulting amortization of software development costs 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees future releases 
these expenses may be incurred prior to a game s release 
gross profit 
gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization and impairment of software development and license fees 
development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales 
the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume  which varies by title 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses relate principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers  testing new products and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle as well as costs incurred at our development studio  which was closed in  that are not allocated to games for which technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred are primarily employee related  may include equipment  and are not allocated to cost of sales 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses  including television advertising  the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs 
credits to retailers for trade advertising are a component of these expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs  including corporate executive and support staff  general office expenses  professional fees and various other overhead charges 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  typically represent the second largest component of our general and administrative expenses 
these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games consists of contract termination costs  and the write off of previously capitalized costs  for games that were cancelled prior to their release to market 
we periodically review our games in development and compare the remaining cost to complete each game to projected future net cash flows expected to be generated from sales 
in cases where we don t expect the projected future net cash flows generated from sales to be sufficient to cover the remaining incremental cash obligation to complete the game  we cancel the game  and record a charge to operating expenses 
while we incur a current period charge on these cancellations  we believe we are limiting the overall loss on a game project that is no longer expected to perform as originally expected due to changing market conditions or other factors 
significant management estimates are required in making these assessments  including estimates regarding retailer and customer interest  pricing  competitive game performance  and changing market conditions 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchase order financing arrangements 
income taxes 
income taxes consists of our provision benefit for income taxes and proceeds from the sale of rights to certain net operating loss carryforwards in the state of new jersey 
utilization of our net operating loss nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
due to our history of losses  a valuation allowance sufficient to fully offset our nol and other deferred tax assets has been established under current accounting pronouncements  and this valuation allowance will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

table of contents seasonality and variations in interim quarterly results our quarterly net revenues  gross profit  and operating income are impacted significantly by the seasonality of the retail selling season  and the timing of the release of new titles 
sales of our catalog and other products are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ending january and october  respectively due to increased retail sales during the holiday season 
sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales also generally increase in quarters in which we release significant new titles because of increased sales volume as retailers make purchases to stock their shelves and meet initial demand for the new release 
these quarters also benefit from the higher selling prices that we are able to achieve early in the product s life cycle 
therefore  sales results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for subsequent quarters during the fiscal year 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when risks and rewards of ownership are transferred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have no continuing obligations to the customer  and the collection of related accounts receivable is probable 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date the earliest date these products may be resold by retailers 
revenue for sales of these products is not recognized prior to their street date 
some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer 
generally  we have considered such features to be incidental to our overall product offerings and an inconsequential deliverable 
accordingly  we do not defer any revenue related to products containing these limited online features 
however  in instances where online features or additional functionality is considered a substantive deliverable in addition to the software product  such characteristics will be taken into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
price protection and other allowances 
we generally sell our products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  we provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for benefits received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular advertisement  are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue 
in addition  some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

table of contents our provisions for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience  current sell through of retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the interactive entertainment market  the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
however  actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  this will result in a change in our provisions  which would impact the net revenues and or selling and marketing expenses we report 
for the month periods ended october   and  we provided allowances for future price protection and other allowances of million  million and million  respectively 
the fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above 
we limit our exposure to credit risk by factoring a portion of our receivables to a third party that buys without recourse 
for receivables that are not sold without recourse  we analyze our aged accounts receivables  payment history and other factors to make a determination if collection of receivables is likely  or a provision for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
capitalized software development costs and license fees 
software development costs include development fees  in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers  and  prior to  direct payroll and overhead costs for our internal development studio 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and management expects such costs to be recoverable against future revenues 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs 
commencing upon a related product s release capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii straight line charges over the expected marketable life of the product 
prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset capitalized license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract or when specified milestones or events occur and when no significant performance commitment remains with the licensor 
licenses are expensed to cost of sales at the higher of i the contractual royalty rate based on actual sales or ii an effective rate based upon total projected revenue related to such license 
capitalized software development costs are classified as non current if they relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date 
the amortization period for capitalized software development costs and license fees is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product 
if actual revenues or revised forecasted revenues fall below the initial forecasted revenue for a particular license  the charge to cost of sales may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter 
the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and license fees is evaluated quarterly based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees future releases  in the period such a determination is made 

table of contents these expenses may be incurred prior to a game s release 
if a game is cancelled and never released to market  the amount is expensed to operating costs and expenses loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
as of october   the net carrying value of our licenses and software development costs was million 
if we were required to write off licenses or software development costs  due to changes in market conditions or product acceptance  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
license fees and milestone payments made to our third party developers are typically considered non refundable advances against the total compensation they can earn based upon the sales performance of the products 
any additional royalty or other compensation earned beyond the milestone payments is expensed to cost of sales as incurred 
inventory 
inventory  which consists principally of finished goods  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we estimate the net realizable value of slow moving inventory on a title by title basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including  in the case of stock option awards  estimating expected stock volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
commitments and contingencies 
we record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable

table of contents consists primarily of net revenues for other console and handheld games  such as playstation  xbox and game boy advance  as well as downloadable pc games  distribution fees  licensing fees and peripheral products and accessories 
year ended october  versus year ended october  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended october  decreased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
the million decrease was due primarily to decreased sales of games for the nintendo wii console 
in october  we released two games for the wii platform  jillian michaels fitness ultimatum  and cooking mama world kitchen 
the success of these games  during a time of rapid growth for the wii platform resulted in significant sales during the holiday selling season  and reorders thereafter  impacting the year ended october  comparatively  while we did release a sequel to the jillian michaels game  jillian michaels resolution  for the holiday season  its revenues were substantially lower than the previous year s title  due primarily to similar titles introduced by other publishers at the same time 
also  we did not release a cooking mama title for nintendo wii until babysitting mama was released after the year ended october   in november in addition  the market for wii games generally became more competitive as the platform matured  and the number of games for the consumer to choose from increased 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million for the year ended october  the decrease in gross profit was attributable to the lower net revenues for the year discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was approximately for both the year ended october  and the year ended october   as generally decreased gross profit percentages on sales were offset by lower charges for impairment of capitalized software development and license costs future releases 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales 
significant management estimates are required in making these assessments  including estimates regarding retailer and customer interest  pricing  competitive game performance  and changing market conditions 
in the year ended october   we recorded million of such charges for impaired titles  compared to million for the year ended october  excluding the effects of impairment charges  the decrease in gross profits as a percentage of sales  was primarily attributable to a lower average selling price for wii products during the year ended october   as compared to the year ended october  we attribute the decrease in average selling price to increased competitiveness in the wii marketplace as the console matured 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended october   from million for the year ended october  the decrease was primarily the result of expenses related to our development studio 
after evaluation of the studio s performance  and changes in the availability and cost of development with our third party partners  we reduced the number of personnel at the studio in the second half of additionally  approximately million was expensed for a video game technology project that was terminated during the year ended october  selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october  the million decrease was due primarily to lower advertising media costs of approximately million  lower shipping and commission expense related to lower sales and lower international selling costs due to the company s change in its international business model 
during the year ended october  we ran several television and internet advertising campaigns 
after analyzing the costs and benefits of these programs  we decided to reduce our media related expenditures during the year ended october  in addition  during the year ended october   we reduced sales and other staff in the us  and sales staff in the united kingdom  related to the 
table of contents termination of our direct distribution strategy in europe 
selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october   general and administrative expenses were million  a decrease of million from million for the year ended october  the decrease was due primarily to lower non cash  stock based compensation expense  which amounted to million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
non cash compensation expense for the year ended october  was impacted by the effects of forfeitures from employee terminations during the fiscal year 
settlement of litigation charges 
settlement of litigation charges in the year ended october  represented the change in fair value since october  of one million shares of common stock that were to be issued in settlement of our class action securities litigation 
the shares were issued in march of operating loss 
operating loss for the year ended october  was approximately million  a decrease of million from million for the year ended october  as discussed above  decreased operating expenses during fiscal were partially offset by decreased revenues and gross profits 
interest and financing costs  net 
interest and financing costs were approximately million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october  the decrease was due to lower factoring fees resulting from lower sales 
change in fair value of warrants 
on september   we issued warrants in connection with an equity financing 
the warrants contain a provision that may require settlement by transferring assets 
therefore  they are recorded at fair value as liabilities in accordance with asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity 
we recorded a gain of million for the year ended october   reflecting a decrease in the fair value of the warrants during the year  compared to a charge of million for the year ended october   which reflected an increase in the fair value of warrants during the year 
income taxes 
in december and november  we received proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively  from the sale of the rights to approximately million and million of new jersey state income tax operating loss carryforwards  under the technology business tax certificate program administered by the new jersey economic development authority 
these net proceeds have been recorded as an income tax benefit during the years ended october  and  respectively 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended october  was million  a decrease of million from a net loss of million for the year ended october  the decrease was due primarily to the decreased operating expenses discussed above  together with lower impairment charges and the effects of remeasuring our warrant liability  which more than offset reduced sales and gross profits 
year ended october  versus year ended october  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million for the year ended october  the million increase was due primarily to incremental revenue growth from several successful new releases during the fiscal year  including cooking mama world kitchen for the nintendo wii  gardening mama for the nintendo ds  jillian michaels fitness ultimatum for the nintendo wii released in late october  and another night at the museum battle of the smithsonian 
the impact of these releases  combined with continued strong re order sales for our catalog cooking mama products resulted in growth in net revenues of 
additionally  we released cooking mama shop and chop for the nintendo ds and jillian 
table of contents michaels resolution for the nintendo wii  late in october the release of these two titles contributed to the fiscal revenue growth 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million for the year ended october  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to i an impairment of capitalized software development and license costs of million related to games scheduled for release in that had a carrying value in excess of their fair value based on projected future cash flows  ii the release of certain video games with sales that were inadequate to cover development costs and minimum royalty payments  resulting in gross losses on those games including our house party and major minor s majestic march  and iii higher royalty costs as a percent of net revenues on certain games when compared to the prior year 
product research and development expenses 
research and development costs increased million to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of expenses related to our development studio and approximately million paid to developers for the development of mobile games 
during the year ended october   substantially all of the work performed in the studio was allocated to non capitalizable projects 
therefore  we reduced our personnel used for internal development and incurred approximately million in severance and lease termination costs 
development costs for mobile games were recorded as research and development costs because we were evaluating opportunities in this market and no significant revenue contribution was expected from then current projects 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses increased from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  the increase was due primarily to higher media costs associated with tv and internet advertising campaigns to support the launch of our new cooking mama titles  jillian michaels titles  and the launch of our goplay brand 
the increased expenditures were incurred primarily during the nine months ended july  after an assessment of the market s response to the programs the company reduced the use of media advertising during the fourth quarter of fiscal selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately and for the year ended october  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october   general and administrative expenses were million  a decrease of million from million in the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to lower compensation expenses resulting from incentive compensation plans 
our incentive compensation plan is primarily based on net income generated by the company 
during  we generated a net loss  resulting in significantly lower incentive compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses include million and million of non cash compensation expenses for the years ended october  and  respectively 
settlement of litigation and related charges 
settlement of litigation charges is comprised of million related to the change in fair value of common stock issued in settlement of our class action securities litigation and a gain on the settlement of legal fees of million 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees cancelled games increased to million for the months ended october  from million for the months ended october   due primarily to a higher number of cancelled games in due to changing market conditions 
operating loss income 
operating loss for the year ended october  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended october  the decrease in operating income primarily resulted from the impact of the lower gross profit  higher product research 
table of contents and development expenses  impairment of software development and capitalized licenses and higher selling and marketing expenses discussed above 
interest and financing costs  net 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the increase of million was the result of a higher percentage of our inventory purchases being financed through our purchase order financing facility for seasonal inventory needs  and higher factoring fees related to higher sales volume 
change in fair value of warrants 
on september   we issued warrants in connection with an equity financing 
the warrants contain a provision that may require settlement by transferring assets 
therefore  they are recorded at fair value as liabilities in accordance with asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity 
we recorded an expense of million for the year ended october   reflecting the increase in fair value of the warrants during that period and income of million for the year ended october   reflecting the decrease in fair value of the warrants during that period 
income taxes 
for the year ended october   we did not record any income tax benefit related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because realization of the resulting loss carryforwards cannot be assured 
income taxes for the year ended october  include a gain resulting from proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the rights to approximately million of new jersey state income tax net operating loss carryforwards  under the technology business tax certificate program administered by the new jersey economic development authority 
for the year ended october   we only provided for alternative minimum taxes because our net operating loss carryforwards exceeded our taxable income 
net loss income 
net loss for the year ended october  was million  a decrease of million from net income of million for the comparable period in this decrease was due primarily to the increased operating loss  the settlement of litigation and related charges  net  the increase of net interest and financing expenses and the change in fair value of warrants  partially offset by a gain from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended october   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended october   and net income of million for the year ended october  historically  we have funded our operating losses through sales of our equity and use of our purchase order financing and factor arrangements to satisfy seasonal working capital needs 
we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities in september our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales 
based on our current working capital financing arrangements  level of cash on hand and operating plan  management believes it can operate under the existing level of financing for at least one year 
however  we may be required to modify that plan  or seek outside sources of financing if our operating plan and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to modify our business plan materially  including making reductions in game development and other expenditures 
additionally  we are dependent on our purchase order financing and account receivable factoring agreement to finance our working capital needs  including the purchase of inventory 
if the current level of financing was reduced or we fail to meet our operational objectives  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of october  we had approximately million outstanding under our purchase order financing arrangement  primarily for 
table of contents goods to be received and sold within days of october  we expect continued fluctuations in the use and availability of cash due to the seasonality of our business  timing of receivables collections and working capital needs necessary to finance our business and growth objectives through at least the next year 
to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables 
we also utilize purchase order financing through the factor and through a finance company to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
in connection with these arrangements  the finance company and the factor have a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
under our factoring agreement we have the ability to take cash advances against accounts receivable and inventory of up to million  and the availability of up to million in letters of credit 
the factor  in its sole discretion  can reduce the availability of financing at anytime 
in addition  we have million of availability for letters of credit and purchase order financing with another lender 
we had outstanding advances against accounts receivable of approximately million under our factoring agreement at october  factoring and purchase order financing 
as mentioned above  to provide liquidity  we take advances from our factor and utilize purchase order financing to fund the manufacturing of our products 
under the terms of our factoring agreement  we sell our accounts receivable to the factor 
the factor  in its sole discretion  determines whether or not it will accept the credit risk associated with a receivable 
if the factor does not accept the credit risk on a receivable  we may sell the accounts receivable to the factor while retaining the credit risk 
in both cases we surrender all rights and control over the receivable to the factor 
however  in cases where we retain the credit risk  the amount can be charged back to us in the case of non payment by the customer 
the factor is required to remit payments to us for the accounts receivable purchased from us  provided the customer does not have a valid dispute related to the invoice 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount  adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer  less factor charges of to of the invoiced amount 
in addition  we may request that the factor provide us with cash advances based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
the factor may either accept or reject our request for advances at its discretion 
generally  the factor allowed us to take advances in an amount equal to of net accounts receivable  plus of our inventory balance  up to a maximum of million of our inventory balance 
occasionally the factor allows us to take advances in excess of these amounts for short term working capital needs 
these excess amounts are typically repaid within a day period 
at october   we had no excess advances outstanding 
amounts to be paid to us by the factor for any accounts receivable are offset by any amounts previously advanced by the factor 
the interest rate is prime plus  annually  subject to a floor 
in certain circumstances  an additional annually is charged for advances against inventory 
manufacturers require us to present a letter of credit  or pay cash in advance  in order to manufacture the products required under a purchase order 
we utilize letters of credit either from a finance company or our factor 
the finance company charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days  plus administrative fees 
our factor provides purchase order financing at a cost of of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
when our liquidity position allows  we will pay cash in advance instead of utilizing purchase order financing 
this results in reduced financing and administrative fees associated with purchase order financing 
advances from customers 
on a case by case basis  distributors and other customers have agreed to provide us with cash advances on their orders 
these advances are then applied against future sales 
table of contents to these customers 
in exchange for these advances  we offer these customers beneficial pricing or other considerations 
contingencies and commitments 
at times  we may be a party to routine claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the outcome of any current such routine claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of october   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million on october   compared to million as of october  working capital as of october  was million compared to million at october  operating cash flows 
our principal operating source of cash is from the sales of our interactive entertainment products 
our principal operating uses of cash are for payments associated with third party developers of our software  costs incurred to manufacture  sell and market our video games and general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october   we used approximately million in operating activities  compared to million in the previous year 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities is due primarily to the decreased net loss of million  partially offset by an increase in the net change in the amount invested in capitalized software development and license fees of million 
during the fiscal year ended october   we began investing in several game projects for release in the fiscal year ended october   impacting the cash used during fiscal the change in operating cash flows for the months ended october  was also impacted by changes in other working capital accounts 
increased cash flow from relative decreases in accounts receivable balances and increases in accounts payable and accrued liability balances were partially offset by greater increases in inventory on hand and prepaid balances with manufacturers 
for the year ended october   we used approximately million in operating activities  compared to million for the year ended october  the increase in cash used in operating activities was due primarily to the increased net loss of million  partially offset by a decrease in the net change in the amount invested in capitalized software development and license fees of million 
capitalized software development and license fees increased million for the months ended october   compared to a decrease of million for the months ended october  we generally invest in game development projects with a development time of three to months 
during the fiscal year ended october   we began investing in several game projects for release in the year ended october   resulting in a use of cash  and increase in capitalized software development costs and license fees at october  during fiscal  these amounts were charged to operating expenses  resulting in a non cash charge to net income for the months ended october  we also reduced the amount invested in capitalized software development and license fees  at october   for games to be released in fiscal  based on an assessment of market conditions 
we expect the amount invested in game development to fluctuate based on seasonality  scheduled release dates  and market conditions in the future
