item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our existing debt service obligations 
our annual debt service obligations until november  when our revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature  will be primarily limited to interest and principal payments on multiple series of privately placed senior notes and our outstanding debt securities  with an aggregate principal amount of million  and on borrowings under our billion credit facility of million as of december  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or new acquisitions to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility when it 
table of contents matures in  our private notes when they mature on various dates between and or our debt securities when they mature in and if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations  we expect to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction at all or on a timely basis or on terms  and for proceeds  that are acceptable to us 
these transactions may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect  however  our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to timely refinance our obligations on acceptable terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and could cause us to reduce or discontinue our planned operations 
the costs that we pay for metals fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control  and such fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results  particularly if we cannot pass on higher metal prices to our customers 
we purchase large quantities of aluminum  carbon  alloy and stainless steel and other metals  which we sell to a variety of end users 
the costs to us for these metals and the prices that we charge customers for our products may change depending on many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  raw material costs  customer demand levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations and surcharges imposed by our suppliers 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers with higher selling prices but we may not always be able to do so 
we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and delivery requirements of our customers 
our customers typically purchase products from us pursuant to purchase orders and typically do not enter into long term purchase agreements or arrangements with us 
accordingly  we purchase metal in quantities we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based on information derived from customers  market conditions  historic usage and industry research 
commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment 
during periods of rising prices for metal  we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers immediately 
in addition  when metal prices decline  this could result in lower selling prices for our products and  as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices  lower margins 
consequently  during periods in which we sell this existing inventory  the effects of changing metal prices could adversely affect our operating results 
our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns 
demand for our products is affected by a number of general economic factors 
a decline in economic activity in the us and other markets in which we operate could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the us economy technically entered an economic recession in december and the economic recession spread to many global markets in beginning in the fourth quarter and throughout  the metals industry  including service centers and reliance  felt the effects of the recession 
both demand for our products and pricing levels declined rapidly and significantly 
in addition to reducing our direct business activity  many of our customers were not able to pay us amounts when they became due  further affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
although demand and pricing levels stabilized somewhat during the second half of and continued to improve at a slow but steady rate during and so far in  overall demand for our products continues to be at low levels 
we have little visibility as to the duration of the economic downturn  particularly its continued impact on the non residential construction market  which may cause our financial condition to worsen from current levels and may continue to threaten the financial viability of our customers and their ability to pay us 
the prices of metals are subject to fluctuations in the supply and demand for metals worldwide and changes in the worldwide balance of supply and demand could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
for example  in the past few years  china has significantly increased both its consumption and production of metals and metal products 
initially  china s large and growing demand for metals significantly affected the metals industry by diverting supply to china and contributing to the global increases in metal prices 
with china s increased production of metals  it has become a significant buyer of natural resources and a net exporter of certain metals 
while these developments can affect global pricing  china has not yet had a significant impact on us pricing or the pricing for our products 
future changes in china s general economic conditions or in its production or export of metals could cause fluctuations in metal prices globally  which could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
due to the recent global recession  us mills have significantly reduced their production capacities by idling production lines in an effort to more closely match supply with current demand 
domestic carbon steel mills were operating at less than of capacity in early  which we believe supported pricing levels well above pricing levels that would have developed if capacity had not 
table of contents been reduced 
during the second half of and throughout mill capacity rates have hovered around  led mainly by increased demand for flat rolled products by the auto and appliance industries 
pricing for most products has experienced significant increases in late and early mostly driven by increasing raw material costs as opposed to demand 
however  if mills continue to increase production without a corresponding increase in demand  prices may decline 
global mills may react more irrationally than domestic mills 
additionally  significant currency fluctuations in the united states or abroad could negatively impact our cost of metals and the pricing of our products 
a decline in the dollar relative to foreign currencies may result in increased prices for metals and metal products in the united states and reduce the amount of metal imported into the us as imported metals become relatively more expensive 
if the value of the dollar improves relative to foreign currencies  this may result in increased metal being imported into the us  which in turn may pressure existing domestic prices for metal 
in addition  when prices for metal products in the us are lower than in foreign markets  metals may be sold in the foreign markets rather than in the us  reducing the availability of metal products in the us  which may allow the domestic mills to increase their prices 
we operate in an industry that is subject to cyclical fluctuations and any downturn in general economic conditions or in our customers specific industries could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the metals service center industry is cyclical and impacted by both market demand and metals supply 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states or other countries  or the public perception that these may occur  could decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our pricing 
for example  the recent economic recession significantly impacted our revenue levels due to both demand and pricing level deterioration beginning in the fourth quarter and through the first half of this deterioration also impacted our gross profit and net income levels as we had to lower our selling prices to our customers faster than we received lower cost metal into our inventory 
since the second half of  our inventory costs have been generally in line with our replacement costs  allowing us to improve our gross profit margins to more normal historical levels since the second half of and throughout as previously discussed in item business  industry and market cycles  significant price increases have been announced by our suppliers for carbon steel products in late and early that are raw material cost as opposed to demand driven 
if either demand or pricing were to decline from the current elevated levels that we have observed so far in early  this could reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
we sell many products to industries that are cyclical  such as the non residential construction  semiconductor  energy and transportation industries  including aerospace 
although many of our direct sales are to sub contractors or job shops that may serve many customers and industries  the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  demand for the finished goods manufactured by customers in these industries  which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy  domestic exchange rates  energy prices or other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to accurately project the product needs of our customers over varying lead times or if there is a limited availability of products through allocation by the mills or otherwise  we may not have sufficient inventory to be able to provide products desired by our customers on a timely basis 
in addition  if we are not able to diversify our customer base and or increase sales of products to customers in other industries when one or more of the cyclical industries that we serve are experiencing a decline  our revenues  gross profit and net income may be adversely affected 
we compete with a large number of companies in the metals service center industry  and  if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenues  gross profit and net income may decline 
we compete with a large number of other general line distributors and specialty distributors in the metals service center industry 
competition is based principally on price  inventory availability  timely delivery  customer service  quality and processing capabilities 
competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have more established brand names in the local markets that we serve 
these competitors may be better able to withstand adverse changes in conditions within our customers industries and may have greater operating and financial flexibility than we have 
to compete for customer sales  we may lower prices or offer increased services at a higher cost  which could reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the significantly lower demand levels during and rapidly declining prices escalated competitive pressures  with service centers selling at substantially reduced prices  and sometimes at a loss  in an effort to reduce their high cost inventory and generate cash 
these competitive pressures could intensify again if demand and particularly pricing decline significantly from the elevated levels reached in early any increased competitive pressure could cause our revenues  gross profit and net income to decline further 
if we were to lose any of our primary suppliers or otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of necessary metals on a timely basis  we may not be able to meet our customers needs and may suffer reduced sales 

table of contents we have few long term contracts to purchase metals 
therefore  our primary suppliers of carbon steel  alloy steel  stainless steel  aluminum or other metals could curtail or discontinue their delivery of these metals to us in the quantities we need with little or no notice 
our ability to meet our customers needs and provide value added inventory management services depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of high quality metal products from our suppliers 
if our suppliers experience production problems  lack of capacity or transportation disruptions  the lead times for receiving our supply of metal products could be extended and the cost of our inventory may increase 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our customary suppliers  we may not be able to obtain these metals from acceptable alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules 
even if we do find acceptable alternative suppliers  the process of locating and securing these alternatives may be disruptive to our business  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customers needs and reduce our sales  gross profit and net income 
in addition  if a significant domestic supply source is discontinued and we cannot find acceptable domestic alternatives  we may need to find a foreign source of supply 
using foreign sources of supply could result in longer lead times  increased price volatility  less favorable payment terms  increased exposure to foreign currency movements and certain tariffs and duties and require greater levels of working capital 
alternative sources of supply may not maintain the quality standards that are in place with our current suppliers that could impact our ability to provide the same quality of products to our customers that we have provided in the past  which could cause our customers to move their business to our competitors or to file claims against us  which may be more difficult to pass through to foreign suppliers 
there has been significant consolidation at the metal producer level both globally and within the us this consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers available to us  which could result in increased metals costs to us that we may not be able to pass on to our customers and may limit our ability to obtain the necessary metals to service our customers 
the number of available suppliers may be further reduced if the current economic downturn continues 
lower metal prices and lower demand levels caused certain mills to reduce their production capacity and  in many cases  to operate at a loss  which could cause one or more mills to discontinue operations if the losses continue over an extended period of time or if the mill cannot obtain the necessary financing to fund its operating costs 
we rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them 
we rely on mill certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metal received from our suppliers for resale and generally  consistent with industry practice  do not undertake independent testing of such metals 
we rely on our customers to notify us of any metal that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplying mill 
although our primary sources of products have been domestic mills  we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate 
in the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill certifications or customer specifications  we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers 
however  such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub standard products and possible losses of customers 
moreover  there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill certifications 
in such circumstances  we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry  or do not carry sufficient  insurance 
if we do not successfully implement our acquisition growth strategy  our ability to grow our business could be impaired 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully complete any acquisitions or integrate any other businesses into our operations 
if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates or are otherwise unable to complete acquisitions  we are unlikely to sustain our historical growth rates  and  if we cannot successfully integrate these businesses  we may incur increased or redundant expenses 
moreover  any additional indebtedness we incur to pay for these acquisitions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
because of the recent economic downturn and uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of the eventual recovery  it may be difficult to reach agreement with potential sellers on the appropriate valuation of target companies  which may delay or cancel potential acquisitions 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of that transaction 
historically  we have expanded both through acquisitions and internal growth 
since our initial public offering in september  we have successfully purchased more than businesses 
from to september  we acquired businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and  although we placed acquisitions on hold in because of the poor economic climate  we continued our acquisition activity in and expect to continue to grow our business through acquisitions in the future 
risks we may encounter in acquisitions include 
table of contents the acquired company may not further our business strategy  or we may pay more than it is worth  the acquired company may not perform as anticipated  which could result in an impairment charge or otherwise impact our results of operations  we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to continue purchasing products from us  we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner  we may significantly increase our interest expense  leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or assume existing debt of an acquired company  which  among other things  may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings  we may have multiple and overlapping product lines that may be offered  priced and supported differently  which could cause our gross profit margins to decline  we may have increased inventory exposure for a short time period if the acquired company had significant amounts of material on order  our relationship with current and new employees  customers and suppliers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify risks that could negatively impact our financial condition  we may lose anticipated tax benefits or have additional legal or tax exposures if we have prematurely or improperly combined entities  we may face contingencies related to product liability  intellectual property  financial disclosures  tax positions and accounting practices or internal controls  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties  our management s attention may be diverted by transition or integration issues  and we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or a number of acquisitions 
as a decentralized business  we depend on both senior management and our key operating employees  if we are unable to attract and retain these individuals  our ability to operate and grow our business may be adversely affected 
because of our decentralized operating style  we depend on the efforts of our senior management  including our chairman and chief executive officer  david h 
hannah  our president and chief operating officer  gregg j 
mollins  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  karla lewis  as well as our key operating employees 
we may not be able to retain these individuals or attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our corporate officers or most of our key employees  so they may have less of an incentive to stay with us when presented with alternative employment opportunities 
the compensation of our officers and key employees is heavily dependent on our profitability and in times of reduced profitability this may cause our employees to seek employment opportunities that provide a more stable compensation structure 
in addition  our senior management and key operating employees hold stock options that have vested and may also hold common stock in our employee stock ownership plan 
these individuals may  therefore  be more likely to leave us if the shares of our common stock significantly appreciate in value 
the loss of any key officer or employee will require remaining officers and employees to direct immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement 
our inability to retain members of our senior management or key operating employees or to find adequate replacements for any departing key officer or employee on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business 
we are subject to various environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations  which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures 

table of contents we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  wastewater discharges  underground storage tanks and solid and hazardous waste disposal at or from our facilities 
our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations  including those concerning occupational injury and illness  employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints 
we are also subject to customs and exporting laws and regulations for international shipment of our products 
environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations are comprehensive  complex and frequently changing 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
we may be subject from time to time to administrative and or judicial proceedings or investigations brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters  employee safety and health issues or customs and exporting issues 
proceedings and investigations with respect to environmental matters  any employee safety and health issues or customs and exporting issues could result in substantial costs to us  divert our management s attention and result in significant liabilities  fines or the suspension or interruption of our service center activities 
some of our current properties are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use 
the location of these properties may require us to incur environmental expenditures and to establish accruals for environmental liabilities that arise from causes other than our operations 
in addition  we are currently investigating and remediating contamination in connection with certain properties we have acquired 
our international presence has grown  so the risk of incurring liabilities or fines resulting from non compliance with customs or export laws has increased 
future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their enforcement  new laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to us  could result in material environmental or export compliance or remedial liabilities and costs  constrain our operations or make such operations more costly 
proposed legislation aimed at regulating and taxing carbon emissions may impact both the prices we pay for materials and the volume of business from our customers involved in fossil fuel exploration 
we purchase large quantities of metal from mills whose production costs may increase because of proposed increases in taxation on carbon emissions as a byproduct of the milling process 
such regulation  if passed  may result in significantly higher prices charged to us by the mills for most every type of metal that we sell 
the price that we pay for utilities such as electricity to run our warehouse equipment and fuel to run our delivery trucks and forklifts may rise as well due to increased taxation on the companies who produce and supply these commodities 
we may not be able to fully pass on these costs to our customers without a resulting decline in order volumes  which may adversely impact our profits 
carbon related regulation may also negatively impact domestic exploration efforts 
should such a reduction in domestic exploration occur  we would expect to see a resulting slowdown in sales to our energy end market in general  thus negatively impacting our revenues  gross profit and net income 
our operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue fluctuating  depending on the season 
some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  including customers in the construction and related industries 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of increased vacation days and holiday closures for various customers 
consequently  you should not rely on our results of operations during any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
ongoing tax audits may result in additional taxes 
reliance and our subsidiaries are undergoing various tax audits 
these tax audits could result in additional taxes  plus interest and penalties being assessed against reliance or any of our subsidiaries and the amounts assessed could be material 
damage to our computer infrastructure and software systems could harm our business 
the unavailability of any of our primary information management systems for any significant period of time could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  our ability to deliver products to our customers when needed  collect our receivables and manage inventory levels successfully largely depend on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
through information management systems  we provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel  improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results 
difficulties associated with upgrades  installations of major software or hardware  and integration with new systems could lead to business interruptions that could harm our reputation  increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability 
in addition  these systems are vulnerable to  among other things  damage or interruption from power loss  computer system and network failures  loss of telecommunications services  operator negligence  physical and electronic loss of data  or security breaches and computer viruses 

table of contents we have contracted with third party service providers that provide us with backup systems in the event that our major information management systems are damaged 
the backup facilities and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate 
the value of your investment may be subject to sudden decreases due to the potential volatility of the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including variations in our quarterly results of operations and our leverage position  as well as general economic conditions 
during the last three years our stock price was extremely volatile reaching an all time high of per share in july  declining to per share in november  and then recovering during and and currently trading in the range in early other factors may include matters discussed in other risk factors and the following factors changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors or changes in estimates that we provide in our quarterly earnings release and conference call  developments affecting our company  our customers or our suppliers  changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting our business  press releases  earnings releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry  inability to meet securities analysts and investors quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance  a decline in our credit rating by the rating agencies  damage to our corporate reputation  the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  sales of our common stock by large shareholders or insiders  general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in addition  stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
in the past  some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation  regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful  could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur that might impair the recovery of recorded costs  making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance 
we test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method 
under this method  the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
significant changes in any one of the assumptions made as part of our analysis  which could occur as a result of actual events  or further declines in the market conditions for our products or our common stock could significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
principal shareholders who own a significant number of shares may have interests that conflict with yours 

table of contents periodically  we have one or more shareholders that control or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
individually or together  they may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval 
in deciding how to vote on such matters  these shareholders may be influenced by interests that conflict with yours 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may adversely impact your rights as a holder of reliance common stock 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring reliance  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock and the rights of our shareholders 
we are authorized to issue  shares of preferred stock  no par value  with the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such stock to be determined by our board of directors  without a vote of the holders of common stock 
our board of directors could grant rights to holders of preferred stock to reduce the attractiveness of reliance as a potential takeover target or make the removal of management more difficult 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings and establish a staggered or classified board of directors 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
a shareholder proposal to eliminate the classified board was passed by a majority of the votes cast at our annual meeting of shareholders and a proposed amendment to the company s bylaws to implement this proposal will be presented to the shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders 
in addition  our credit facility and the provisions of our senior private notes and debt securities contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions 
risks related to our debt securities because our senior debt securities and the related guarantees are not secured and are effectively subordinated to the rights of secured creditors  the debt securities and the related guarantees will be subject to the prior claims of any secured creditors  and if a default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the debt securities or the related guarantees 
the notes and the guarantees are unsecured obligations  ranking equally with other senior unsecured indebtedness 
the indenture governing the notes  as well as our credit facility and private placement notes  permit us and the subsidiary guarantors to incur additional secured or unsecured debt under specified circumstances 
if we or the subsidiary guarantors incur additional secured debt  our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors securing such debt will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors 
in the event of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of either reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors  assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the notes and guarantees only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full 
holders of the notes will participate in any remaining assets ratably with all of the respective unsecured and unsubordinated creditors of reliance and the subsidiary guarantors  including trade creditors 
if reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors incurs any additional unsecured obligations that rank equally with the notes  including trade payables  the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed as a result of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up 
if we do not have sufficient assets to pay all creditors of these entities  a portion of the notes outstanding would remain unpaid 
the guarantees may be unenforceable due to fraudulent conveyance statutes and  accordingly  the holders of our debt securities may not have a claim against the subsidiary guarantors 
the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law 
however  a court in some jurisdictions could  under fraudulent conveyance laws  further subordinate or void the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor if it found that such guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder  delay or defraud creditors  or such subsidiary guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee and that the subsidiary guarantor was any of the following insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the guarantee  engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed that it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay such debts at maturity 
if a court were to void the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor as the result of a fraudulent conveyance  or hold it unenforceable for any other reason  holders of the notes would cease to have a claim against that subsidiary guarantor on its guarantee and would be creditors solely of reliance and any other subsidiary guarantor whose guarantee is not voided or held to be unenforceable 

table of contents the guarantees will be released under certain circumstances 
the debt securities will be guaranteed by any subsidiary guarantor for so long as such subsidiary guarantor is a borrower or a guarantor of obligations under our credit agreement and our private notes 
in the event that  for any reason  the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor terminate as a borrower or guarantor under our credit agreement and our private notes  that subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture and its guarantee of the notes will terminate 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to the notes of a series upon legal defeasance of such series or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as it relates to such series 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to each series of notes in connection with any sale or other disposition by reliance of all of the capital stock of that subsidiary guarantor including by way of merger or consolidation or other transaction such that after giving effect to such transaction such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a domestic subsidiary of reliance 
if the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor as a guarantor terminate or are released  the risks applicable to our subsidiaries that are not guarantors will also be applicable to such subsidiary guarantor 
we depend on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the notes 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries may have priority over your claims with respect to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries 
we will therefore be dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations under the notes and to meet our other obligations 
generally  creditors of our subsidiaries will have claims to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries that are superior to the claims of our creditors  except to the extent the claims of our creditors are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the notes 
as of december   reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if reliance expands its international presence at a greater pace than it expands its us presence  a smaller percentage of its consolidated assets may be subject to the guarantee obligations 
in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of reliance  the holders of our notes may not receive any amounts with respect to the notes until after the payment in full of the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors 
we are permitted to incur more debt  which may intensify the risks associated with our current leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt 
subject to certain limitations  our existing credit facility and private notes permit us to incur additional debt 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit the amount of additional debt that we may incur 
if we incur additional debt  the risks associated with our leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt  will increase 
the provisions in the indenture that governs the notes relating to change of control transactions will not necessarily protect the holders of our notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction 
the provisions contained in the indenture will not necessarily afford the holders of our notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction that may adversely affect them  including a reorganization  restructuring  merger or other similar transaction involving reliance 
these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or  even if they do  may not involve a change of the magnitude required under the definition of change of control repurchase event in the indenture to trigger these provisions  notably  that the transactions are accompanied or followed within days by a downgrade in the rating of the notes 
except in the event of a change of control  the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a takeover  recapitalization or similar transaction 
reliance may not be able to repurchase all of the notes upon a change of control repurchase event 
we will be required to offer to repurchase certain outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the indenture dated november  see exhibit included in this annual report on form k 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes in cash at such time or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of 
table of contents other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time 
under the terms of our credit facility  we are prohibited from repurchasing the notes if we are in default under such credit facility 
ratings of our notes may change and affect the market price and marketability of the notes 
the notes are rated by moody s investors service inc and standard poor s 
such ratings are limited in scope  and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes  but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued and subsequently updated or affirmed 
an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions in were much better than in  although well below what we consider to be healthy levels 
we consider the last two months of and all of to be the most difficult operating environment that our company and our industry has ever experienced due to rapid and significant demand and pricing declines resulting from the global economic recession 
beginning in mid both demand and pricing for our products had generally stabilized and we began to see improvements in demand in certain of our end markets that continued through most notably in semiconductor and electronics  energy  oil and gas  aerospace  agriculture and heavy equipment  and toll processing for the automotive and appliance industries 
there was one end market where demand was weaker for us in than in  and that was non residential construction  which happens to be our largest end market 
projects continued to wind down through and the first half of and then bottomed for us in mid activity has remained consistent at these low levels for non residential construction since that time 
although there was positive improvement in many of our end markets in  our total tons sold were up only in from due to our end market and product mix 
this is after we experienced a decrease in our same store tons sold in as compared to pricing rebounded much more than demand during beginning near the end of  mill prices  especially for carbon steel products  which represented of our sales dollars  increased mainly because of increased costs for raw materials globally 
the mills passed their cost increases through to us  and we  in turn passed these increases on to our customers 
prices continued to increase through most of the first half  but then declined mid year when forecasts of a potential double dip recession became prominent 
this pressure on pricing lowered our gross profit margins until the double dip fear subsided and raw material costs again increased 
the mills announced multiple carbon steel price increases late in the fourth quarter  as their raw material costs continued to increase 
this allowed us to increase our selling price to our customers and somewhat improve our december gross profit margins 
however  our gross profit margin was  compared to in the use of lifo inventory valuation results in a better matching of costs and revenues 
however  we believe that our reported gross profit margins  that are on a lifo basis  somewhat distort the true improvement in both demand and pricing in compared to in  our lifo adjustment resulted in expense of million  compared to income of million in a swing of million 
we are pleased with our performance in but look forward to further improvement in demand for all of our end markets 
we will continue to focus on maximizing the profitability of our existing businesses and continued profitable growth through both acquisitions and internal initiatives 
in we again entered the acquisition market  completing two acquisitions in the fourth quarter with a combined transaction value of about million  and we also spent million on capital expenditures 
a significant portion of our capital expenditures related to growth initiatives  including the expansion and relocation of existing facilities  enhancing and adding processing capabilities  penetrating new geographic markets and expanding product offerings at existing locations 
our acquisitions and internal growth initiatives further enhanced our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we believe this diversification makes our financial results less cyclical than others in our industry 
our balance sheet provides significant capacity for us to execute our growth strategies 
our net debt to total capital ratio was only at december  and we had only million of borrowings outstanding on our billion credit facility 
from now through november  we have million of scheduled debt maturities 
we expect to fund these obligations  as well as our working capital  growth and other activities with our cash flow from operations and availability on our credit facility 
we expect to further grow the company in both through accretive acquisitions and internal growth opportunities to enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we believe the improved business climate and credit markets should result in acquisition opportunities that are attractive to us in the future 
we will evaluate these opportunities and pursue those that meet our disciplined acquisition criteria 
our capital expenditure budget is about million  a good portion of which will be invested in new or expanded facilities and state of the art equipment that will allow us to continue to provide superior customer service and the highest quality of processed metals to our existing customers as well as to expand our market share 
we expect a continued slow and steady improvement in demand across our end markets throughout prices are currently at high levels for most products that we sell 
we expect these prices to hold through the first quarter but anticipate there may be 
table of contents downward pressure on pricing for most products later in the second quarter  unless overall demand improves significantly 
however  we expect our average selling price for to be at or above our average selling price 
in an environment of improving demand and moderate price fluctuations  up or down  we anticipate that we will be able to maintain our gross profit margins in a range of to  consistent with our historical results over the past ten years 
we will continue to focus on cost controls and inventory turnover 
all of these factors indicate improved financial results in as compared to  however  until there is significant improvement in demand  especially in the non residential construction market  we expect our results to be below what we believe our true earnings power is  given the current size and breadth of our company 
effect of demand and pricing changes on our operating results customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which then contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars  which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure other than for profit based compensation  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is typically much greater than the effect of volume changes 
in addition  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this usually increases our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
acquisitions on december   through our subsidiary american metals corporation  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of lampros steel  inc lsi and a related interest in lampros steel plate distribution  llc lspd 
lsi specializes in structural steel shapes with a facility located in portland  oregon 
lspd owns a interest in an unconsolidated partnership  lsi plate that is a distributor of carbon steel plate with locations in california and oregon 
the revenue of lsi from december  through december  was approximately million 
effective february  the business conducted by the lsi plate oregon location was moved to lsi in order to achieve certain operational efficiencies 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of diamond consolidated industries  inc and affiliated companies diamond  which now operate as diamond manufacturing company 
the operating divisions consist of diamond manufacturing company located in wyoming  pennsylvania and diamond manufacturing midwest in michigan city  indiana  both of which specialize in the manufacture and sale of specialty engineered perforated materials  perforated metals plus  a distributor of perforated metals located in charlotte  north carolina  and dependable punch  a manufacturer of custom punches for tools and dies also located in wyoming  pennsylvania 
this acquisition expanded our product and processing offerings with the addition of perforated metals 
net sales of diamond from october  through december  were approximately million 
an operating division of diamond was opened near dallas  texas in early to expand diamond s geographic reach 
we funded our acquisitions with borrowings of approximately million on our billion revolving credit facility 
we also assumed and subsequently repaid million of debt from our acquisitions 
internal growth activities as the economy stabilized in  we maintained our focus on organic growth by opening new facilities  building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of million 
during we also consolidated and closed a few small operations that did not impact our ability to service our customers 
we continued to expand our geographic presence as follows 
table of contents chatham steel corporation leased a new facility in south point  ohio and is scheduled to open for business in the first quarter of diamond commenced operations in cedar hill  texas at a newly built facility in february earle m

operations in existing markets were also expanded as follows emj completed construction of its new facility in memphis  tennessee  which is scheduled to commence operations during the first quarter of liebovich bros  inc completed construction of its new rockford  illinois coil processing facility in the fourth quarter of to expand into new product markets it was not previously able to support 
precision flamecutting and steel  inc completed the purchase of land in houston  texas in january  and plans to begin construction of a new  larger and more efficient facility to better service its customers in the area 
yarde metals  inc moved to its new larger and more efficient limerick  pennsylvania facility in october construction was also started in on an expansion of yarde metals existing hartford  connecticut facility  with completion of the project expected during the third quarter of our capital expenditure budget is approximately million with much of this related to internal growth activities comprised of expansions of existing facilities and purchases of equipment as well as establishing a presence in new geographic markets 
we also plan to move out of various leased facilities and into newly built and or purchased ones 
we will continue to evaluate and execute additional growth projects as appropriate  given the economic conditions and outlook at the time

tons sold and average selling price per ton sold amounts exclude our toll processing sales 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a increase in our tons sold and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
in general  demand has been gradually improving since we reached a low in june as the general economy is slowly recovering and our customers are buying metal to meet their production needs 
business activity in most all of our markets is better than in  with the exception of non residential construction  which we believe represents about one third of our revenues 
our strongest markets during the year were in energy  oil gas  semiconductor electronics  aerospace  and toll processing  which is primarily related to the auto and appliance industries 
our toll processing volumes in were up from levels 
most of the products we sell had higher average selling prices in compared to levels as a result of increased mill prices over this period 
our major commodity selling prices increased in from levels as follows carbon steel up  aluminum up  stainless steel up  and alloy up 
contributing to the increase in our overall average selling price of was also the shift in our product mix  with our carbon steel sales as a percent of total sales dollars declining to of total sales dollars in from in and stainless steel sales increasing to from 
as stainless steel products generally have higher prices than carbon steel products  this shift in our product mix increased our average price per ton sold 
furthermore  late in  significant price increases were announced by the domestic carbon steel mills due mainly to a rise in scrap and other input costs at the mills  as opposed to higher end use demand 
the prices for carbon steel hot rolled coil have risen from in november to around a ton in february according to american metal market 
many of these increases were announced in december  which allowed us to pass through at least a portion of the increase to our customers and contributed to the increase in our fourth quarter average selling price 
cost of sales 
our total cost of sales increased in to billion compared to billion in the increase in cost of sales in compared to is due to increases in tons sold as well as increased costs for most products we sell see net sales above for trends in the costs of our products from our cost per ton sold increased  relatively consistent with the increase in our average selling price per ton sold of 
also  our lifo reserve adjustment  which is included in our cost of sales and  in effect  reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs  resulted in a charge  or expense of million in compared to a credit  or income of million in the lifo charge  or expense  that we recorded in was the result of increases in our inventory costs at year end as compared to year end levels 
the lifo credit  or income  resulted from significant declines in both cost and quantities of inventory on hand at the end of as compared to the beginning of that year 
our lifo reserve as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased to billion for  compared to billion in our gross profit as a percentage of sales in was compared to in our gross profit margin was positively impacted due to our large lifo adjustment in that period resulting from falling metal prices 
in mid our inventory costs were better aligned with current replacement costs and demand and pricing had generally stabilized 
this allowed us to improve our fifo gross profit margins in the second half that  along with our lifo adjustment  resulted in a gross profit margin of 
our gross profit margin during the first half was relatively consistent with our rate 
although we were operating in a more stable environment during  our gross profit margin narrowed in the second half of the year  which resulted in a gross profit margin of 
the mills announced price reductions early in the third quarter and that  along with the higher cost inventory that we were receiving  pressured our selling prices  resulting in lower gross profit margins than we experienced earlier in late in the fourth quarter mills announced significant increases for certain carbon products  which positively impacted our gross profit margins in december and early see cost of sales above for discussion of our lifo reserve adjustments

our annual consolidated sales of billion were down from  with a decrease in tons sold and a decrease in our average selling price per ton sold 
our sales for and included billion and million  respectively  from the pna companies that we acquired on august  our average selling prices during declined mainly because of the significant mill price reductions for most products that we sell compared to prices for most carbon steel products were rising significantly during the first half of and reached record levels in july subsequently  prices fell rapidly beginning in the fourth quarter and continued to decline through the first half of in the second half there were modest increases in mill prices for certain products

the decline in our same store tons sold was due to the lower demand in all markets that we sell to  mainly because of the global economic recession that significantly impacted our business activity beginning in the fourth quarter

table of contents our outstanding debt at december  was million  up slightly from million at december  we increased our borrowings by approximately million to complete our acquisitions  but were able to keep our outstanding borrowings relatively unchanged from as a result of our positive operating cash flows in on september   we amended our billion revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and placed restrictions on certain uses of cash including cash used for acquisitions  dividends  investments and stock repurchases 
our interest coverage ratio requirement was reduced to a minimum times from times and our leverage ratio requirement was reduced to a maximum of from a maximum of until june   at which time these ratios adjusted back to the pre amendment levels 
with the amendment  our pricing was adjusted to market rates 
additionally  with the amendment of our credit facility  we extended the maturity date by one year from november to november for billion of commitments 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings on our billion revolving credit facility 
our net debt to total capital ratio was as of december   down from our year end rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
on november  we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities  which are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect  wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and any entities that become such subsidiaries during the term of the indenture collectively  the subsidiary guarantors 
none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations 
the senior unsecured notes include provisions that  in the event of a change in control and a downgrade of the company s credit rating  require the company to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding private placement notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in october  million of private placement notes matured and were paid off 
we also had a separate revolving credit facility for operations in canada with a credit limit of cad million with no outstanding borrowings as of december  we subsequently terminated this credit facility in january various other separate revolving credit facilities are in place for our operations in asia and for our operations in the united kingdom with total combined outstanding balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our billion syndicated revolving credit facility and senior notes collectively require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and include change of control provisions  among other things 
the interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was approximately times compared to the debt covenant minimum requirement of times interest coverage ratio is calculated as net income attributable to reliance plus interest expense and provision for income taxes and plus or minus any non operating non recurring loss or gain  respectively  divided by interest expense 
the leverage ratio as of december  calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement was compared to the debt covenant maximum amount of leverage ratio is calculated as total debt  inclusive of capital lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt 
the minimum net worth requirement as of december  was million compared to the reliance shareholders equity balance of billion 
additionally  all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the indenture and the private placement notes 
the subsidiary guarantors  together with reliance  are required collectively to account for at least of the company s consolidated ebitda and of consolidated tangible assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately of our total consolidated ebitda and approximately of total consolidated tangible assets as of december  we were in compliance with all other debt covenants at december  we have million of debt obligations coming due before our credit facility expires in november we are comfortable that we will have adequate cash flow and capacity on our revolving credit facility to fund our debt obligations as well as our working capital  capital expenditures  growth and other needs 
we expect to continue our acquisition and other 
table of contents growth activities in the future and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively 
the letters of credit related to insurance policies  construction projects  and outstanding bonds 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total interest is estimated using applicable rates as of december  for our outstanding fixed and variable rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities 
the majority of our inventory purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit plans for the next ten years 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  pricing in effect at that time for inventory purchase commitments  or due to changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
furthermore  the impact of the recent economic recession was so significant on our business during that our period to period fluctuations experienced throughout that year were not representative of typical seasonal trends experienced in the past 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to billion as of december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur  which might impair the recovery of recorded costs  making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance 
we test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method 
under this method  the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
we perform the required annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of november of each year 
no impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended december   or impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and the current changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to commodity prices  demand and future growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  considerable declines in the market conditions for our products from current levels as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies 
table of contents that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports along with current economic pressures impacting that customer or industry 
accounts that we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories a significant portion of our inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in our cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals industry as well as fluctuations in our product mix and on hand inventory levels 
at december   cost on the first in  first out fifo method exceeded our lifo value of inventories by million 
the calculation of lifo does not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments  except at interim reporting periods 
furthermore  considering that our current inventory values as reflected in our financial statements on a lifo basis are significantly below fifo costs  valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market is also not subject to significant estimates or judgments 
however  we do maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities  provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the reconciliation includes such factors as historical and industry multiples  industry performance statistics  and recent comparable transaction pricing among other information 

table of contents long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
this strategy also limits our exposure to commodity prices to our inventories on hand 
in an environment of increasing material costs our pricing usually increases as we try to maintain the same gross profit percentage and typically generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
in periods where demand deteriorates rapidly and metal prices are declining significantly in a compressed period of time  such as during the last three months of and first half of  a portion of our inventory on hand may be at higher costs than our selling prices  causing a significant adverse effect on our gross profit and pre tax income margins 
however  when prices stabilize and our inventories on hand reflect more current prices  our gross profit margins tend to return to more normalized levels 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations is predominantly in their local currency  the currency effects of translating the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses do impact earnings and resulted in approximately million of gains in and  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  during our primary exposure to foreign currency rates related to our canadian operations that had certain outstanding intercompany borrowings denominated in the us dollar that were not hedged 
this exposure was significantly reduced at the end of as the related balances were paid off 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
as of december   our total variable interest rate debt outstanding amounted to approximately million  which was primarily comprised of the borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on million of debt would result in approximately million of additional interest expense on an annual basis
