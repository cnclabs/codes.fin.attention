the loans are principally secured by collateral consisting of real estate and  generally  accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals of the businesses

the company uses its own employees  outside lawyers and other independent professionals to verify titles and ownership  to file liens and to consummate the transactions 
outside appraisers are also used to assist the company s officials in evaluating the worth of collateral 
the company generally grants loans for a term of one year 
in certain situations the company and its borrowers have mutually agreed to the extension of the loans as a result of the downturn in the economy and the real estate industry in the new york metropolitan area

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb released the authoritative version of its new accounting standards codification asc as the single source for gaap  which replaces all previous gaap accounting standards 
while not intended to change gaap  asc significantly changes the way in which the accounting literature is organized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted asc to reference gaap accounting standards in its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of asc did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management will base the use of estimates on a a preset number of assumptions that consider past experience  b future projections  and c general financial market conditions 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with asc  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
interest income from short term commercial loans is recognized  as earned  over the loan period 
origination fee revenue on short term commercial loans is amortized over the term of the respective note 
the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america

recent technical accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification and hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles under asc asc establishes the fasb standards accounting codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on the company s disclosures of the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued an update to asc this accounting standards update asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value asu amends the provisions in asc related to the fair value measurement of liabilities and clarifies for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
asu is intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities 
asu was effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year asu concerns disclosure only 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which codifies sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r issued in june asu requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  currently  the company believes that the adoption of asu will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued asu  as an amendment to asc this update eliminates the requirement to provide a specific date through which subsequent events were evaluated 
this update was issued to alleviate potential conflicts between asc and sec reporting requirements 
the update was effective upon issuance and has no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  fasb issued asu  entitled disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  which is effective for public entities interim and annual financial statements ending after december  the objective of this amended guidance is for an entity to provide disclosures that facilitate financial statement users evaluation of  the nature of credit risk inherent in the entities portfolio of financing receivables  how risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
existing guidance has been amended to provide enhanced disaggregated disclosures in situations involving impairments or troubled loan restructurings  with the guidance for trouble debt restructuring disclosures delayed pursuant to asu company disclosures herein are based on the company s adoption of asu  and providing disclosures there under that apply to its short term loan portfolio in the current circumstances 
management does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effected  accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is a smaller reporting company as defined by regulation s k and as such  is not providing the information contained in this item pursuant to regulation s k
