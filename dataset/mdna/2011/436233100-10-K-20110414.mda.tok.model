item a 
risk factors 
risks of investing in our shares investments in our common stock are speculative and involve a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following matters  as well as the other information in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  results of operations  financial condition  or prospects could be substantially harmed  which would adversely affect your investment 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business  operating results  financial condition  and prospects 
we have a history of losses in our continuing operations 
we had a loss from continuing operations of approximately million in  million in  and million in we may incur additional losses in the future 
because theatre direct represented a substantial portion of our business  following the broadway sale our business will be substantially different 
theatre direct represented a substantial portion of our business until its sale in december as a result  our operating results for any particular period may not accurately predict our future operating results 
summarized results of our discontinued operations  which include the broadway ticketing business  for   and are set forth in the notes to our financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely effected if i we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of our operations  ii our ability to receive the earn out payments from the sale of the hollywood 
com business is inhibited in any way  iii our ability to receive the dividends and any other distributions from movietickets 
com is inhibited in any way  iv our ability to receive the payments under the credit agreement or the earn outs in connection with the broadway sale is inhibited in any way  v our ability to exercise or put the warrant issued to us in connection with the broadway sale is inhibited in any way  or vi our ad sales division and or our intellectual properties division continue to operate at a loss 
we may not receive the payments due under the credit agreement 
pursuant to the intercreditor agreement  key brand s obligations under the credit agreement are subordinated to up to million of certain senior indebtedness of key brand and our ability to exercise remedies upon a default under the credit agreement are subject to certain limitations 
there can be no assurance that hollywood media will receive all of the payments due under the credit agreement 
the financial condition and performance of key brand and or its subsidiaries and the ability of key brand and or its subsidiaries to satisfy the covenants and obligations in the credit agreement or any other applicable financing agreements could adversely affect key brand s ability to satisfy its obligations under the credit agreement 
payments that we receive under the credit agreement may be reduced if certain adverse ticketing regulations are enacted 
from time to time  state and federal governments consider enacting restrictions or limitations on the amount of service fees that may be charged on the resale of tickets for events 
for example  before  the state of new york capped the amount of the service fees that could be charged on the resale of tickets at to of the face value of the ticket  depending on the size of the venue 
in  the state of new york repealed the cap on service fees for the resale of tickets 
the state of new york is currently conducting a study on the secondary ticket market and may consider enacting regulations on the resale of tickets 
at this time it is unclear what  if any  future ticketing regulations may be enacted by states or the federal government 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement and the credit agreement  upon any adverse change in state or federal ticketing regulations that takes effect before december  that restricts or limits the amount of service fees that may be charged on the resale of tickets  the principal amount of the credit agreement will be reduced by the amount of any such reduction in value up to a maximum of million  and such amount shall be added pro rata to the remaining earn out amounts payable to hollywood media pursuant to the purchase agreement  provided that  there will be no reduction in the amounts due under the credit agreement if the entire earn out has already been earned at the time of any such adverse change 
we may not receive earn out payments 
if theatre direct and its subsidiaries achieve revenues greater than or equal to million in any full fiscal year of theatre direct ending during the period from the closing date of the broadway sale until the end of the tenth full fiscal year of theatre direct which occurs after the closing date of the broadway sale  then key brand will be obligated to pay us million plus the applicable portion of any adjustments under the credit agreement relating to the enactment of adverse ticketing regulations 
if theatre direct and its subsidiaries achieve revenues greater than or equal to million in any full fiscal year of theatre direct ending during the period from the closing date of the broadway sale until the end of the tenth full fiscal year of theatre direct which occurs after the closing date of the broadway sale  then key brand will be obligated to pay us an additional amount equal to million plus the applicable portion of any adjustments under the credit agreement relating to the enactment of adverse ticketing regulations 
r s investments  llc  an entity owned by mitchell rubenstein  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and laurie s 
silvers  our president and vice chairperson of the board  is obligated to pay us up to an additional million in potential earn out payments pursuant to our sale to it of the hollywood 
com business 
there can be no assurance that we will receive all of these earn out payments 
key brand s financial performance and condition will impact key brand s ability to satisfy its obligations under the credit agreement  pay the earn out pursuant to the purchase agreement  and satisfy its other obligations under the purchase agreement 
key brand s financial performance and condition will impact key brand s ability to finance and grow its business  which would impact its ability to i satisfy its obligations under the credit agreement  ii pay the earn out pursuant to the purchase agreement  iii satisfy its other obligations under the purchase agreement 
there can be no assurances that key brand will satisfy any or all of these obligations 
the purchase agreement may expose us to contingent liabilities 
under the purchase agreement  we have agreed to indemnify key brand for a breach or violation of any representation  warranty or covenant made by us in the purchase agreement  for certain broker commissions due in connection with the broadway sale  and for certain tax matters  subject to certain limitations 
significant indemnification claims by key brand could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are unable to compete with theatre direct for years from the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement 
we have agreed that hollywood media will not  and will cause its affiliates as defined in the purchase agreement not to  directly or indirectly  own  manage  engage in  operate  control  work for or participate in the ownership  management  operation or control of  any business  whether in corporate  proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise  engaged in the sales of tickets to live musical  live theatrical or other live entertainment performances in the city of new york  new york or that otherwise competes with the business of theatre direct and its subsidiaries as it exists as of the closing date  subject to certain exceptions  including that there are no restrictions on the sale of advertisements including online advertising 
accordingly  subject to these exceptions  the non competition agreement restricts our ability to engage in any business which competes with theatre direct for years from the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement 
for as long as we remain a public company  we will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements 
our reporting obligations as a us public company were not affected as a result of completing the broadway sale 
for as long as we remain a public company  we have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the exchange act  which includes the filing with the sec of periodic reports  proxy statements and other documents relating to our business  financial conditions and other matters  even though compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome 
following the broadway sale  we may be deemed an investment company and subjected to related restrictions under the investment company act of the regulatory scope of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  which was enacted principally for the purpose of regulating vehicles for pooled investments in securities  extends generally to companies engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities 
the investment company act may  however  also be deemed to be applicable to a company that does not intend to be characterized as an investment company but that  nevertheless  engages in activities that may be deemed to be within the definitional scope of certain provisions of the investment company act 
we believe that our anticipated principal activities following the broadway sale  which include operating the ad sales division and the intellectual properties division  will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that we will not be deemed to be an investment company 
if we are deemed to be an investment company  we may become subject to certain restrictions relating to our activities  including restrictions on the nature of our investments and the issuance of securities 
in addition  the investment company act imposes certain requirements on companies deemed to be within its regulatory scope  including registration as an investment company  adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and compliance with certain reporting  record keeping  voting  proxy  disclosure and other rules and regulations 
in the event of the characterization of hollywood media as an investment company  our inability to satisfy such regulatory requirements  whether on a timely basis or at all  would  under certain circumstances  have a material adverse effect on hollywood media 
because our business is smaller following the broadway sale  there is a possibility that our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq global market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of that market 
our business is now smaller as a result of the broadway sale  and therefore we may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the nasdaq global market 
in the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of the nasdaq global market  our common stock may be delisted from that market 
in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq global market  we must meet the bid price and total shareholders requirements as set forth in nasdaq listing rule a and at least one of the three standards in nasdaq listing rule b 
pursuant to nasdaq listing rule a  the bid price of our common stock cannot fall below per share for consecutive business days and we must have at least total shareholders including both holders of beneficial interest and holders of record 
we believe that if we continue to qualify for listing on the nasdaq global market  we will satisfy the equity standard under nasdaq listing rule b  which requires i stockholders equity of at least million  ii at least  publicly held shares total shares outstanding  less any shares held directly or indirectly by officers  directors or any person who is the beneficial owner of more than of the total shares outstanding of the company  iii market value of publicly held shares of at least million  and iv at least two registered and active market makers 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq global market  we may apply to transfer our common stock listing to the nasdaq capital market 
however  our application may not be granted if we do not satisfy the applicable listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market at the time of the application 
even if we successfully transfer our common stock listing to the nasdaq capital market  but are unable to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement of per share or any of the other continued listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
if our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq stock market  we may apply to transfer our common stock listing to the nyse amex formerly the american stock exchange 
however  our application may not be granted if we do not satisfy the applicable listing requirements for nyse amex at the time of the application 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq global market and we could not satisfy the listing standards of the nasdaq capital market or the nyse amex  trading of our common stock most likely would be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the pink sheets or the otc bulletin board 
such trading could reduce the market liquidity of our common stock 
as a result  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq global market and we could not satisfy the listing standards of the nasdaq capital market or the nyse amex and the trading price remains below per share  trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the exchange act  which require additional disclosure by broker dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally  any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq stock market that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low priced stocks to their clients 
moreover  various regulations and policies restrict the ability of shareholders to borrow against or margin low priced stocks  and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls 
additionally  because brokers commissions on low priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks  the current price of the common stock can result in an individual shareholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher 
this factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock 
finally  the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by these requirements could discourage broker dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock 
profitability of hollywood media is dependent in part on our ability to reduce corporate overhead costs 
following the broadway sale  we are concentrating on deploying our resources to maximize our profitability through further reducing corporate overhead costs 
because our business is smaller following the broadway sale  we believe that there will be many ways in which corporate overhead costs can be significantly reduced 
however  if we are not successful in fully implementing such cost reductions  our ability to increase the profitability of hollywood media may be impaired 
there can be no assurance that any disposition or other strategic transaction will occur or  if one is undertaken  of its potential terms or timing 
from time to time we explore potential transactions that may help us to realize the full value of our assets in the interest of our shareholders 
there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur or  if one is undertaken  of its potential terms or timing 
for additional information  see the discussion under outlook in the liquidity and capital resources portion of part ii  item of this annual report on form k  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation below 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the book development business 
numerous companies and individuals are engaged in the book development business 
we also compete with a large number of companies that license characters and properties into film  television  books and merchandise 
competition in these businesses is largely based on the number and quality of relationships that we are able to develop with authors and celebrities 
there can be no assurance that our current or future competitors will not be successful in developing relationships with authors and celebrities with whom we have previously had relationships 
our revenues will decrease if we are unable to maintain these relationships or develop new relationships 
we may not be able to successfully protect our trademarks and proprietary rights 
general 
we own trademark registrations in the united states for many of the trademarks that we use and some of our trademarks are registered in select foreign countries 
we have also filed trademark applications in select foreign countries for the mark hollywood media corp 
and others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate protection for these names or other trademarks in the united states or in foreign countries 
many countries have a first to file trademark registration system  and thus we may be prevented from registering our marks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have registered the same or similar marks 
it is possible that our competitors or others will adopt product or service names similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
intellectual properties business 
hollywood media has applied for trademark and copyright protection for its major intellectual property titles 
each of hollywood media and netco partners currently has us registered trademarks as well as pending trademark applications in the us related to its respective business  and they also have foreign registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in several foreign jurisdictions 
as hollywood media s properties are developed  hollywood media intends to apply for further trademark and copyright protection in the united states and certain foreign countries 
copyright protection in the united states on new publications of works for hire extend for a term of years from the date of initial publication or years from the year of creation  whichever expires first 
trademark registration in the united states extends for a period of ten years following the date of registration 
to maintain the registration  affidavits must be filed between the fifth and sixth years following the registration date affirming that the trademark is still in use in commerce and providing evidence of such use 
the trademark registration must be renewed prior to the expiration of the ten year period following the date of registration 
failure to adequately protect these intellectual property rights could result in adverse consequences for these businesses due to the risks described above 
we may become subject to liability for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not bring copyright or trademark infringement claims against us  or claim that our use of certain technology violates a patent 
even if these claims are not meritorious  they could be costly and could divert management s attention from other more productive activities 
if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated a third party s proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses or rights could be obtained on terms satisfactory to us  if at all 
the inability to obtain any required license on satisfactory terms could force us to incur expenses to change the way we operate our businesses 
if our competitors prepare and file applications that claim trademarks owned or registered by us  we may oppose these applications and have to participate in administrative proceedings to determine priority of right in the trademark  which could result in substantial costs to us  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome could require us to license disputed rights from third parties or to cease using such trademarks 
in addition  inasmuch as we license a portion of our content from third parties  our exposure to copyright infringement or right of privacy or publicity actions may increase  because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
we generally obtain representations as to the origins  ownership and right to use such licensed content and generally obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  however  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representation 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of any litigation between such licensors and a third party or between us and a third party will not lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which such indemnification is insufficient  or that we will be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
we are dependent on developing and maintaining strategic relationships with exhibitors and authors 
the success of our operations is dependent in part on movietickets 
com s ability to enter into and maintain strategic relationships and agreements with exhibitors and tekno books ability to develop and execute book projects with authors 
there can be no assurance such relationships with exhibitors and authors will be developed and maintained and  if unable to do so  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our operations could be negatively impacted by systems interruptions 
the hardware and software used in the movietickets 
com business could be damaged by fire  floods  hurricanes  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our websites could also be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems 
these system problems could negatively affect us 
general internet traffic interruptions or delays could also harm the movietickets 
com business 
to the extent movietickets 
com s services are disrupted  movietickets 
com could lose users of its website 
government regulation could impact our business 
the application of existing laws and regulations to the movietickets 
com business relating to issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation  content  sweepstakes  copyrights  trademarks  advertising  and the characteristics and quality of our products and services can be unclear 
several federal laws could have an impact on the movietickets 
com business 
the digital millennium copyright act establishes binding rules that clarify and strengthen protection for copyrighted works in digital form  including works used via the internet and other computer networks 
the child online protection act is intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children 
the children s online privacy protection act of protects the privacy of children using the internet  by requiring  among other things  that in certain specific instances the operator of a website must obtain parental consent before collecting  using or disclosing personal information from children under the age of  the operator of a website to make certain disclosures and notices on the website or online service regarding the collection  use or disclosure of such personal information  and the operator of a website or online service to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality  security and integrity of personal information collected from children under the age of financial institutions in the uk may revoke automatic banker s drafts 
the company s cinemasonline business in the uk has customer relationships who are billed via automatic banker s drafts pursuant to the company s contracts with such customers 
the company currently is reviewing a letter by a uk financial institution which seeks to terminate the company s ability to process banker s drafts through this bank 
if this termination were to occur  it would impact the company s ability to collect on current banker s drafts and future renewal of contracts with its existing customer base in respect of the company s cinemasonline business in the uk we are dependent on mitchell rubenstein and laurie s 
silvers  our founders 
mitchell rubenstein  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and laurie s 
silvers  our vice chairman  president and secretary  have been primarily responsible for our organization and development 
the loss of the services of either of these individuals would hurt our business 
if either of these individuals were to leave hollywood media unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
the employment agreements between hollywood media and each of these individuals provide  among other things  that if we terminate either of these individuals without cause or either of these individuals resign for good reason  the other individual will have the right to resign for good reason 
our ability to attract qualified personnel and retain certain key personnel is critical to our business 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel 
our future operating results will also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  technical  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
our intellectual property business could be harmed by the loss of the services of dr 
martin h 
greenberg  the president of tekno books  who has been primarily responsible for developing relationships with the authors who create our intellectual properties 
dr 
greenberg owns the remaining interest in tekno books which is included in our intellectual properties division 
many of the authors with whom we have relationships are bound to multiple book contracts and our ability to renew these contracts or enter into contracts with new authors would be impaired without the services of dr 
greenberg 
we have authorized but unissued preferred stock  which could affect rights of holders of common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividends  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt 
although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time  we may do so in the future 
shares of preferred stock are also subject to potential issuance under the terms of our shareholders rights plan described below 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws  shareholders rights plan and florida law may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and our shareholders rights plan may discourage takeover attempts and may make it more difficult to change or remove management 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
our bylaws include provisions requiring shareholders to provide specified advance notice to hollywood media of director nominations or proposed business to be transacted at shareholder meetings  in order for a shareholder to make a director nomination or propose meeting business 
under our shareholder s rights plan  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right for each share of common stock 
if certain events  such as a takeover bid not approved by our board  occur  the rights will then entitle most holders to purchase at a specified price  shares of a series of our preferred stock with special voting  dividend and other rights 
in addition  florida s control share acquisitions statute provides that shares acquired in a control share acquisition which excludes transactions approved by our board of directors will not have voting rights unless the voting rights are approved by a majority of the corporation s disinterested shareholders 
a control share acquisition is an acquisition  in whatever form  of voting power in any of the following ranges a at least but less than of all voting power  b at least but less than a majority of all voting power  or c a majority or more of all voting power 
florida s affiliated transactions statute requires approval by disinterested directors or supermajority approval by disinterested shareholders of certain specified transactions between a public corporation and holders of more than of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or their affiliates 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
during the months ended december   the trading price for our common stock on the nasdaq global market ranged from to per share 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as our quarterly operating results  announcements of new products or services  announcements of mergers  acquisitions  strategic alliances  or divestitures and other factors  including similar announcements by other companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock to decrease  regardless of our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity securities 
we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with future financings  acquisitions or other transactions  or pursuant to outstanding stock options  warrants and other convertible securities  and we plan to issue additional stock options and stock grants from time to time to our employees and directors 
we are generally unable to estimate or predict the amount  timing or nature of future issuances or public sales of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
in addition  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
we may require additional capital to finance our operations and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
we may require additional financing in the future 
our long term financial success depends on our ability to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be on favorable terms 
the terms of any financing that we enter into will vary depending on many factors including  among other things  our then current financial condition  the market price of our common stock  and other characteristics and terms of our capital structure including outstanding options and warrants 
we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of equity securities or debt financings 
our issuance of additional equity securities could cause dilution to holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the incurrence of additional debt could increase our interest expense and other debt service obligations and could result in the imposition of covenants that restrict our operational and financial flexibility 
see part ii  item of this annual report on form k management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
changes in securities laws and regulations may increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of and the sec rules promulgated thereunder have imposed increased demands upon  and required ongoing changes in some of our operational systems and processes  corporate governance  and compliance and disclosure processes  and the nasdaq stock market has implemented changes in its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have resulted in  and future changes in such rules may result in  increases in our expenses for information systems  auditing and consulting fees  legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
these developments could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or executive officers 
as a result of our evaluation of internal controls  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
as reported in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the caption item a controls and procedures  hollywood media s management has identified material weaknesses in internal controls and concluded that hollywood media s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls were not effective 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price

critical accounting estimates in response to the sec s release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for compensation and related benefits  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information about our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
allowance and reserves hollywood media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve on notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or debtors to make required payments 
the company s accounting for doubtful accounts and reserve on notes receivable contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts 
when preparing these estimates  management considers a number of factors  including the aging of a customer s account  past transactions with customers and debtors  creditworthiness of specific customers and debtors  historical trends and other information 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance is primarily attributable to receivables due from customers of cinemasonline 
although the company believes its allowance is sufficient  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s million note receivable from key brand entertainment in connection with the company s sale of its broadway ticketing business has been fully reserved 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions 
impairment of goodwill under fasb accounting standard codification topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc  beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value 
as prescribed by asc  we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of fiscal which did not result in an impairment charge 
additionally  hollywood media established october as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date during fiscal and as part of our fiscal annual impairment evaluation  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its cinemasonline business should be written off  and  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment loss of million 
in addition  the company recorded million in additional impairment to goodwill recorded after our acquisition of always independent entertainment corp 
and our intellectual properties segment 
during the second quarter of the company determined that million of the goodwill associated with its movietickets 
com business should be written down based on discounted cash flow being below carrying value and accordingly recorded an impairment loss of million 
for additional information see note investments in and advances to equity method unconsolidated investees in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
as december   we are not aware of any additional items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of hollywood media s goodwill for impairment further 
the goodwill recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was million 
at december  and december  goodwill represented and  respectively  of total assets  which is all related to the ad sales reporting unit 
the fair value of the ad sales reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of the test date by approximately 
future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections  market values and low discount rates could cause the analysis to indicate that hollywood media s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of the goodwill 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
during the period from november  to may   the company s market capitalization periodically fell below the book value of its equity 
the company believes that the disparity between the book value of its assets as compared to the market capitalization of its business is in large part a consequence of market conditions  including perceived risks in the debt markets  the company s industry and the broader economy 
while the company believes that some of these risks are unique to specific companies  some represent global industry risks 
the company believes that there is no fundamental change in our underlying business model or prospects for our company 
we considered the periodic decline in our market capitalization to be temporary and based on general economic conditions and a decline in general investor confidence throughout the market and not based on any events or conditions specific to us 
the company has evaluated the impairment of its goodwill  giving consideration to these risks  and their impact upon the respective reporting units fair values  and has reported impairments where it deems appropriate 
the company believes that the fair value of its remaining reporting units that contain goodwill at december  and exceeded the book value of those units 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations 
we consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
in addition  although not seasonal  our intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis
