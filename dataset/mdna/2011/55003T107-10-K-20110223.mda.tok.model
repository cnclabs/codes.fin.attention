overview and trends lumber liquidators is the largest specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in the united states  based on industry sources and our experience 
we believe we have achieved a reputation for offering great value  superior service and a broad selection of high quality hardwood flooring products 
we offer our products through multiple  complementary channels  including lumber liquidators stores in states at december   a full service call center in toano  virginia  our website and our catalog 
we seek to appeal to customers who desire a high quality product at an attractive value and are willing to travel to less convenient locations to get it 
we sell our products principally to existing homeowners  who we believe represent over of our customer count 
historically  these homeowners are in their mid s or older  are well educated and have been living in their homes for at least several years 
we offer an extensive selection of premium hardwood flooring products under multiple proprietary brands at everyday low prices designed to appeal to a diverse customer base 
substantially all of our products are purchased directly from mills or associated brokers with whom we have cultivated long standing relationships to ensure a consistent supply of high quality product at the lowest prices 
our mill partners are located primarily in north america  south america  asia and australia 
we believe that our vertically integrated business model enables us to offer a broad assortment of high quality products to our customers at a lower cost than our competitors 
we believe that our brands  value proposition and integrated multi channel approach are important competitive advantages in a hardwood flooring market that is highly fragmented 
we compete on the basis of price  quality  selection and availability of the wood flooring that we offer our customers  as well as the level of customer service we can provide 
we position ourselves as hardwood flooring experts and believe our high level of customer service reflects this positioning 
the wood flooring market for homeowners is dependent on home related discretionary spending  which is influenced by a number of complex economic and demographic factors that may vary locally  regionally and nationally 
in  many of the economic indicators associated with the wood flooring market weakened  and in the latter half of  consumer discretionary spending came under pressure 
we expect the weakness to continue in with only gradual improvement throughout the year when comparing to we believe general discretionary spending will improve prior to home related discretionary spending 
we expect to capture share in our market primarily through store base expansion 
we continue to invest in the infrastructure supporting our store growth and operations 
in recent years  our focus has been on product assortment  in stock inventory position  international and domestic logistics  store management training  and an integrated technology solution to support our future growth 
we expect to continue to focus in these areas 
we implemented the first  and most significant  phase of our integrated technology solution in august this implementation included an enhanced point of sale solution across our entire store base  a warehouse management and inventory control system serving our entire distribution network  an integrated merchandising and product allocation system  and certain related management reporting functionality 
we continued to conduct our business without interruption  but the implementation had a pervasive impact across our operations  primarily resulting in reduced productivity in our store and warehouse operations  adversely impacting our results in the second half of by the end of the fourth quarter of  we believe our overall productivity was very close to the pre implementation level  reaching that level in the first quarter of we remain confident in the long term benefits of the integrated solution  and we believe our operations will ultimately benefit from enhancements not available through our previous information system 
we have grown our store base rapidly with approximately of our total store locations opened in the past three years  including new store locations in we believe our existing primary and secondary metropolitan markets will benefit from additional stores  and in  we opened new store locations in these markets 
our experience has shown that our store model is well suited for markets smaller than the primary and secondary metropolitan areas  and going forward  the majority of our new market stores will be located in these smaller markets 
we expect to open to new store locations in each of the next few years  including new store locations in canada  with an approximately equal mix of new markets and existing markets 

table of contents our recent store opening activity is as follows number of stores at january new stores number of stores at december net sales at our comparable stores have been driven by increases in our total sales volume  primarily measured in square footage  partially offset by decreases in our average sale 
we generally consider a store comparable on the first day of the th month of operation 
sales volume increases have come from demand for our expanded assortment of products and the maturation of our store base 
macroeconomic pressures have generally shifted consumer demand towards certain key product lines which have a lower than average retail price 
changes to comparable prior year results are as follows for the year ended december  increase decrease comparable stores net sales customers invoiced average sale average retail price per unit sold approximated by applying our average sale to total net sales at comparable stores average sale is calculated on a total company basis average retail price per unit sold is calculated on a total company basis and excludes certain service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery our cost of sales is driven primarily by the cost of acquiring the products we sell from our suppliers  but also includes international and domestic transportation costs  customs and duty charges  transportation charges from our distribution center to our stores and the cost of delivering product purchases to the customer 
our gross margin is impacted by the cost of sales  the mix of products sold and the average retail price per unit sold 
in  and  our gross margin has been  and  respectively 
significant changes in transportation costs have been the primary driver of the changes in gross margin 
labor costs and advertising expenses have historically been our most significant sg a expenses 
our total labor costs have increased as a percentage of net sales over the last three years due primarily to our store base growth and investment in support infrastructure 
our annual advertising costs have increased as we continue to promote our brand and implement direct sales generation programs in support of our growth  but we continue to leverage national advertising across a larger store base and commit greater resources to our most effective media channels 
our sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales have been  and in  and  respectively 
we expect to expand annual operating margins as we continue to grow our net sales 
in  however  our operating margin decreased to from in  primarily due to certain adverse impacts from the implementation of our integrated technology solution 
our most significant asset is our merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is considered either available for sale or inbound in transit  based on whether we have physically received and inspected the products 
we launched our initiative to strengthen our in stock commitment to our top selling products in the fourth quarter of the increase in available inventory per store is primarily a result of the adverse impact of our reduced productivity 
merchandise inventories and available inventory per store in operation on december were as follows in thousands inventory available for sale inventory inbound in transit total merchandise inventories available inventory per store 
table of contents sap implementation overview 
in june  we signed a software license agreement with sap retail  inc sap for a broad scope of sap retail software products to implement an integrated business solution in multiple phases 
on august   we implemented the first  and most significant  phase  which included an enhanced point of sale solution across our entire store base  a warehouse management and inventory control system serving our entire distribution network  an integrated merchandising and product allocation system  and related management reporting functionality 
these new management information solutions were fully integrated with our website  call center and customer service systems 
all critical information was converted from our previous information system and we have continued to operate our business without interruption since the conversion 
however  the implementation of this system had a pervasive impact across our operations that resulted  primarily  in reduced productivity in our store and warehouse operations  which adversely impacted our results in the second half of this reduction in productivity included the effectiveness of our store operations to satisfy existing customer orders and generate new demand  the efficiency of our product allocation and distribution  and greater allocation of resources required to operate our business 
as additional resources were allocated to address specific areas with reduced productivity  operational efficiency and effectiveness improved 
in addition  general operating familiarity improved with continued execution 
expectations for we expect to return to pre implementation productivity during the first quarter of  and any remaining adverse impacts from the recovery of productivity are expected to be confined to the first half of at the close of the fourth quarter of  we were very near pre implementation productivity 
our open customer demand  as measured by customer deposits on open orders  had nearly returned to historic norms at december   and certain metrics which indicate better servicing of customer interest  including catalog and flooring sample requests  returned to pre implementation levels in december during  functional areas are expected to begin benefitting from the integrated technology solution  though our results of operations may not reflect those benefits until further  we expect certain selling  general administrative sg a expenses  including maintenance contracts and professional fees  to increase at a percentage rate greater than our net sales in as we support our new solution 
we remain confident in the long term benefits of the integrated solution  and we believe our operations will ultimately benefit from enhancements not available through our previous information system 
we expect the sap system to provide support for our future domestic and international growth  allow for complexity in our supply chain  and enhance the information used by our product planning and allocation functions 
we continue to believe these benefits will positively impact net sales and operating margin in future years 
impact on results 
reduced productivity related to our sap implementation impacted both our results of operations for the year ended december  and our financial position at that date 
customer service  demand and conversion we believe our net sales were adversely impacted by the sap implementation due to our lack of productivity 
net sales in both the third and fourth quarter of were adversely impacted by our inconsistent servicing of new demand subsequent to implementation 
though we saw little decline post implementation in the earliest stages of consumer interest  including traffic to our website  we experienced significant monthly decreases in in store catalog and flooring sample requests across our store base 
these in store metrics did not return to pre implementation levels until the month of december 
table of contents customer orders that were placed in the weeks subsequent to implementation  combined with orders outstanding at implementation  resulted in a significant build of both open demand and related customer deposits at the end of the third quarter of further  low productivity across the supply chain and in our stores resulted in us invoicing that demand over a longer period of time 
we estimated that the build in our customer deposits at the end of the third quarter of equated approximately million to million in unrealized net sales 
we believe we realized a substantial portion of that build through net sales in the fourth quarter of and refunded a small portion of the deposits to customers 
however  those net sales were not able to overcome the adverse impact of our inconsistent servicing of new customers in the fourth quarter 
efficient product movement our gross margin was adversely impacted  primarily in the third quarter of  by inefficient product flow immediately before and after the implementation 
prior to implementation  we built in store inventory levels to establish a greater level of safety stock  then significantly reduced product flow in preparation for a physical inventory at points within our distribution network  including our central warehouse operation 
in the first few weeks following implementation  we were not able to re establish the product flow as quickly as expected 
though we returned to anticipated levels of product distribution in september  the unit count shipped during the third quarter of was significantly lower than our expectations 
in addition  delays in shipping products necessary to fulfill orders resulted in our usage of more expedited modes of transportation  generally at higher costs 
the reduction in warehousing and merchandising productivity also impacted our finishing operations for the first few weeks following implementation 
we finished fewer units per hour in comparison to historic norms due to the physical inventory procedures and slower ramp up of operations after implementation 
we estimate these costs reduced gross margin by approximately to basis points for the full year additional supporting resources we allocated a greater amount of internal and external resources than expected to stabilize our system after implementation  support operations and address the loss of productivity in certain key areas 
as a result  our implementation costs increased  and certain sg a expenses were higher than expected 
we believe these non recurring costs were approximately million and included certain warehousing costs  support for store point of sale functionality  additional customer service and certain professional fees 
external factors impacting our business the wood flooring market for homeowners is highly fragmented and dependent on home related discretionary spending  which is influenced by a number of complex economic and demographic factors that may vary locally  regionally and nationally 
we are impacted by home remodeling activity  employment levels  housing turnover  real estate prices  new housing starts  consumer confidence  credit availability and the general health of consumer discretionary spending 
many of the economic indicators associated with the wood flooring market and more generally associated with consumer discretionary spending are weak 
though we believe we have seen signs of stabilization in  the wood flooring market is likely to remain in a weakened state during  with only gradual recovery throughout the year 
we believe the number of independent retailers serving the homeowner based segment of the wood flooring market will continue to decline  however  presenting us with an opportunity for market share growth  primarily through store base expansion 
we also believe that the longer term trends for our industry remain favorable  including customer perception of hardwood flooring as an attractive alternative to other floor coverings  evolution of the hardwood flooring market  overall home improvement spending  and certain demographic trends

risk factors risks related to our business and industry 
in october  a conglomeration of domestic manufacturers of multilayered wood flooring filed a petition for the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties the petition with the united states department of commerce the doc and the united states international trade commission the itc seeking the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties on multilayered wood flooring imported from china 
we  along with a number of entities involved in various aspects of the industry  are opposing the petition 
in december  the itc made a preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that imports of multilayered wood flooring from china have caused injury to the domestic suppliers 
as a result  the doc continues to conduct its countervailing and antidumping duty investigations  with preliminary duty determinations currently expected in march although the scope of products that may be subject to the countervailing and antidumping duties has yet to be determined  approximately of our net sales in were products manufactured in china that may fall within the scope proposed by the conglomeration 
our suppliers of multilayered wood flooring have been actively participating in the itc and doc proceedings 
the preliminary duty determinations are expected in march 
at the time of the preliminary determinations  importers of multilayered wood 
table of contents flooring from china will be required to pay the applicable duty into escrow pending final determinations by the itc 
until the time of the itc s final determinations  which are expected later this year  the doc may make adjustments to its preliminary duty calculations

results of operations the following tables set forth components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales

for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales comparable store net sales increase net sales for increased million  or  over due to an increase of million in non comparable store net sales and an million increase in comparable store net sales 
net sales were impacted by the following the loss of productivity following our sap implementation weakened net sales at comparable stores in the second half of as a result  we reversed a trend in quarterly net sales  which had gradually strengthened each quarter since the beginning of in the first six months  our net sales in comparable stores increased compared to the six months ended june  in contrast  when comparing the third and fourth quarters of to the same six months in  our net sales at comparable stores decreased 
on a quarterly basis  net sales at comparable stores decreased in comparing the third quarters of and  and increased when comparing the fourth quarters of and net sales for benefited from an increase in the number of customers invoiced in our comparable stores 
we believe the increases in the number of customers invoiced resulted from strengthening consumer demand for our expanded assortment of products  and the incremental traffic generated by certain promotional pricing 
as discussed above  the loss of productivity following the sap implementation significantly impacted the number of 
table of contents customers invoiced compared to the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores in the first half of increased compared to the first half of however  in comparing the second half of the years  the number of customers invoiced decreased from to our monthly comparisons of customers invoiced in comparable stores were negative from august through november and returned positive in december  where increased over our average sale in declined in comparison to we believe the decrease in our average sale for the full year is a result of consumer demand shifting our mix of products sold  or sales mix  to certain key product lines which generally have a lower than average retail price per unit 
we believe we have grown our market share in these product lines 
however  the average sale increased each quarter in  from a low of  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
in  the average sale had fallen each quarter  from  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter comparison of  in to  in represented the first year over year increase since the second quarter of the gradual strengthening of our average sale in is also a result of changes in our sales mix  including demand for our hardwood products 
net sales benefited from more consistent in stock positions of certain key product lines  including product lines customers expect to be in stock at a store location  such as laminates  moldings and accessories 
our sales mix of moldings and accessories increased to of total net sales in  from in these benefits were partially offset by full year decreases in certain hardwood product lines 
comparable store net sales benefited from the continued maturation of stores in operation for to months at december   where net sales increased 
net sales at these comparable stores generally increase faster than at our stores in operation for more than months  which decreased in we believe our stores in operation for more than months are more likely to be adversely impacted by the opening of non comparable stores in an existing market 
excluding the net sales of markets which include a non comparable store and at least one comparable store older than months  net sales at these more mature stores increased 
gross profit and gross margin 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin gross profit in increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin decreased basis points in as compared to this decrease was primarily due increased product costs resulting primarily from the following our loss of productivity subsequent to the sap system implementation resulted in less efficient unit flow  including expedited transportation  and reduced gross margin by approximately to basis points 
transportation costs of moving our products from our warehouse in toano to the store locations  between store locations  and to the customer from our store locations are charged to cost of sales as incurred 
these costs increased due to both a per mile increase  primarily due to increases in fuel surcharges  and an increase in the number of miles driven  primarily due to a greater number of units shipped 
the increase in units shipped primarily resulted from a combination of our increase in sales volume  including the sales mix shift to a lower average retail price  and generally higher in store average inventory levels 
inbound transportation costs capitalized into the unit cost of products sold were generally higher in than in international container rates reached a low point against our historic norm in the second half of  rose to a peak well above our historic norm in the summer of and fell back to approximate our historic norm thereafter 
partially offsetting these transportation cost increases were increased direct shipments received by our stores  either through our china consolidation center or direct from the mill to the store 
in  of our unit purchases 
table of contents were received directly at the store  up from in in the second half of  these direct shipments represented of our unit purchases  up from in the second half of our efforts to expand and regionalize our assortment of bellawood products resulted in per unit finishing costs generally higher than those in  primarily due to greater demand for products which are less efficient to finish 
in aggregate  sales mix shifts were neutral to gross margin  including gross margin benefited from our continued efforts to broaden the assortment and strengthen the in stock positions of moldings and accessories  as well as laminates and certain engineered hardwoods  particularly the premium products 
these product lines generally carry a higher than average gross margin 
gross margin was adversely impacted by a strengthening in consumer demand for certain hardwoods  particularly those at the entry level  which generally carry higher than average retail price points  but lower than average gross margins 
liquidation deals  used as promotional opportunities to generate incremental traffic  have generally yielded lower gross margins in than in  and in each year  those gross margins have been lower than average 
operating income and operating margin 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit sg a expenses operating income operating margin operating income for decreased million  or  over as the million increase in gross profit was offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was principally due to the following factors approximately million in incremental expenses related to the sap system implementation 
salaries  commissions and benefits increased million in from the prior year  and as a percentage of net sales  were of net sales for and of net sales for these increases were primarily due to growth in our store base  a greater commitment to in store management and staffing at certain smaller stores  as well as an expanded store training program  labor costs for our distribution  warehousing and finishing functions due primarily to increased sales volume and higher in stock positions of merchandise inventories  and expanded corporate store support infrastructure  partially offset by a significant reduction in accrued executive bonuses 
advertising expenses increased million from to million in  but as a percentage of net sales  declined to for  from for national advertising campaigns were leveraged across a larger store base in comparing to  and in general  both national advertising and direct sales generation programs benefited from lower unit prices 
we continue to believe the overall effectiveness of our advertising spend improved through increases in direct mail  television and internet search 
occupancy costs increased to million  or of net sales for  from million  or of net sales for the increase was primarily due to our store base expansion  partially offset by leverage at comparable stores 
depreciation and amortization increased million but remained a constant of net sales

certain other expenses  including legal and professional fees  increased million in and as a percentage of net sales increased to compared to in the increase was primarily due to higher information technology expenses subsequent to the sap implementation  store base growth and certain bankcard discount rate fees that increased due to greater consumer preference for certain extended term promotional programs

comparable store net sales benefited from the continued maturation of stores in operation for to months at december   where net sales increased 
net sales at these comparable stores generally increase faster than at our stores in operation for more than months  which decreased

gross profit and gross margin 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin gross profit in increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin improved basis points in as compared to primarily due to the following we continued our investment in infrastructure initiatives within key functional areas impacting our product assortment  product flow and commitment to in stock positions  including product planning  allocation and logistics 
as a result  we believe this drove certain sales mix changes  shortened the distance the product travels between the vendor mill and the final sales floor  and reduced the cost of our products and the related transportation 
our efforts to broaden our assortment of moldings and accessories while remaining committed to an available in stock position increased the sales mix of this key product line  which generally carries gross margins higher than our average 
in addition to our efforts to drive sales mix increases in certain key product lines and the premium products within those product lines  we believe the weakness in the macroeconomic environment throughout also resulted in a shift away from certain hardwood product lines that generally carry higher than average retail prices per unit sold  but slightly lower than average gross margins 
together with our logistics initiatives to reduce both domestic and international transportation costs  gross margin in the second half of benefited from favorable international container rates in comparison to the rates impacting we believe lower international container rates in the second half of in comparison to our historic average container rates resulted in up to basis points of gross margin benefit in the third and fourth quarters 
our gross margin in included the net impact of certain special liquidation deals and the retroactive rebate of a bamboo tariff 
in  those special liquidation deals  unique in their unit count  quality and cost  added approximately basis points to gross margin in gross margin for also benefited from the retroactive rebate by approximately basis points

the operating leases generally contain varying renewal provisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or other financing activities with special purpose entities 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements recognition of net sales we recognize net sales for products purchased at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
we recognize service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery  when the service has been rendered 
we report revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities 
net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical sales 
table of contents trends and experience 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in the assumptions underlying our allowance estimates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
in addition  customers who do not take immediate delivery of their purchases are generally required to leave a deposit of up to of the retail sales amount with the balance payable when the products are delivered 
these customer deposits benefit our cash flow and return on investment capital  since we receive partial payment for our customers purchases immediately 
we record these deposits as a liability on our balance sheet under the line item customer deposits and store credits until the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
merchandise inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of merchandise cost or market value 
we determine merchandise cost using the average cost method 
all of the hardwood flooring we purchase from suppliers is either prefinished or unfinished  and in immediate saleable form 
to the extent that we finish and box unfinished products  we include those costs in the average unit cost of related merchandise inventory 
in determining market value  we make judgments and estimates as to the market value of our products  based on factors such as historical results and current sales trends 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in those assumptions in the future may require us to record charges for losses or obsolescence against these assets  but would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
stock based compensation we currently maintain a single equity incentive plan under which we may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options and restricted shares to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize expense for our stock based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the service period of the related stock based compensation award 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes merton valuation model 
in order to determine the related stock based compensation expense  we used the following assumptions for stock options granted during expected life of to years  expected stock price volatility of  risk free interest rates from to  and dividends are not expected to be paid in any year 
the expected stock price volatility range is based on the historical volatilities of companies included in a peer group that was selected by management whose shares or options are publicly available 
the volatilities are estimated for a period of time equal to the expected life of the related option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield of us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is determined by considering the contractual terms  vesting schedule and expectations of future employee behavior 
had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options  our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less 
changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn  and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would be exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable rate of the facility 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit
