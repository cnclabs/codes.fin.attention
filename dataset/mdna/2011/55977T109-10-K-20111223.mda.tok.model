item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for details on these loans  were non performing 
during the year ended september   million had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for fourteen impaired construction loans 
interest income not recorded on non performing construction loans for the year ended september  was  before making a commitment to fund a construction loan  we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser 
we generally also engage an outside engineering firm to review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of a construction loan 
loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method 
we require a personal guarantee from each principal of all of our construction loan borrowers 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long term financing on improved  owner occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost including interest of construction and other assumptions 
if the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property 
additionally  if our estimate of the value of the completed property is inaccurate  our construction loan may exceed the value of the collateral 
commercial business loans 
at september   our commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans 
we make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals  sole proprietorships and small and mid sized businesses 
our commercial business loans include term loans and revolving lines of credit 
the maximum term of a commercial business loan is years 
such loans are generally used for longer term working capital purposes such as purchasing equipment or furniture 
commercial business loans are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest 
the interest rates for adjustable commercial business loans are typically based on the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
when making commercial business loans  we consider the financial strength of the borrower  our lending history with the borrower  the debt service capabilities of the borrower  the projected cash flows of the business and the value and type of the collateral 
commercial business loans generally are secured by a variety of collateral  primarily accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  savings instruments and readily marketable securities 
in addition  we generally require the business principals to execute personal guarantees 
commercial business loans generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans 
unlike residential mortgage loans  which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from his or her employment income  and which are secured by real property with ascertainable value  commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower s business 
as a result  the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the borrower s business 
further  any collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value 
we try to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards 
the maximum amount of a commercial business loan is limited by our loans to one borrower limit  which is of magyar bank s capital  or million currently 
at september   our largest commercial business loan was a million loan to a company that provides janitorial services and was secured by the accounts receivable of the company 
this loan was performing according to its terms at september  at september   three commercial business loans totaling  were non performing 
interest income not recorded on non performing commercial business loans for the year ended september  was  during the year ended september    had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for impaired commercial business loans and  was recovered from a prior year charge off 
home equity lines of credit and other loans 
we originate home equity lines of credit secured by residences located in our market area 
at september   these loans totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio 
the underwriting standards we use for home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant s credit history  an assessment of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations  the ongoing payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the maximum combined first and second mortgage liens loan to value ratio for home equity lines of credit is 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest  indexed to the prime rate  as reported in the wall street journal  with terms of up to years 
the maximum amount of a home equity line of credit loan is limited by our loans to one borrower limit  which is of magyar bank s capital  or million currently 
at september   our largest home equity line of credit was a million loan 
the loan is performing according to its terms at september  at september   all home equity lines of credit were performing in accordance with their terms with the exception of four non performing loans totaling  during the year ended september    had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for one impaired home equity line of credit 
interest income not recorded on non performing home equity lines of credit for the year ended september  was we also originate loans secured by the common stock of publicly traded companies  provided their shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the american stock exchange or the nasdaq stock market  and provided the company is not a banking company 
stock secured loans are interest only and are offered for terms up to twelve months and for adjustable rates of interest indexed to the prime rate  as reported in the wall street journal 
the loan amount is not to exceed of the value of the stock securing the loan at any time 
at september   stock secured loans totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio 
generally  we limit the aggregate amount of loans secured by the common stock of any one corporation to of magyar bank s capital  with the exception of johnson johnson  for which the collateral concentration limit is of magyar bank s capital 
at september   million  or of our loan portfolio  was secured by the common stock of johnson johnson  a new york stock exchange company that operates a number of facilities in our market area and employs a substantial number of residents 
although these loans are underwritten based on the ability of the individual borrower to repay the loan  the concentration of our portfolio secured by this stock subjects us to the risk of a decline in the market price of the stock and  therefore  a reduction in the value of the collateral securing these loans 
as of september   the aggregate loan to value ratio of the stock secured portfolio was 
loan originations  purchases  participations and servicing of loans 
lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations 
all loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans  which is affected by the current and expected future levels of market interest rates 
generally  we retain in our portfolio substantially all loans that we originate 
historically  we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of reselling them in the secondary market 
in the future  however  to help manage our interest rate risk and to increase fee income  we may increase our origination and sale of fixed rate residential loans and commercial business loans guaranteed by the sba 
all one to four family residential mortgage loans that we sell in the secondary market are sold with servicing rights retained pursuant to master commitments negotiated with freddie mac 
we sell our loans to freddie mac without recourse 
no loans were held for sale at september at september   we were servicing loans sold to freddie mac in the amount of million and sba guaranteed loans sold in the amount of million 
loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments  accounting for principal and interest  contacting delinquent mortgagors  supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults  making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans 
from time to time  we will also participate in loans  sometimes as the lead lender 
whether we are the lead lender or not  we underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures 
at september   we had million of loan participation interests in which we were the lead lender  and million in loan participations in which we were not the lead lender 
we have entered into loan participations when the aggregate outstanding balance of a particular customer relationship exceeds our loan to one borrower limit 
all loan participations are loans secured by real estate that adhere to our loan policies 
at september   all participation loans were performing in accordance with their terms 
during the fiscal year ended september   we originated million of fixed rate and adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the fixed rate loans are primarily of loans with terms of years or less 
we also originated million of commercial real estate loans  million of owner occupied construction loans  million of commercial business loans  and  of home equity lines of credit and other loans during the fiscal year ended september  we generally do not purchase residential mortgage loans  except for loans to low income borrowers as part of our community reinvestment act lenders program 
at september   we had million of one to four family residential mortgage loans that were purchased from other lenders 
no loans were purchased in the fiscal year ended september  loan approval procedures and authority 
our lending activities follow written  non discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors 
in the approval process for loans  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan 
to assess an individual borrower s ability to repay  we review income and expense  employment and credit history 
to assess a business entity s ability to repay  we review financial statements including balance sheets  income statements and cash flow statements  rent rolls  other debt service  and projected income and expense 
we generally require appraisals for all real estate securing loans 
appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers who are approved annually by our board of directors 
we require borrowers to obtain title  fire and casualty  general liability  and  if warranted  flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan 
for construction loans  we require a detailed plan and cost review  to be reviewed by an outside engineering firm  and all construction related state and local approvals necessary for a particular project 
our loan approval policies and limits are established by our board of directors 
all loans are approved in accordance with the loan approval policies and limits 
lending authorities are approved annually by the board of directors  and magyar bank lending staff members are authorized to approve loans up to their lending authority limits  provided the loan meets all of our underwriting guidelines 
loan requests for aggregate borrowings up to million must be approved by magyar bank s chief lending officer or president 
other members of our lending staff have lesser amounts of lending authority based on their experience as lending officers 
loan requests for aggregate borrowings up to of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million  must be approved by magyar bank s management loan committee 
the management loan committee is comprised of the president  chief lending officer  chief financial officer and various bank officers appointed by the board of directors 
a quorum of three members including either the president or the chief lending officer is required for all management loan committee meetings 
the directors loan committee must approve all loan requests for aggregate borrowings in excess of of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million 
the board of directors must approve all loan requests for aggregate borrowings in excess of of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million 
asset quality we commence collection efforts when a loan becomes days past due with system generated reminder notices 
subsequent late charge and delinquent notices are issued and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter 
personal  direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process as a courtesy reminder and later to determine the reason for the delinquency and to safeguard our collateral 
when a loan is more than days past due  the credit file is reviewed and  if deemed necessary  information is updated or confirmed and collateral re evaluated 
we make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they are delinquent for more than three months 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed  and further income is recognized only to the extent received 
a summary report of all loans days or more past due is provided to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
if no repayment plan is in process  the file is referred to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts 
non performing assets 
the table on the following page sets forth the amounts and categories of our non performing assets at the dates indicated 
the table includes troubled debt restructurings loans for which a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven and loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates for each date presented

as shown in the table above  our troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets increased million to million at september  from million at september   and increased million from million at september   reflecting the adverse economic conditions affecting borrowers during the great recession 
the repayment of the company s construction loan portfolio is dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loans and has been particularly impacted by the rapid deterioration in the housing market and decreased buyer demand 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of non performing assets 
additional interest income of approximately million and million would have been recorded during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  if the non accrual loans summarized in the above table had performed in accordance with their original terms 
the company accounts for its impaired loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require that a creditor measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate except that  as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price less estimated costs of disposal  or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs of disposal if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company records cash receipts on impaired loans that are non performing as a reduction to principal before applying amounts to interest or late charges unless specifically directed by the bankruptcy court to apply payments otherwise 
the company continues to recognize interest income on impaired loans that are performing 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs occur when a creditor  for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor s financial condition  grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider  such as a below market interest rate  extending the maturity of a loan  or a combination of both 
at september   there were fifteen loans totaling million that were classified as tdrs by the company 
these loans are not included in the non performing loan figures listed above  as they continue to perform under their modified terms 
delinquent loans 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated 
loans delinquent more than three months are generally classified as non accrual loans 
loans delinquent for days days and over total number amount number amount number amount dollars in thousands at september  one to four family residential commercial real estate construction home equity lines of credit commercial business other total at september  one to four family residential commercial real estate construction home equity lines of credit commercial business other total at september  one to four family residential commercial real estate construction home equity lines of credit commercial business other total at september  one to four family residential commercial real estate construction home equity lines of credit commercial business other total at september  one to four family residential commercial real estate construction home equity lines of credit commercial business other total real estate owned 
real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition 
the company held million of real estate owned properties at september  and million of real estate owned properties at september  during the year ended september   the company was able to successfully dispose of nine properties with an aggregate carrying value of million for a net loss of  and the company was able to secure the title for nine other properties totaling million 
other real estate owned at september  consisted of seven residential properties  four substantially completed condominium projects  seventeen real estate lots  and one commercial real estate building 
the bank is determining the proper course of action for its other real estate owned  which may include holding the properties until the real estate market improves  selling the properties to a developer and completing partially completed homes for either rental or sale 
the company also incurred a  write down during the year on one property under contract of sale at september  the property was sold in november further declines in real estate values may result in a charge to expense in the future 
routine holding costs are charged to expense as incurred and improvements to real estate owned that enhance the value of the real estate are capitalized 
classified assets 
federal banking regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered un collectible and of such little value their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
we classify an asset as special mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management s close attention 
while such assets are not impaired  management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed  the value of the asset may deteriorate  adversely affecting the repayment of the asset 
on the basis of our review of assets at september   classified assets consisted of million of special mention assets and million of substandard assets 
we are required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful  as well as for other problem loans 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike impairment allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when we classify problem assets  we are required to determine whether or not impairment exists 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that magyar bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when it is determined that impairment exists  a specific allowance for loss is established 
for collateral dependent loans  the loan is reduced by the impairment amount via a reduction to the loan and the allowance for loan loss 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the new jersey department of banking and insurance and the federal deposit insurance corporation  which can direct us to establish additional loss allowances 
the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
not all classified assets constitute non performing assets 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
management  in determining the allowance for loan losses  considers the losses in our loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable  and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities  along with the general economic and real estate market conditions 
the allowance for loan losses as of september  was maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable 
however  this analysis process is inherently subjective  as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available 
although we believe we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses  future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process  the new jersey department of banking and insurance and the federal deposit insurance corporation will periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

this policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest 
the investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by our board of directors 
while general investment strategies are developed by the asset and liability committee  the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our president and our chief financial officer 
they are responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and only prudent securities are considered for investment 
they are authorized to execute transactions that fall within the scope of the established investment policy up to million per transaction individually or million per transaction jointly 
investment transactions in excess of million must be approved by the asset and liability committee 
investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the board of directors at their regularly scheduled meetings 
our investments portfolio may include us treasury obligations  debt and equity securities issued by various government sponsored enterprises  including fannie mae and freddie mac  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions  overnight and short term loans to other banks  investment grade corporate debt instruments  and municipal securities 
in addition  we may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations and not in excess of magyar bank s tier capital 
the investment policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner  and purchase and sale decisions be based upon a thorough analysis of each security to determine its quality and inherent risks and fit within our overall asset liability management objectives 
the analysis must consider the effect of an investment or sale on our risk based capital and prospects for yield and appreciation 
at september   our securities portfolio totaled million  or of our total assets 
securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale when purchased 
at september   million of our securities were classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost  and million were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
at september   we held no investment securities classified as held for trading 
us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations 
at september   our us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations totaled million  or of our total securities portfolio 
of this amount  million were mortgage backed securities and million were debt securities 
while these securities generally provide lower yields than other securities in our securities portfolio  we hold these securities  to the extent appropriate  for liquidity purposes and as collateral for certain borrowings 
we invest in these securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense  and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by these issuers 
mortgage backed securities 
we purchase mortgage backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities insured or guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae 
to a lesser extent  we also invest in mortgage backed securities issued or sponsored by private issuers 
at september   our mortgage backed securities  including cmos  totaled million  or of our total securities portfolio 
included in this balance was million of mortgage backed securities issued by private issuers 
our policy is to limit purchases of privately issued mortgage backed securities to non high risk securities rated a or higher by a nationally recognized credit rating agency 
high risk securities generally are defined as those exhibiting significantly greater volatility of estimated average life and price due to changes in interest rates than year fixed rate securities 
mortgage backed pass through securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage backed pass through securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages 
as loan payments are made by the borrowers  the principal and interest portion of the payment is passed through to the investor as received 
cmos are also backed by mortgages 
however they differ from mortgage backed pass through securities because the principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages are structured so that they are paid to the security holders of pre determined classes or tranches at a faster or slower pace 
the receipt of these principal and interest payments  which depends on the estimated average life for each class  is contingent on a prepayment speed assumption assigned to the underlying mortgages 
variances between the assumed payment speed and actual payments can significantly alter the average lives of such securities 
mortgage backed securities and cmos generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
however  mortgage backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings and other liabilities 
mortgage backed securities present a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security  which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the net yield on the securities 
there is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if the securities are redeemed by the issuer 
in addition  the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
our mortgage backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of at september  the estimated fair value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio at september  was million  which was million more than the amortized cost of million 
mortgage backed securities in magyar bank s portfolio do not contain sub prime mortgage loans 
corporate and other securities 
at september   we held fair value of million in bonds which are classified as held to maturity and have a total amortized cost value of million  or of our total securities portfolio 
our investment policy allows for the purchase of such instruments and requires that corporate debt obligations be rated in one of the four highest categories by a nationally recognized rating service 
we may invest up to of magyar bank s investment portfolio in corporate debt obligations and up to of magyar bank s capital in any one issuer 
equity securities 
at september   we held no equity securities other than million in federal home loan bank of new york stock 
the investment in federal home loan bank of new york stock is classified as a restricted security  carried at cost and evaluated for impairment 
equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations 
such investments other than the federal home loan bank of new york are carried at their fair value and fluctuations in the fair value of such investments  including temporary declines in value  directly affect our net capital position

deposits  primarily certificates of deposit  have traditionally been the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities 
we obtain certificates of deposit primarily through our branch network and to a lesser extent via the brokered cd market 
we also use borrowings  primarily federal home loan bank advances  to supplement cash flow needs  to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds 
additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities  loan and security prepayments and maturities  income on other earning assets and stockholders equity 
while cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds  deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates  market conditions and levels of competition 
deposits 
our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area 
we offer a selection of deposit accounts  including demand accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  retirement accounts and certificates of deposit 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
historically  we also accepted brokered deposits and did so when attractive rates were available 
at september   we had million in brokered deposits as compared to million at september  the company is restricted from accepting new brokered deposits or renewing its existing brokered deposits in accordance with the consent orders see supervision and regulation general 
interest rates  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis 
deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates  liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors and growth goals 
personalized customer service  long standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program are relied upon to attract and retain deposits 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand 
based on experience  we believe that our deposits are relatively stable 
however  the ability to attract and maintain deposits  and the rates paid on these deposits  has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions 
at september   million  or of our deposit accounts  were certificates of deposit including individual retirement accounts

for all other banks  the minimum leverage capital requirement is  unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the depository institution

the risk based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital  which is defined as the sum of tier capital and tier capital  to risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  plus certain off balance sheet items  are multiplied by a risk weight of to  based on the risks the federal deposit insurance corporation believes are inherent in the type of asset or item

prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit improvement act also established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
the federal deposit insurance corporation  as well as the other federal banking regulators  adopted regulations governing the supervisory actions that may be taken against undercapitalized institutions 
the regulations establish five categories  consisting of well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the federal deposit insurance corporation s regulations define the five capital categories as follows an institution will be treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is at least  and its ratio of tier capital to total assets is at least  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the federal deposit insurance corporation to meet a specific capital level  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  or capital directive issued by the federal deposit insurance corporation to meet and maintain a specific capital level

an institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if its total risk based capital is less than  its tier capital is less than  or its leverage ratio is less than

the federal deposit insurance corporation is required  with some exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized 
for this purpose  critically undercapitalized means having a ratio of tangible capital to total assets of less than 
the federal deposit insurance corporation may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events  including insolvency  or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business  and insufficient capital  or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance

federal law and federal deposit insurance corporation regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state chartered federal deposit insurance corporation insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries  unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or the federal deposit insurance corporation regulations  an insured bank must seek approval from the federal deposit insurance corporation to make such investment or engage in such activity

the fdic lowered assessment rates to between and basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category  and to to basis points for banks in the highest risk category 
the final rule eliminated the adjustment to the rate paid for secured liabilities  including federal home loan bank advances  since these are now part of the new assessment base 
on november   the fdic approved a final rule requiring insured depository institutions to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of were based upon the assessment rate in effect on september   with three basis points added for the and assessment rates

in connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank  the federal deposit insurance corporation is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
among other things  the current community reinvestment act regulations replace the prior process based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the current evaluation system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices

generally  such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
an exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank 
in addition  federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavourable features

such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the federal reserve board  that has received a composite or rating  as well as a satisfactory rating for management  at its most recent bank holding company inspection by the federal reserve board  and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
in addition  a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulation  is generally prohibited from engaging in  or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non banking activities 
one of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible 
some of the principal activities that the federal reserve board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are making or servicing loans  performing certain data processing services  providing discount brokerage services  or acting as fiduciary  investment or financial advisor  leasing personal or real property  making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare  and acquiring a savings and loan association 
bank holding companies that elect to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature 
magyar bancorp  inc has not elected to be a financial holding company  although it may seek to do so in the future 
bank holding companies may elect to become a financial holding company if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well managed  each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating at its most recent examination  and the bank holding company has filed a certification with the federal reserve board stating that it elects to become a financial holding company 
under federal law  depository institutions are liable to the federal deposit insurance corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the federal deposit insurance corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the federal deposit insurance corporation to such an institution in danger of default 
this law would be applicable potentially to magyar bancorp  inc if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to magyar bank 
it has been the policy of many mutual holding companies to waive the receipt of dividends declared by its subsidiary 
in connection with its approval of the reorganization  however  the federal reserve board required magyar bancorp  mhc to obtain prior federal reserve board approval before it may waive any dividends 
as of the date hereof  federal reserve board policy is to prohibit a mutual holding company from waiving the receipt of dividends from its holding company or bank subsidiary  and management is not aware of any instance in which the federal reserve board has given its approval for a mutual holding company to waive dividends 
additionally  under federal deposit insurance corporation policy  the cumulative amount of waived dividends  if any  must not be available for distribution to public stockholders 
see supervision and regulation holding company regulation 
it is not currently intended that magyar bancorp  mhc will waive dividends declared by magyar bancorp  inc as long as magyar bancorp  mhc is regulated by the federal reserve board 
conversion of magyar bancorp  mhc to stock form 
magyar bancorp  mhc is permitted to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization a conversion transaction 
there can be no assurance when  if ever  a conversion transaction will occur  and the board of directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a conversion transaction 
in a conversion transaction a new stock holding company may be formed as the successor to magyar bancorp  inc the new holding company  magyar bancorp  mhc s corporate existence would end  and certain depositors of magyar bank would receive the right to subscribe for additional shares of the new holding company 
in a conversion transaction  each share of common stock held by stockholders other than magyar bancorp  mhc minority stockholders would be converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that minority stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in magyar bancorp  inc immediately before the conversion transaction  subject to any adjustment required by regulation or regulatory policy 
the federal deposit insurance corporation will require that dividends waived by magyar bancorp  mhc be taken into account 
the total number of shares held by minority stockholders after a conversion transaction also would be increased by any purchases by minority stockholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the conversion transaction 
any conversion transaction would require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of magyar bancorp  inc common stock held by minority stockholders and the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of depositors of magyar bank

risk factors changes in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values 
our earnings largely depend on our net interest income  which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
while we have taken steps to attempt to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  historically our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets 
this imbalance can create significant earnings volatility  because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities 
likewise  in a period of falling interest rates  the interest expense paid on our liabilities may not decrease as rapidly as the interest income received on our assets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management of market risk 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage backed securities 
a reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities as borrowers tend to refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs 
this creates reinvestment risk  which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
at september   the fair value of our total securities portfolio was million 
the unrealized net gain on securities totaled million on a pre tax basis at september  we evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate the change in magyar bank s net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
at september   in the event of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates  the model projects that we would experience an  or  decrease in net interest income in the first year following the change in interest rates  and a  or  decrease in net interest income in the second year following the change in interest rates 
at september   in the event of an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates  the model projects that we would experience an  or  decrease in net interest income in the first year following the change in interest rates  and a  or  decrease in net interest income in the second year following the change in interest rates 
at september   our available for sale securities portfolio totaled million  which included million of mortgage backed securities 
to the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available for sale portfolio decreases  our stockholders equity will be adversely affected 
because we intend to continue our emphasis on the origination of commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans  our lending risk has increased in recent years and may increase in future years 
at september   our portfolio of commercial business and commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of our total loans  compared to million or of our total loans at september  and million or of our total loans at september  it is our intent to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial business and commercial real estate loans 
commercial business and commercial real estate loans generally have more risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
at september   our non performing loans increased to million from million at september  but have decreased from million at september  because the repayment of these loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses  repayment of these loans has been and may continue to be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy 
further  these loans typically have larger loan balances  and several of our borrowers have more than one commercial business and commercial real estate loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
finally  if we foreclose on a commercial business or commercial real estate loan  our holding period for the collateral  if any  typically is longer than for one to four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral 
because we plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these loans  it may be necessary to increase our allowance for loan losses because of the increased credit risk associated with these types of loans 
any increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings 
the financial sector is experiencing an economic downturn 
a deterioration of our current non performing loans or an increase in the number of non performing loans will have an adverse effect on our operations 
virtually all of our real estate loans are secured by real estate in new jersey 
at september   loans secured by real estate  including home equity loans and lines of credit  represented of our total loans 
both nationally and in the state of new jersey we are experiencing an economic downturn that is having a significant impact on the prices of real estate and related assets 
the residential and commercial real estate sectors have been adversely affected by weakening economic conditions  which may negatively impact our loan portfolio 
troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets increased from million at september  to million at september  troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased to at september  as compared to at september  if loans that are currently non performing further deteriorate or loans that are currently performing become non performing loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses  which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our fdic premium could be substantially higher in the future  which would have an adverse effect on our future earnings 
our fdic insurance assessment was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year our fdic assessment could be higher in future periods depending on the premium rates set by the fdic for such periods and the composite rating assigned to the bank by the fdic 
any increases in our fdic premium rates will reduce future earnings 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  requiring additions to our allowance  which could materially decrease our net income 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans and of total non performing loans at september  we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
based on this review  we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses in our loan portfolio as of september  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
in our market area  we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets 
for additional information see business of magyar bank competition 
if we declare dividends on our common stock  magyar bancorp  mhc will be prohibited from waiving the receipt of dividends by current federal reserve board policy  which may result in lower dividends for all other stockholders 
the board of directors of magyar bancorp  inc will have the authority to declare dividends on its common stock  subject to statutory and regulatory requirements 
so long as magyar bancorp  mhc is regulated by the federal reserve board  if magyar bancorp  inc pays dividends to its stockholders  it also will be required to pay dividends to magyar bancorp  mhc  unless magyar bancorp  mhc is permitted by the federal reserve board to waive the receipt of dividends 
the federal reserve board s current position is to not permit a mutual holding company to waive dividends declared by its subsidiary 
accordingly  because dividends will be required to be paid to magyar bancorp  mhc along with all other stockholders  the amount of dividends available for all other shareholders will be less than if magyar bancorp  mhc were permitted to waive the receipt of dividends 
magyar bancorp  mhc exercises voting control over magyar bancorp  inc  public stockholders own a minority interest 
magyar bancorp  mhc owns a majority of magyar bancorp  inc s common stock and  through its board of directors  exercises voting control over the outcome of all matters put to a vote of stock holders including the election of directors  except for matters that require a vote greater than a majority 
public stockholders own a minority of the outstanding shares of magyar bancorp  inc s common stock 
the same directors and officers who manage magyar bancorp  inc and magyar bank also manage magyar bancorp  mhc 
in addition  regulatory restrictions applicable to magyar bancorp  mhc prohibit the sale of magyar bancorp  inc unless the mutual holding company first undertakes a second step conversion 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
magyar bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the new jersey department of banking and insurance  its chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  which insures magyar bank s deposits 
as a bank holding company  magyar bancorp  inc is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which financial institutions and their holding companies may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of financial institutions  the classification of assets by financial institutions and the adequacy of financial institutions allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  could have a material impact on magyar bank and magyar bancorp  inc magyar bank s operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal  state and local governmental authorities  and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on operations 
these laws  rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that changes to existing laws  rules and regulations  or any other new laws  rules or regulations  will not be adopted in the future  which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
we are subject to consent orders  which place limits on our operations  increase our compliance expense and could result in penalties or further restrictions if we fail to comply with their terms 
on april   magyar bank entered into agreements with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance that require magyar bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
in connection with these agreements  magyar bank stipulated to the issuance by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance of consent orders against magyar bank relating to findings from an examination of magyar bank that occurred in while the consent orders imposed no fines or penalties upon magyar bank  the consent orders require corrective actions  including that magyar bank develop a written capital plan to achieve tier capital as a percentage of total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least  levels of capital greater than those required for a new jersey savings bank to be classified as well capitalized 
under the consent orders  magyar bank also agreed  among other things  to develop and implement a plan to reduce the bank s delinquent and non accrual loans and risk exposure in certain classified assets  to develop and implement a plan to reduce commercial real estate loan concentrations and the bank s concentration of bank owned life insurance  to make certain revisions to the bank s loan policies and procedures and methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses  to develop and implement a strategic plan  a profit plan and a liquidity and funds management plan that conform to specified requirements in the consent orders  and to correct and prevent all unsafe or unsound banking practices  violations of law and regulations and policies discussed in the examination report 
the consent orders restrict magyar bank from declaring or paying cash dividends  soliciting  accepting or renewing brokered deposits  and extending additional credit to certain types of borrowers 
because the consent orders place limitations and restrictions on our operations  including our lending and borrowing operations  the consent orders could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans  including potential profitable growth strategies that we might otherwise pursue  which may adversely affect our financial performance 
for example  our capital plan required by the consent orders states that the higher capital ratios will be achieved and maintained by september  the higher capital ratios may reduce our origination of loans  including attractive loans that we would otherwise make 
further  the consent orders require us to reduce our concentrations of commercial real estate loans  even potentially profitable ones 
in addition  the consent orders require us to reduce classified  delinquent and nonaccrual loans within specified time frames 
these time frames could result in our inability to maximize the price that we might otherwise receive for the sale of the underlying collateral 
finally  the consent orders restriction on brokered deposits may affect our ability to have sufficient liquid assets for our operations or require us to pay higher rates on retail deposits to replace our use of brokered deposits 
to comply with the consent orders  magyar bank has incurred and expects to continue to incur consulting and legal fees 
notwithstanding these fees  there can be no assurance that we will achieve full compliance with the requirements of the consent orders  nor can we estimate when the consent orders will be lifted 
if we fail to comply with the provisions of the consent orders  we could be subject to additional restrictions or penalties  including civil money penalties on us and our directors and officers  and the removal of directors and officers from their positions with magyar bancorp  inc and magyar bank 
government responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and earnings 
new financial reform legislation has been enacted by congress that will change the bank regulatory framework  create an independent consumer protection bureau that will assume the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies  and establish more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies 
the legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending  funding  trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies 
bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations 
ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets  and the effect of new legislation and regulatory actions in response to these conditions  may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities  including our ability to originate or sell loans  modify loan terms  or foreclose on property securing loans 
these measures are likely to increase our costs of doing business and may have a significant adverse effect on our lending activities  financial performance and operating flexibility 
in addition  these risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios  which also would negatively affect our financial performance 
furthermore  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  in an attempt to help stabilize the economy  has  among other things  kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise  which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
in addition  deflationary pressures  while possibly lowering our operating costs  could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers  especially our business borrowers  and the values of underlying collateral securing loans  which could negatively affect our financial performance 
it is difficult to predict at this time what impact the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks  including the lending and credit practices of such banks 
moreover  many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for at least a year  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those provisions relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau  will increase our operating and compliance costs 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other us government agencies linked to long term us debt 
instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions  including the bank 
these downgrades could adversely affect the market value of such instruments  and could adversely impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments  as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available 
we cannot predict if  when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions 
these ratings downgrades could result in a significant adverse impact to the company  and could exacerbate the other risks to which the company is subject to

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview magyar bancorp  inc the company is a delaware chartered mid tier stock holding company whose most significant business activity is ownership of of the common stock of magyar bank 
magyar bank s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations  principal repayments on loans and securities and borrowed funds  into one to four family residential mortgage loans  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  commercial business loans and construction loans 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest income is primarily affected by the market interest rate environment  the shape of the us treasury yield curve  the timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets 
other factors that may affect our results of operations are general and local economic and competitive conditions  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
on april   the bank entered into agreements with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance which require the bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
in connection with these agreements  the bank stipulated to the issuance of consent orders against the bank the consent orders relating to certain findings from a recent examination of the bank 
in entering into the stipulation and consenting to entry of the consent orders  the bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions therein 
the consent orders impose no fines or penalties upon the bank 
among the corrective actions required were for the bank to develop  within days of the april  effective date of the consent orders  a written capital plan that details the manner in which the bank will achieve a tier capital as a percentage of the bank s total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least 
for purposes of the consent orders  tier capital  qualifying total capital  total assets  and risk weighted assets shall be calculated in accordance with part of the fdic rules and regulations  cfr part the bank developed and filed a capital plan on a timely basis with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
at september   the bank s tier capital as a percentage of the bank s total assets was  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets was 
during the year ended september   we decreased net loans million  or  primarily due to a million  or  decrease in construction loans 
the contraction in the construction loan portfolio was due to the decision to cease originations of new construction loans in based on the adverse economic environment and its impact on this type of lending 
due to the difficult economic environment and the need to increase capital ratios  the repayments of these loans were used to shrink the bank s balance sheet by reducing higher cost borrowings and deposits 
borrowing decreased million  or  and deposits decreased million  or  during the year ended september  balances of certificates of deposit including individual retirement accounts declined million  or  reflecting the bank s continued strategy of shifting funding sources from higher cost certificates of deposit and borrowings to lower cost checking and money market accounts  which increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the year 
the shift in funding helped contribute to a million  or  decrease in the company s interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  we attribute the decrease in the average interest expense to the expansion of our commercial relationships  which tend to hold larger deposit balances  successful business development efforts by our retail branch managers  and the continued growth of the bank s two newest branch facilities 
we reported a net loss of  for the year ended september  net income decreased million for the year ended september  compared with the year ended september   attributable to a million decrease in income tax benefit  a  increase in other expense and a  decrease in other income 
loan loss provisions decreased  to million during the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  due to lower level of loan charge offs and the decrease in the total loan receivables during the current period  specifically construction loan balances  which required higher levels of reserves 
throughout  we expect to continue the resolution of non performing assets  diversifying our balance sheet with higher concentrations in commercial real estate and commercial business loans  and managing non interest expenses in order to increase profitability of the company 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies may involve complex subjective decisions or assessments 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical 
due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses  the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic and industry concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
the evaluation has a specific and general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows 
specific impairment allowances are established as required by this analysis 
however  the bank s federal and state regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired loans be charged off  reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general portion of the reserve 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses may be significantly greater than the allowances we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
deferred income taxes 
the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities i are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns  ii are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and iii are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment 
the valuation allowance is adjusted  by a charge or credit to income tax expense  as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september total assets 
total assets decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   due to reductions in loans receivable  partially offset by an increase in investment securities 
loans receivable 
net loans receivable decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  during the year ended september   construction loans decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  in addition  one to four family residential mortgage loans decreased million  or  to million from million  while home equity line of credit and other loans decreased million  or  to million from million

non performing loans consisted of fifteen construction loan relationships totaling million  twelve mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaling million  nine commercial real estate loans totaling million  four home equity lines of credit totaling  and three commercial business loan totaling  adverse economic conditions have led to high levels of non performing loans  particularly in the company s construction loan portfolio 
the repayment of construction loans is typically dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loan  which has been negatively impacted by significant deterioration in the housing market and decreased buyer demand 
as a result  construction projects have slowed and reached their maturity dates 
in order for the company to extend the loans beyond the original maturity date  the value of the collateral securing the loan must be assessed  which is typically done by obtaining an updated third party appraisal 
given the deterioration in the economy and  specifically  the housing market  updated valuations of the collateral reflect depreciation from earlier assessments 
to the extent that the current appraised value of collateral is insufficient to cover a collateral dependent loan  the company reduces the balance of the loan via a charge to the allowance for loan loss

construction loans may contain interest reserves on which the interest is capitalized 
at september   there was one performing construction loan with an interest reserve representing an outstanding balance of  an original interest reserve of  an advanced interest reserve of  and a remaining interest reserve balance of  at september   there were four performing construction loans with interest reserves representing outstanding balances of million  original interest reserves of million  advanced interest reserves of  and remaining interest reserve balances of  underwriting for construction loans with and without interest reserves has followed a uniform process 
construction loan progress is monitored by loan on a monthly basis by management of the bank as well as by the board of directors 
each time an advance is requested  an inspection is made of the project by an outside engineer or appraiser  depending on the size and complexity of the project  to determine the amount of work completed and if the costs to date are supported adequately 
the bank s construction loan operations personnel compare the advance request with the original budget and remaining loan funds available to ensure the project is in balance and that at all times the amount remaining on the loan is sufficient to complete the project 
a number of the bank s construction loans have been extended due to slower sales as a result of worsening economic conditions 
in cases where updated appraisals reflect collateral values insufficient to cover the loan  additional collateral and or a principal reduction is required to extend the loan 
some of the bank s loans that originally had interest reserves are non performing 
the bank does not currently have any non performing loans with active interest reserves 
once a loan is deemed impaired  any interest reserve is frozen and the loan is placed on non accrual so that no future interest income is recorded on these loans

the decrease was attributable to a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of loans as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on such loans to from 
the decline in yield on loans reflected the lower interest rate environment for loans during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  interest earned on investment securities  excluding federal home loan bank of new york stock  decreased  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year 
the decrease was due to an basis point decrease in the average yield on securities to from for the prior year period which more than offset a million  or  increase in the average balance of investment secuities to million from million for the prior year

we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to earnings  at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur 
after an evaluation of these factors  management made a provision of million for the year ended september  compared with a million provision for the prior year 
provisions for loan loss decreased  due to lower levels of loan charge offs during the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september   lower levels of construction loans and lower levels of loan receivables 
there were net charge offs of million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of million for the year ended september  the lower level of loan charge offs resulted from fewer impaired loans at september   in comparison with september   and lower charge offs of previously impaired loans in comparison to the prior year period 
total non performing and restructured loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  excluding troubled debt restructurings non performing loans increased  or  to million 
the allowance for loan losses decreased  to million  or of gross loans outstanding at september   from million  or of gross loans outstanding at september  the decline in the allowance for loan loss was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the construction loan portfolio during the year ended september  other income 
non interest income decreased  or  to million during the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease in non interest income for the year was attributable to lower gains on the sales of assets  which were  for the year ended september  compared with  for the year ended september  the company s gains from the sales of investment securities decreased  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the gains resulted from sales of mortgage backed securities in the current lower interest rate environment

other expense increased  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to increases of  in oreo expenses   in compensation and employee benefits   in occupancy expense  and  in other expenses 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in fdic insurance premiums of  and professional fees of  oreo expense increased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  due to an increase in the balance of oreo to million from million during the same period 
oreo expenses include real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  utilities  and general maintenance and upkeep expenses 
employee and benefit expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was the result of the opening and staffing of branch offices in bridgewater and north edison in september and july  respectively 
the operation of these branches contributed to a  or  increase in occupancy expense to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year period 
other expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year period 
the increase was primarily the result of higher expenses associated with the collection and administration of non performing loans  which increased  the fdic insurance assessments paid by the bank decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year period 
the decrease resulted from a lower assessment base as well as lower assessment rates during the second half of the company s fiscal year 
professional fees decreased  or  to million during the year ended september  from the prior year period 
the decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower expenses related to the use of attorneys in the collection of non performing loans and the foreclosure of collateral securing non performing loans

the million tax benefit for the year ended september  resulted primarily from a partial reduction in the valuation allowance previously recorded against its deferred tax asset 
management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset and liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset and liability committee meets at least on a quarterly basis to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by retaining in our loan portfolio fewer fixed rate residential loans  by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in the residential  construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios  by using alternative funding sources  such as advances from the federal home loan bank of new york  to match fund longer term residential and commercial mortgage loans  and by originating and retaining variable rate home equity and short term and medium term fixed rate commercial business loans 
we have also increased money market account deposits as a percentage of our total deposits 
money market accounts offer a variable rate based on market indications 
finally  we have purchased interest rate floors and sold securities under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rates on our prime based loans 
at september  we held securities sold under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives in the amount of million 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are well positioned to react to changes in market interest rates 
net interest income analysis 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the estimated changes in our net interest income nii for each of the next two years that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in interest rates 
these estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage related investment prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates  and deposit maturities and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions 
further  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
change in estimated decrease estimated decrease interest rates estimated in nii year estimated in nii year basis points nii year amount percentage nii year amount percentage dollars in thousands unchanged assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of of assets or greater 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by determining the sum of the difference between liquid assets cash and unpledged investment securities and short term liabilities estimated day deposit outflows  borrowing capacity from the fhlbny  and brokered deposit capacity and dividing the sum by total assets 
at september   our liquidity ratio was of assets 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity from sales  totaled million at september  at september   we also had the ability to borrow million from the federal home loan bank of new york 
on that date  we had an aggregate of million in advances outstanding 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our statements of cash flows included in our financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan origination commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  that based on past experience a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
for the year ended september   we originated million of loans and purchased million of securities 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended september  and a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of new york  which provide an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank advances totaled million and million at september  and september   respectively 
federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand 
magyar bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure as well as consent orders that require magyar bank to develop a written capital plan that details the manner in which the bank will achieve tier capital as a percentage of the bank s total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least which exceed the required regulatory capital ratios 
a capital plan was submitted on a timely basis to the federal deposit insurance corporation and new jersey department of banking of insurance and called for the bank to achieve these higher capital ratios by september  as of september   magyar bank s tier capital as a percentage of the bank s total assets was and the total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets was

we have minimized our credit exposure by choosing carriers that are highly rated and limiting the concentration of any one carrier 
the investment in bank owned life insurance has no significant impact on our capital and liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us 
for additional information  see note p  lease commitments  and note q financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to our financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment
