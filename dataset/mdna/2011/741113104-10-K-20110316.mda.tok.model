overview of the company the company is a provider of high technology  digital based printing solutions to the commercial print segment of the graphic communications industry 
the company designs  manufactures and distributes proprietary and non proprietary solutions aimed at serving the needs of a wide range of print service providers worldwide 
our proprietary digital imaging and advanced technology consumables offer superior business solutions for commercial printing focusing on the growing need for short run  high quality color applications 
we have helped to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment  workflow and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through streamlined operations and chemistry free  environmentally responsible solutions 
we are also a leading sales and service channel across a broadly served market in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing segments 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables model 
in this model  approximately two thirds of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a di press or a ctp system generally results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
we also provide consumables for use on equipment purchased by end users from other manufacturers and suppliers 
through our various operations  we provide advanced digital print solutions through the development  manufacture  and sourcing of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free and chemistry based printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  and are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide 
we have developed the enabling technology for di digital offset presses 
di presses are presstek s proprietary system by which digital images are transferred directly onto printing plates that are already mounted on press 
our advanced di presses are a waterless  easy to use  high quality printing press that is fully automated and provides our users with competitive advantages over alternative print technologies 
we believe that our di digital offset presses  in combination with our proprietary printing plates and streamlined workflow  produces a superior offset printing solution 
by combining advanced digital technology with the reliability and economic advantages of offset printing  we believe our customers are better able to grow their businesses  generate higher profits and better serve the needs of their customers 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
we also design and manufacture ctp systems that incorporate our technology to image our chemistry free printing plates 
our chemistry free digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
we have executed a major transformation in the way we go to market 
in the past  we had been reliant on oem partners to deliver our business solutions to customers 
today  more than of our sales are through our own distribution channels 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and the analog consumables are manufactured by either us or our strategic partners 
the addition of these non proprietary products and our ability to directly sell and service them was made possible by the ab dick acquisition and precision acquisition  which we completed in we currently have one reporting segment  the presstek segment 
presstek is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sourcing  sale and servicing of our business solutions using patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies 
we also provide traditional analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries 
we generate revenue through three main sources i the sale of our equipment and related workflow software  including di presses and ctp devices  ii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iii the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
prior to march   we conducted business in two segments the presstek segment  and the lasertel segment 
lasertel manufactured and developed high powered laser diodes and related laser products 
on september   the board of directors approved a plan to market the lasertel subsidiary for sale  as such the company has presented the results of operations of this subsidiary within discontinued operations 
on march   the lasertel subsidiary was sold to selex as previously discussed 
commencing with the second quarter of the fiscal  the company s reports filed with the sec reflect that the company conducts business in one industry segment as a result of its sale of lasertel 
strategy our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices  as well as the servicing of customers using our business solutions 
to complement our direct sales efforts  in certain territories  we maintain relationships with key press manufacturers such as ryobi  heidelberg  and kba  who market printing presses and or press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop and distribute consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices ie  open platform plates 
in addition to expanding the base of our di and ctp units  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our thermal plate offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our aurora pro chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with ctp units manufactured by other thermal ctp device manufacturers 
in december we introduced aeon  a no preheat thermal ctp plate that offers run lengths to  without baking 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
during fiscal we took a major step forward in our up market growth strategy with the introduction of the new presstek di digital offset press 
the di incorporates presstek s next generation imaging technology and di thermal plates into a larger six page format 
this new larger format press  which can also be purchased with integrated aqueous coating capability  will provide us greater access to the up market  larger customers 
since  management has been taking steps to improve the company s cost structure and strengthen its balance sheet in order to enable presstek to improve profitability and strengthen its overall financial position 
our reduced cost levels and balance sheet improvements to date are  in large part  the result of our cost reduction initiatives as described in more detail below  as well as a continuing focused effort to review and manage working capital 
fiscal highlights the worldwide economic conditions continued to adversely impact our business in overall commercial print industry volume was low again as companies held back on general advertising and promotional materials  and uncertainty regarding the economy and tightening credit markets led to delays in capital purchase decisions 
as a result of the continuing economic crisis  as well as continuing erosion due to technological changes impacting our traditional product business  revenues in fiscal of million were down million  or  compared to the prior year 
management objectives our vision is to provide high quality  fully integrated digital solutions and services that enable us to form an all encompassing relationship with our customers 
our business strategy is to offer innovative digital imaging and plate technologies that address the opportunities of today and tomorrow in the graphic arts and commercial printing markets across the globe 
this strategy includes several imperatives focus on the growth of our consumables product line  emphasize attractive market segments such as larger print providers and global sales expansion  focus on growing existing segments such as print shops with less than employees  enable customers to better compete by offering a more diverse range of products  continue to expand solutions that meet the growth in demand for short run  fast turnaround high quality color printing  and provide environmentally responsible solutions through our application of technology 
cost reduction initiatives over the last three years  we initiated a series of cost reduction and business improvement initiatives that have involved virtually every aspect of the business 
these initiatives have included pricing actions  improved manufacturing efficiencies  increased utilization of field service resources  right sizing of operating expenses  elimination of the k company matching contribution  furloughs in certain of the company s operating areas and cash flow improvements driven by working capital reductions and the sale of selected real estate assets 
the company has generated approximately million of annualized savings margin improvements as a result of these actions 
the company has made significant improvements to its cost structure as a result of these cost reduction initiatives 
since the second quarter of  headcount has been reduced by  leased facilities have been consolidated  operating expenses have been reduced from million in the second quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decline of  working capital has decreased from million at june  to million at january   total debt has decreased since the second quarter of to million  and the company completed the sale of its real estate located in tucson  az for million in fiscal and the sale of its lasertel subsidiary in for million in cash and  in addition  presstek was able to retain approximately million of laser diode inventory 
use of non gaap measures adjusted ebitda is a financial measure which is not prescribed or authorized by united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
adjusted ebitda  as we define it  reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  restructuring and special charges and other non recurring charges or credits 
our credit agreement includes a similar measure as a basis for a material covenant under the agreement 
additionally  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
additionally  we believe that investors commonly adjust ebitda information to eliminate the effect of restructuring and other expenses  which vary widely from company to company and impair comparability 
we adjust for these items in our adjusted ebitda as our management believes that these items would distort their ability to efficiently view and assess our core operating trends 
in summary  our management uses adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends  as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  and in communications with our board of directors  shareholders  creditors  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda was positive million  negative million and positive million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the following table represents a reconciliation of gaap amounts net income loss from continuing operations to non gaap amounts adjusted ebitda for fiscal years  and in thousands of dollars 
net income loss from continuing operations add back interest expense  net provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization non cash portion of equity compensation impairment and other non cash charges restructuring and other charges adjusted ebitda includes charges for bonus plan payable in presstek stock and stock based compensation includes a customer bad debt charge in and goodwill write off and inventory charge in adjusted ebitda reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  non cash portion of equity compensation  restructuring and special charges and other non recurring charges or credits

liquidity the primary sources of the company s liquidity are i cash generated by the company s operations and ii a million revolving credit and security agreement with a term that expires on march  credit agreement 
the company utilizes its sources of liquidity to fund current operations and make capital and other investments in support of the business 
on march   the company entered into the credit agreement among the company and pnc bank  national association pnc  as lender and as administrative agent for lenders pnc  in such agency capacity  the agent 
the credit agreement  maturing three years from the inception date  provides for funding of up to million through a revolving credit facility the revolver 
borrowing availability under the revolver is determined based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the company may terminate the credit agreement at any time prior to the maturity date upon thirty days prior written notice and upon payment in full of all outstanding obligations under the credit agreement 
if the company terminates the credit agreement within the first months the company must pay an early termination fee as specified in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires the company to prepay a portion of borrowings under the credit agreement out of the proceeds of certain dispositions of property 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the revolving interest rate 
the revolving interest rate is calculated differently for domestic rate loans and for eurodollar rate loans 
for domestic rate loans the interest rate per annum is equal to the sum of the alternate base rate plus two and one half percent 
the alternate base rate is defined as a rate per annum  for any day  equal to the higher of i pnc s published reference rate  ii the federal funds open rate in effect on such day plus one half of one percent or iii the daily libor rate in effect on such day plus one percent 
for eurodollar rate loans the interest rate per annum is equal to the sum of three and one half percent plus the greater of a the eurodollar rate  or b one percent 
the credit agreement requires monthly interest payments with respect to domestic rate loans and a payment at the end of each interest period with respect to eurodollar rate loans 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of the assets of presstek  inc and certain of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries that guaranty the obligations of presstek  inc  including all receivables  equipment  general intangibles  inventory  investment property  subsidiary stock  owned real property and leasehold interests of the company 
under the credit agreement the company is required to provide monthly borrowing base certificates to the agent that become the basis for calculating the credit agreement s formula amount 
the formula amount  capped at million  represents the maximum amount of advances available to the company at a given point in time 
the formula amount is normally calculated days subsequent to the close of each fiscal month 
because of the timing delay  the agent utilizes a process that estimates the maximum amount available daily during each fiscal period 
as of january  the formula amount was million and the company had outstanding balances on its line of credit of million 
the amount available under the credit line  based on the formula amount  was million as of january  the computed preliminary availability based on the daily estimation process was million as of that date 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is required to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and divestitures  with certain exceptions 
the key financial covenants include a requirement for the company to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter  commencing with the fiscal quarter ending january   a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to and a limit on capital expenditures for the company s first  second  third and fourth fiscal quarters in of    and  respectively  and  in each fiscal year thereafter 
as of january  the company was fully in compliance with all financial covenants 
the fixed charge ratio for the quarter ended january  was to  well in excess of the to minimum required ratio 
additionally  since the inception of the credit agreement  the company s quarterly capital expenditures have been well below the maximum levels allowed 
our liquidity is dependent on availability under our current credit agreement 
this availability is a function of both our cash generated by operations and our borrowing base availability primarily based on eligible inventories and accounts receivable and compliance with our debt covenants 
management believes there will be adequate availability and compliance with debt covenants throughout however  a significant decline in operating results could have a negative impact and may require management to scale back on capital expenditures and or other operating activities 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s short term borrowings was at january  contractual obligations our contractual obligations at january  consisted of the following in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years five or more years senior secured credit facilities purchase commitments operating leases total contractual obligations in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with fuji  whereby minimum royalty payments to fuji are required based on specified sales volumes of our a format size four color sheet fed di presses 
the agreement provides for total royalty payments to be no less than million and not greater than million over the life of the agreement 
as of january   the company had paid fuji million related to this agreement 
from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
generally  the company s liability for these recourse agreements is limited to of the amount outstanding 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at january   of which million relating to full recourse arrangements is reflected in deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet at january  effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards at january   we had us net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted directly from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from overall operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions result in reduction of current taxes payable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined by the internal revenue code 
an ownership change involves an increase of more than percentage points in stock ownership by one or more shareholders over a three year period 
at january   the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximated million at its uk subsidiary with an indefinite carryforward period and million at its canadian subsidiary which expire at various dates through critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of reported revenue and expenses during the period 
management believes the most judgmental estimates include those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and deferred tax assets  stock based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other appropriate factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue principally from the sale of products equipment  consumables  laser diodes and services equipment maintenance contracts  installation  training  support  and spare parts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition sab and fasb accounting standards codification topic multiple element arrangements originally issued as emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment and services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
product revenue end users under the company s standard terms and conditions of sale of equipment  title and risk of loss are transferred to end user customers upon completion of installation and revenue is recognized at that time  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant deliverables remain 
sales of other products  including printing plates  are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
oems product revenue and any related royalties for products sold to original equipment manufacturers oem are recognized at the time of shipment as installation is not required and title and risk of loss generally pass at shipment 
oem contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
distributors revenue for product sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment  unless other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
revenue for product sold to distributors under contracts which involve company installation of equipment is recognized upon installation  unless end user customer acceptance is uncertain  significant deliverables remain  or other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
except in cases of contract termination which may include limited product return rights  distributor contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product

revenue associated with maintenance or extended service agreements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with training and support services is recognized as services are rendered 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue is otherwise earned 
leases the company may offer customer financing to assist customers in the acquisition of presstek products 
at the time a financing transaction is consummated  which qualifies as a sales type lease  the company records equipment revenue equal to the net present value of future lease payments 
any remaining balance is recognized as finance income using the effective interest method over the term of the lease 
leases not qualifying as sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the company recognizes revenue from operating leases on an accrual basis as the rental payments become due 
multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and topic  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment  consumables or services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
rights of return a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once product is delivered to the customer  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
product revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
the company may invest in high quality money market instruments  securities of the us government  and high quality corporate issues 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales 
to reduce risk  we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and closely monitor their amounts due 
the company has a distributor that represented and of gross accounts receivable at january  and january   respectively 
a significant portion of this outstanding balance is collateralized to the company by drafts from the distributor s customers and our ability to take back and resell the distributor s on hand presstek equipment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of historical losses from uncollectible accounts and risks identified for specific customers who may not be able to make required payments 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represented and  respectively  of the company s gross accounts receivable balance at january  and january  the large increase in the reserve percentage in fiscal relates primarily to a single customer bad debt reserve of million established in the fourth quarter of fiscal inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated market value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory represented and  respectively  of the company s gross inventory value at january  and january  goodwill and intangible assets in order to complete the two step goodwill impairment tests as required by topic  the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
in accordance with the provisions of topic  the company designates reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment 
topic defines a reporting unit as the lowest level of an entity that is a business and that can be distinguished  physically and operationally and for internal reporting purposes  from the other activities  operations  and assets of the entity 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units of the company that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
based on the provisions of topic  the company has determined that it has one reporting unit in continuing operations for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s impairment review is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting units based on a discounted cash flow approach  and the market approach which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting unit based on comparable market multiples 
the average fair value is then reconciled to the company s market capitalization with an appropriate control premium 
the discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flows analysis in the quarter ended july  the last time this analysis was performed was approximately  reflecting market based estimates of capital costs and discount rates adjusted for a market participant s view with respect to execution  concentration  and other risks associated with the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units 
the peer companies used in the market approach are primarily the major competitors 
the company s valuation methodology requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance 
the company s policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test on the first business day of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  property plant and equipment originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time  the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with rights or intellectual property under these agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement and amortizes customer relationships over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
stock based compensation the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb accounting standards codification topic  stock compensation  originally adopted by the company in january   as sfas r share based payment  as amended sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
we recognize the fair value of stock compensation in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period  generally on a straight line basis for time vested awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of topic  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period 
further  we have elected under topic to recognize the fair value of awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
under topic  our stock based compensation is affected by our stock price as well as valuation assumptions  including the volatility of our stock price  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options 
we estimate volatility primarily using the historical volatility of presstek common stock over the expected term 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock based award 
accounting for income taxes the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
these differences and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
during fiscal  the company established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets on its balance sheet that represented nols and temporary differences from its uk  canadian and german operations 
during fiscal  the company established a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on its balance sheet that primarily represents nols from its us operations 
we continually assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may require the establishment or reduction of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in asc topic  business combinations 
the objective of asu is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity as defined by asc that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
this guidance will become effective for us for acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance modifies the fair value requirements of fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  by allowing the use of the best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of january   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
our borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and aluminum is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 
the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada  europe and asia and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
the company has not hedged the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
the company s primary foreign currency exchange risks relate to the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro  british pound and japanese yen would have an operating income impact of approximately million 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the us dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the us dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
