background we were incorporated in the state of nevada on november   under the name e 
deal 
net  inc  on june   we amended our articles of incorporation to effect a change of name to international energy  inc on june   we incorporated two wholly owned subsidiaries  international energy corp 
and e 
deal enterprises corp 
both subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada 
we are a development stage company previously engaged in an effort to develop processes and technologies permitting the commercially viable extraction of biofuels from algae 
on september   through our wholly owned subsidiary  international energy corp  we commenced the development and acquisition of biofuel technologies by entering into a research agreement with the regents of the university of california in the area of algal biochemistry and photosynthesis 
our research project aimed to develop protocols for the growth of microalgal cultures and for the generation of long chain liquid hydrocarbons 
these hydrocarbons are derived directly from the photosynthesis of the green microalgae 
we have reviewed research outcomes from the research agreement  which expired on september   and determined that it was not in our best interest to renew the research agreement 
we do not currently engage in any business operations 
we are  however  in the process of attempting to identify  locate  and if warranted  acquire new commercial opportunities 
we do not expect to generate any revenues for the foreseeable future and expect to continue incurring losses 
uoc research agreement on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  international energy corp  entered into a research agreement with the regents of the university of california 
the research agreement was for a period of two years  ending on september  we could negotiate with the regents of the university of california for a license at commercially reasonable royalty rates and license fees to commercialize the related products 
we had the right to apply for a patent on any invention made through the research

we utilize various third parties to manage our investor relations and facilitate our marketing programs  to increase company recognition and branding  and to provide shareholder communications 
the decrease in marketing and investor relations during the year ended march   compared to the prior year is substantially the result of  paid to an investor relations firm during the prior year pursuant to a one year market access services agreement  which expired on september  director and management fees non employee directors receive  per quarter for their services as directors

research and development expense for the year ended march  is comprised entirely of payments made pursuant to the research agreement 
professional fees professional fees substantially consist of accounting fees  audit and tax fees  legal fees  and sec related filing costs 
during the year ended march   we incurred professional fees of  a decrease of  from  during the prior year 
the decrease is substantially due to decreases in accounting related fees of approximately  legal fees of approximately  and sec related filing costs of approximately  the decrease in these costs from the prior year is the result of us filing amendments to our form s and a response to an sec comment letter in the prior year as well as an increase in the utilization of legal counsel during the prior year for the preparation and review of the required filings with the sec and related correspondence

other operating expenses other operating expenses include travel and entertainment  rent  telephone  office supplies  postage and printing  information technology related fees and other administrative costs 
during the year ended march   we incurred other operating expenses of  a decrease of  from  during the prior year 
the decrease is substantially due to a decrease in travel and entertainment related expense of approximately  and a decrease in rent of approximately  during the prior year  we were attempting to identify new commercial opportunities  which required significant travel 
the decrease in rent is partially due to the reduction of the size of the corporate office space that we leased in washington  dc 
effective august   rent for this facility was reduced from  per month to per month  plus variable charges 
offsetting the decrease in rent expense for the washington  dc office space is an increase in rent expense for the additional business office space we utilize in southfield  michigan  effective october  other income expense below is a summary of our other expense for the years ended march  and year ended march  change other income expense change in fair value of warrant liability foreign exchange loss total other income expense change in fair value of warrant liability on april   we adopted guidance which is now part of asc  contracts in entity s own equity asc 
we determined that our series b warrants contained a dilutive issuance provision see note capital stock and note warrants to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
as a result  we reclassified  of our series b warrants to warrant liability  resulting in a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit as of april  of our series b warrants were considered derivative liabilities and were therefore required to be adjusted to fair value each quarter 
we valued our warrant liability using a black scholes model 
our stock price  remaining term of the series b warrants and the volatility of our stock all impacted the fair value of our series b warrants 
at march   we determined that the fair value of the  outstanding series b warrants was  substantially due to the shortness of their remaining term 
all of the  series b warrants expired on april  accordingly  we did not record a non cash gain or loss during the year ended march  the adjustments recorded each quarter during the year ended march  to adjust the series b warrants to fair value resulted in a non cash gain of  during the year ended march  liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
we have an accumulated deficit of  through march  and do not have positive cash flows from operating activities 
due to the start up nature of our business  we expect to incur losses as we continue development of our technologies and expand 
we face all the risks common to development stage companies  including under capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources  high initial expenditure levels  uncertain revenue streams  and difficulties in managing growth 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management recognizes that in order to meet our capital requirements  and continue to operate  additional financing will be necessary 
we expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investments in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations 
we will seek access to private or public equity but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow  it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
our principal source of liquidity is cash in the bank 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we have financed our operations primarily from funds received pursuant to a private placement completed in april  raising gross proceeds of  and cash received from the exercise of warrants 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended march   compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the prior year 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities of  was substantially due to decreases in amounts paid for marketing and investor relations  research and development  professional fees  salaries and benefits  and rent 
please refer to results of operations above for discussion regarding the decreases in these expenses 
other contractual obligations as of march   our contractual obligations consist of future minimum lease payments of  pursuant to our corporate office lease in washington  dc and our business office lease in southfield  michigan 
in addition  we have future minimum payments of pursuant to an agreement with a third party for investor and shareholder relations services 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards as issued 
although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable to us  we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion 
we believe that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements
