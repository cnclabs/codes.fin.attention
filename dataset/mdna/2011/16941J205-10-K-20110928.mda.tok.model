introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of china precision steel  inc and our subsidiaries together  the group financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion is organized as follows 
overview of the company s business this section provides a general description of the group s business  as well as recent developments that have either occurred during the fiscal year ended june  and are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition or disclose known trends 
results of operations this section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  this discussion includes a brief description of significant transactions and events that have an impact on the comparability of the results being analyzed 
liquidity and capital resources this section provides an analysis of the group s cash flows for the fiscal year ended june  included in this section is a discussion of the group s outstanding debt and the financial capacity available to fund the group s future commitments and obligations 
overview of the company s business we are a niche and high value added steel processing company principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of high precision cold rolled steel products  in the provision of heat treatment and in the cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips 
we use commodity steel to create a high value added specialty premium steel 
specialty precision steel pertains to the precision of measurements and tolerances of thickness  shape  width  surface finish and other special quality features of highly engineered end use applications 
we produce and sell precision ultra thin and high strength cold rolled steel products ranging from mm to mm 
we also provide heat treatment and cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips not exceeding mm thickness 
our process puts hot rolled de scaled pickled steel coils through a cold rolling mill  utilizing our patented systems and high technology reduction processing procedures  to make steel coils and sheets in customized thicknesses according to customer specifications 
currently  our specialty precision products are mainly used in the manufacture of automobile parts and components  steel roofing  plane friction discs  appliances  food packaging materials  saw blades  textile needles  and microelectronics 
we conduct our operations principally in china through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  chengtong and shanghai blessford  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of our direct subsidiary  pshl 
most of our sales are made domestically in china  however  we began exporting during fiscal and our overseas market currently covers indonesia  thailand  the caribbean  nigeria and ethiopia 
we intend to further expand into additional overseas markets in the future  subject to suitable market conditions and favorable regulatory controls 
recent developments on september   we received notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market  llc indicating that  for the last consecutive business days  the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share required for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market nasdaq under nasdaq listing rule a 
the notification letter stated that we would be provided calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
in order to regain compliance  shares of our common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
we intend to actively monitor the bid price for our common stock through march   and will consider all available options  including a reverse stock split  to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid price requirements 
fiscal financial performance highlights during the year ended june   we saw continued growth in demand for our cold rolled steel products together with fast rising costs 
domestic consumption continued to increase under china th five year economic development plan which boosted demand  however  high inflation and especially high raw material costs have substantially and adversely impacted our gross margin compared to the prior fiscal year 
during the year ended june   we sold a total of  tons of products  an increase of  tons from  tons a year ago  due to an increase in demand in the domestic market as well as the addition of our rd mill which will increase our total annual production capacity ultimately to  tons when it reaches its full design capacity in the next two to three years 
such increase was mainly driven by increases in demand from the home appliance products  roofing materials  food packaging  and automobile components markets in connection with growing domestic consumer spending during the year ended june  however  despite the growing consumption and the year on year sales volume growth  average cost per unit sold increased while average selling prices increased only year on year 
we were not able to fully pass on the increased cost onto our customers as we mainly compete with imported materials and the strengthening of rmb over the recent years have made the imports more competitive 
increased volume and sales coupled with rising costs have led to a gross profit of  and a small net income of  for the year ended june  total company backlog as of june  amounted to  to combat high inflation and rising costs in china and to increase overall profitability  we are actively working on expanding our customer base to increase total demand which reduces per unit cost  optimizing our product mix by carrying out research and development r d to improve profitability of existing products and launch new high value add products  and prioritizing higher margin products among existing customers and markets 
we will also continue to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of customers and suppliers and strengthen collection of accounts receivable with the goal to maintain overall healthy sales volume  margins and cash positions 
we believe that high barriers to entry in the chinese domestic precision cold rolled steel industry still exist because of the level of technological expertise and the amount of capital required for operation 
although we expect a continuation of volatility in demand in both domestic and international markets  and a difficult operating environment due to high inflation and rising costs which could have adverse impacts on our gross margins in the near future  the medium to long term prospects of our niche remain optimistic 
we believe that our unique capabilities and know how give us a competitive advantage to grow sales and build a globally recognized brand as we continue to carry out r d and expand to new segments  customers and markets 
the following are some financial highlights for the year revenues our revenues were approximately million for the year  an increase of from last year

sales by product line a break down of our sales by product line for the years ended june  and is as follows year on product category quantity tons amount of sales quantity tons amount of sales year qty 
variance low carbon hard rolled low carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high carbon cold rolled subcontracting income sales of scrap metal total there were different trends of demand across various product categories during the year ended june  low carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  the increase in demand in this category during the year was a result of increased orders of steel used in the production of home appliances  steel roofing and food packaging materials as a result of growing domestic consumer spending 
low carbon hard rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june   due to a decrease in demand in the export market year on year as a result of our less competitive prices in the global market caused by the strengthening of the renminbi against the us dollar during the year 
high carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the current sales mix at an average selling price of  for the year ended june  the products in this category are mainly used in the automobile industry and the increase in sales volume year on year was a result of the continually growing demand for automobiles in the prc market 
subcontracting income revenues accounted for  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june   decreased from  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june  variance average selling prices low carbon hard rolled low carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high carbon cold rolled subcontracting income the average selling price per ton increased to for the year ended june   compared to in  representing an increase of  or  year on year 
this increase was mainly due to increases in general steel prices and therefore our selling prices during the year 
there were increases in average selling prices across all product categories except high carbon cold rolled products and subcontracting work during the year ended june  sales breakdown by major customer customers of sales of sales shanghai shengdejia metal co  ltd shanghai changshuo steel co  ltd

the change in customer mix reflects management s continuous efforts in expanding our customer base and geographical coverage during the course of the year 
cost of goods sold cost of sales increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  cost of sales represented of sales revenues for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  average cost per unit sold increased to for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june   representing an increase of per ton  or  year on year 
variance cost of goods sold raw materials direct labor manufacturing overhead cost per unit sold total units sold tons average cost per unit sold ton the increase in average per unit cost of sales is represented by the combined effect of an increase in cost of raw materials per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june   a decrease in direct labor per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june   a decrease in factory overhead per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  the cost of raw materials consumed increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase was due to increases in total units sold and average raw material cost per unit sold 
direct labor costs decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  manufacturing overhead costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in depreciation charged to manufacturing overhead of  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  and an increase in utilities of  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the substantially increased units sold  year on year  have led to a decrease in average direct labor and manufacturing overhead cost per unit sold of and  respectively  due to economies of scale 
gross profit gross profit in absolute terms decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   and gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit margin is mainly attributable to an increase in average cost per unit sold of year on year offset by a year on year increase in average selling prices 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  in the decrease was mainly attributable to less selling commission costs associated with largely reduced export sales year on year 
administrative expenses administrative expenses decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  this was chiefly due to an exchange gain recognized in the amount of  on our usd long term loan as a result of rmb appreciation against usd during the year ended june   offset by an increase in insurance expenses in the amount of  or  year on year  due to coverage of additional property  plant and equipment at our operating subsidiaries and increased premiums during the year ended june  allowance for bad and doubtful debts allowance for bad and doubtful debts decreased by  or  year on year 
allowance recognized for the year ended june  was in the amount of  in accordance with our policy for allowance for bad and doubtful debts set forth under the critical accounting policies and estimates heading in this report 
income from operations income from operations decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income other income decreased  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  other income decreased to less than for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  such decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances year on year 
interest expense total interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  due to increases in loan balances and interest rates year on year 
income tax for the year ended june   we recognized an income tax expense of  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase of  or  in income tax expense year on year against lower net income reported for the year ended june  was a result of the carried forward tax losses deduction which reduced the income tax expenses for the prior year  as well as an increased enterprise income tax rate for shanghai blessford starting january  net income net income decreased by  or  year on year  to net income of  for the year ended june  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the decrease in net income is attributable to a combination of all the factors discussed above  including increase in the average cost per unit sold and decrease in gross margin 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity financing  and bank debt 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this report cash flow year ended june  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash flows operating activities net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the year ended june   for a net increase of  this increase was mainly due to increase in cash outflow for advances to suppliers of  due to expanded volume and production  increase in cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and offset by decrease in cash outflow from inventories of  and increase in cash inflow from accounts receivable of  during the year ended june  the cash outflow for advances to suppliers was to secure raw materials at the cost at time of payment in view of further rising costs announced by the major suppliers in the market  and in line with our increased production during the year ended june  for the year ended june   sales revenues generated from the top five major customers as a percentage of total sales stood at  same as the prior year 
the loss of all or portion of the sales volume from a significant customer would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the worldwide economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us  resulting in unrecoverable losses on our accounts receivable 
we have been strengthening our collection activities and will continue to closely monitor any changes in collection experience and the credit ratings of our customers 
from time to time we will review credit periods offered  along with our collection experience and the other relevant factors  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
delays or non payment of accounts receivable would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities during the year ended june  were for the purchase of property  plant and equipment related to the addition of annealing furnaces at our shanghai blessford facilities 
we believe this capital investment increases our capacity  expands product lines  improves product qualities and creates synergies with our existing production facilities  thereby creating opportunities to grow sales  enter new markets and further strengthen our leading position in the niche cold rolling segment that we operate in 
net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the year ended june  cash flows used in investing activities increased as we made payments for the construction of the additional annealing furnaces towards its completion during the year 
we forecast lower capital expenditures in the coming years as the company has already completed most of its major expansion plans and all the construction costs relating to our third cold rolling mill have been paid for as at june  financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended june  were  as compared to those provided by financing activities for the year ended june  of  for a net decrease of  during the year ended june   the company made repayment of short term loans in the amount of  and received no additional loan proceeds 
on december   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec  which was declared effective on december  the shelf registration will permit us to issue securities valued at up to an aggregate of million 
now that the registration statement is effective  we will have the flexibility to issue registered securities  from time to time  in one or more separate offerings or other transactions with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
although we do not have any commitments or current intentions to sell securities under the registration statement  we believe that it is prudent to have a shelf registration statement in place to ensure financing flexibility should the need arise 
our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities will vary from quarter to quarter  and are dependent on factors such as volume of business and payment terms with our customers 
as such  we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity 
however  the current uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions  including the continuing disruption in credit markets  poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing 
the general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
even if we are able to obtain credit  the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations 
our inability to renew our current bank debt that is due in july  and the unavailability of additional debt financing as a result of economic pressures on the credit and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
current assets current assets increased by  or  year on year  to  as of june   from  as of june   principally as a result of an increase in advances to suppliers of  or  year on year  offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  or  year on year  a decrease in bills receivable of  or  year on year  and a decrease in inventories of  or  year on year 
accounts receivable  representing of total current assets as of june   is a significant asset of the company 
we offer credit to our customers in the normal course of our business and accounts receivable is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to the end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as the credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer longer credit terms to long standing recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
from time to time we review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
our management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining at least quarterly communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
in making this determination  our management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  for the year ended june   our management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
the following table reflects the aging of our accounts receivable based on due date as of june  and june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total management continues to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of any prospective customers whether new or returning to protect the company from any who might pose a high credit risk to our business based on their commercial credit reports  our past collection history with them  and our perception of the risk posed by their geographic location 
for example  we have halted since the year ended june  all our sales transactions directly with customers in the philippines as we consider the associated credit risk to be relatively high 
based on publicly available reports  such as that issued by am best  there is a high risk that financial volatility may erupt in that country due to inadequate reporting standards  a weak banking system or asset markets and or poor regulatory structure 
we expect to resume such exports when conditions improve 
management is also of the opinion that we do not currently have any high risk receivables on our accounts 
current liabilities current liabilities increased by  or  year on year  to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in other taxes payable of  or  year on year  and an increase in the current portion of long term loan of  or  year on year  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  or  year on year 
as of june   we had  in short term loans 
these short term loans have been renewed in july for one year and will be due on july  we expect to refinance such debt at its maturity  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to the company or at all 
capital expenditures during the year ended june   we invested  in purchases of property  plant and equipment  and construction projects in relation to the new annealing furnaces 
loan facilities the following table illustrates our credit facilities as of june   providing the name of the lender  the amount of the facility  the date of issuance and the maturity date all amounts in us dollars lender date of loan maturity date duration interest rate principal amount raiffeisen times of zentralbank sterreich july  july  year ag rzb the pboc rate rmb  raiffeisen july  july  year times of the zentralbank sterreich ag pboc rate rmb china merchant bank january  july  months rmb  deg deutsche month usd investitions und june  june  years entwicklungsgesellschaft mbh libor rmb  total as of june   we had  in short term loans secured by inventories  land use rights  buildings  plant and machinery   in short term loans secured by bills receivable  and  in long term loan  including current portion  secured by plant and machinery  as illustrated in the above table 
the short term loans with rzb have been renewed for one year in july and will be due and renewable on july  we are not aware of any existing issues that may lead to a withdrawal of such loan at its maturity 
our inability to renew  and the unavailability of additional debt financing as a result of economic pressures on the credit and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
we believe that our currently available working capital and the credit facilities referred to above should be adequate to sustain our operations at our current levels and support our contractual commitments through the next twelve months 
however  our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers 
as we expect a continuation of volatility in demand and steel prices in both domestic and international markets in the foreseeable future  our operating cash flows might be significantly negatively impacted by reduced sales and margins 
management has strengthened its sales and marketing activities  and continues to be in talks with potential customers whose past orders we had been unable to fill due to full capacity  which if successful  could result in additional sales and mitigate the impact of the weakened demand and margins on our operating cash flow 
as of june   the company also had  in debt obligation for interest relating to its short term and long term loans 
as such  we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity 
however  continued uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions  including the continuing disruption in credit markets  poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing 
the general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
even if we are able to obtain credit  the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that could restrict our present and future operations 
obligations under material contracts below is a table setting forth our material contractual obligations as of june   debt obligations include principal repayments and interest payments payments due by year total fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal years and beyond contractual obligations short term debt obligations current portion of long term debt obligations long term debt obligations recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires reporting entities to provide information about movements of assets among levels and of the three tier fair value hierarchy established by asc the guidance is effective for any fiscal year that begins after december  and should be used for quarterly and annual filings 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of adopting the amendments in asu and cannot estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
this update amends asc topic  fair value measurement and disclosure 
asu clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning january  the new guidance is to be adopted prospectively and early adoption is not permitted 
we do not believe that adoption of asu will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after december   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning july  retrospective adoption is required and early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe that adoption of asu will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following functional currency and translating financial statements the company s principal country of operations is the prc 
our functional currency is chinese renminbi  however  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in usd 
the consolidated balance sheets have been translated into usd at the exchange rates prevailing at each balance sheet date 
the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been translated using the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the periods of each statement 
the registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution 
all translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements into the reporting currency are dealt with as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership  which generally coincides with the time when the goods are delivered to customers and the title has passed and services have been rendered 
revenue is reported net of all vat taxes 
other income is recognized when it is earned 
accounts receivable credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer longer credit terms to long standing recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
accounts receivable is recorded at the time revenue is recognized and is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of the accounts receivable 
management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining regular communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
however  we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
at june   approximately of our accounts receivable were past due over days 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  for the year ended june   our management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
at june  and  the company had  and  of allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
bad debts are written off for past due balances over two years or when it becomes known to management that such amount is uncollectible 
provision for bad debts recognized for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
the current year charge reflects a provision for doubtful accounts based on our policy described above 
our management is continually working to ensure that any known uncollectible amounts are immediately written off as bad debt against outstanding balances 
advances to suppliers in order to insure a steady supply of raw materials  the company is required from time to time to make cash advances to its suppliers when placing purchase orders  for a guaranteed minimum delivery quantity at future times when raw materials are required 
the advance is seen as a deposit to suppliers and guarantees our access to raw materials during periods of shortages and market volatility  and is therefore considered an important component of our operations 
contracted raw materials are priced at prevailing market rates agreed by us with the suppliers prior to each delivery date 
advances to suppliers are shown net of an allowance which represents potentially unrecoverable cash advances at each balance sheet date 
such allowances are based on an analysis of past raw materials receipt experience and the credibility of each supplier according to its size and background 
in general  we do not provide allowances against advances paid to state owned companies as there is minimal risk of default 
our allowances for advances to suppliers are subjective critical estimates that have a direct impact on reported net earnings  and are reviewed quarterly at a minimum to reflect changes from our historic raw material receipt experience and to ensure the appropriateness of the allowance in light of the circumstances present at the time of the review 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the allowance will change  such as in the case when the company becomes aware of a supplier s inability to deliver the contracted raw materials or meet its financial obligations 
as of june  and  the company had allowances of advances to suppliers of  and  respectively 
the majority of our advances to suppliers of over days is attributable to our advances to a subsidiary of a state owned company in china  whose risk of default is minimal 
at june   this supplier has confirmed to our management that it is committed to delivering the contracted raw materials as and when those are needed by the company 
allowances for advances to suppliers are written off when all efforts to collect the materials or recover the cash advances have been unsuccessful  or when it has become known to the management that there is no intention for the suppliers to deliver the contracted raw materials or refund the cash advances 
to date  we have not written off any advances to suppliers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
market value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to complete the sale 
intangible assets intangible assets represent land use rights in china acquired by the company and are stated at cost less amortization 
amortization of land use rights is calculated on the straight line method  based on the period over which the right is granted by the relevant authorities in china 
the company acquired land use rights in august and december that both expire in december the land use rights are amortized over a fifty year term 
intangible assets of the company are reviewed for impairment if there are triggering events  to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired  in conformity with asc the company also re evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
an impairment test was performed as of june  and no impairment charges were recognized for the relevant periods 
as of june   the company expects these assets to be fully recoverable 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its present working condition and location for its intended use 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment are as follows buildings years plant and machinery years motor vehicles years office equipment years repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations in the year in which they are incurred 
in situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset  the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset 
the company accounts for impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with asc  which requires the company to evaluate a long lived asset for recoverability when there is an event or circumstance that indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we determine such impairment by measuring the estimated undiscounted future cash flow generated by the assets  comparing the result to the asset carrying value and adjusting the asset to the lower of its carrying value or fair value and charging current operations for the measured impairment 
as of june   the company s market capitalization was significantly lower than its total stockholders equity 
management considered this to be an indicator of impairment  and accordingly  performed an impairment test  using a normal and a worse case scenario  and assessed fair value based on average tons sold  selling price per ton  gross margin  and other cash inflows and outflows for the next ten years where our mills are expected to remain in operation 
no impairment charges were recognized for the current year 
assumptions and estimates used in our impairment test provide the general direction of major factors expected to affect our business and cash flows  and are subject to risks and uncertainties such as changes in interest rates  industry cyclicality  and factors surrounding the general chinese and global economies 
those estimates will be reassessed for their reasonableness at each impairment test 
other policies other accounting policies used by the company are set forth in the notes accompanying our financial statements 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows historically have been subject to seasonal variations 
our revenues are usually higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year and the first quarter is usually the slowest quarter because fewer projects are undertaken during and around the chinese new year holidays 
off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements
