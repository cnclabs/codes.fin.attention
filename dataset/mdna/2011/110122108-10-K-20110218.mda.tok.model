item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary business environment  the patient protection and affordable care act hr and a reconciliation bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill were signed into law during march these bills included provisions that increased the medicaid rebate  expanded the medicaid program  provided additional prescription drug discounts to certain patients under medicare part d and assesses a new  non tax deductible annual fee to pharmaceutical companies  among other things 
we have experienced and will continue to experience significant financial costs and certain other changes to our business as the new healthcare law is implemented 
in  higher rebates to medicaid and medicaid managed care plans reduced our net sales by million and pre tax income by million 
on an incremental year over year basis  we expect us healthcare reform to have a negative impact on earnings per share in of approximately 
this estimate includes an expected reduction of net sales of approximately million due to new discounts associated with the medicare part d donut hole coverage gap and an increase in marketing  sales and administrative expenses of approximately million due to the new annual non tax deductible pharmaceutical company fee 
the laws also created a regulatory mechanism that allows for approval of biologic drugs that are similar to but not generic copies of innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is the basis for a full bla 
us and foreign laws and regulations may negatively affect our net sales and profit margins 
we could become subject to new government laws and regulations  such as i additional healthcare reform initiatives in the us at the federal and state level and in other countries  including additional mandatory discounts  ii changes in the us fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may cause delays in approving  or preventing the approval of  new products  iii tax changes such as the phasing out of tax benefits heretofore available in the us and in certain foreign countries or other changes in tax law such as the recent amendment to the puerto rico internal revenue code of imposing an excise tax on certain transactions  which could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations  iv new laws  regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing  reimbursement or marketing within or across jurisdictions  v changes in intellectual property law  and vi other matters  such as compulsory licenses that could alter the protections afforded to one or more of our products 
any legal or regulatory changes could negatively affect our business  and or our operating results and the financial condition of our company 
changes to the product labeling for any of our marketed products or results from certain studies released after a product is approved could potentially have a negative impact on sales of that product 
the labeling for any pharmaceutical product can be changed by the regulatory authorities at any time  including after the product has been on the market for years 
these changes are often the result of additional data from post marketing studies  head to head trials  spontaneous reporting of adverse events from patients or healthcare professionals  studies that identify biomarkers objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy  or other studies that produce important additional information about a product 
the new information added to a product s labeling can affect the safety risk and or the efficacy benefit profile of the product 
sometimes the additional information from these studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may be non responsive to the medicine 
changes to a labeling based on such studies may limit the patient population  such as the recent changes to the labeling for plavix and erbitux 
the studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us  but they can also be sponsored by our competitors  insurance companies  government institutions  managed care organizations  influential scientists or investigators  or other interested parties 
while additional safety and efficacy information from these studies assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each of our products  it can also have a negative impact on sales for any such product to the extent that the patient population or product labeling becomes more limited 
additionally  certain study results  especially from head to head trials  could affect a product s formulary listing  which could also have an adverse effect on sales 

table of contents we may experience difficulties and delays in the manufacturing  distribution and sale of our products 
we may experience difficulties and delays inherent in the manufacturing  distribution and sale of our products  such as i seizure or recalls of products or forced closings of manufacturing plants  ii supply chain continuity including as a result of a natural or man made disaster at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor as well as our failure or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers to comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns  product shortages and delays in product manufacturing  iii manufacturing  quality assurance quality control  supply problems or governmental approval delays due to our consolidation and rationalization of manufacturing facilities and the sale or closure of certain sites  iv the failure of a sole source or single source supplier to provide us with necessary raw materials  supplies or finished goods for an extended period of time that could impact continuous supply  v the failure of a third party manufacturer to supply us with finished product on a timely bases  vi construction or regulatory approval delays related to new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities  including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products  and vii other manufacturing or distribution problems including limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements  changes in types of products produced  such as biologics  physical limitations or other business interruptions that could impact continuous supply 
in  we received a warning letter from the fda regarding our manufacturing facility in manati  puerto rico 
the warning letter focused on certain gmp processes and practices  which the fda identified during an inspection  that were to be improved or remediated 
we have provided a response to the warning letter and have informed the fda that the manati facility is inspection ready 
if we are unable to timely and adequately improve or remediate the gmp issues identified to the fda s satisfaction  we could be subject to additional inspectional observations by the fda requiring remediation 
if any of these observations are serious  we could face additional negative consequences including a temporary delay in production at the facility for further corrective action or delay in approval of filings 
in january  we and our partner sanofi voluntarily recalled certain lots of avalide from the us  puerto rican  canadian  mexican and argentinean markets 
we are working with our partner sanofi to identify all possible solutions to this issue  including process adjustments and alternate supply sources 
if we are unable to resupply to these markets in a timely manner  this may have a negative impact on our net sales  cash flows and earnings 
the resolution of the manufacturing and supply issues discussed in this form k  as well as the potential impact of those issues on our revenues and earnings  are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include the timing  scope and duration for resolving the manufacturing and supply issues 
we may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products 
we may experience difficulties and delays in the development and commercialization of new products  including the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with product development  such as i compounds or products that may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe  or fail ever to reach market  or to be approved for product extensions or additional indications for any number of reasons  including efficacy or safety concerns  the delay or denial of necessary regulatory approvals  delays or difficulties with producing products at a commercial scale level or excessive costs to manufacture products  ii failure to enter into or successfully implement optimal alliances where appropriate for the discovery and or commercialization of products  iii failure to maintain a consistent scope and variety of promising late stage products  or iv failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain commercial viability 
in addition  in the us  we have observed a recent trend by the fda to delay its approval decision on a new product beyond its announced action date  sometimes by as much as six months or longer 
regulatory approval delays are especially common when the product is expected to have risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to address significant risk benefit issues 
the inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in process research and development or other intangible assets 
finally  a natural or man made disaster or sabotage of research and development labs and a loss of key molecules and intermediaries could negatively impact the product development cycle 
there are legal matters in which adverse outcomes could negatively affect our business 
we are currently involved in or could in the future become involved in various lawsuits  claims  proceedings and government investigations  any of which can preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect operations  profitability  liquidity or financial condition after any possible insurance recoveries where available 
such legal matters include i intellectual property disputes  ii sales and marketing practices in the us and internationally  iii adverse decisions in litigation  including product liability and commercial cases  iv recalls or withdrawals of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants  v the failure to fulfill obligations under supply contracts with the government and other customers which may result in liability  vi product pricing and promotional matters  vii lawsuits and claims asserting violations of securities  antitrust  federal and state pricing  antibribery such as the foreign corrupt practice act and other laws  viii environmental  health and safety matters  and ix tax liabilities 
there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in scope in any or all of these matters or there will not be additional lawsuits  claims  proceedings or investigations in the future  nor is there any assurance that any or all of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents we rely on third parties to meet their contractual  regulatory  and other obligations 
we rely on suppliers  vendors and partners  including alliances with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacturing  development and commercialization of products  and other third parties to meet their contractual  regulatory  and other obligations in relation to their arrangements with us 
the failure of these parties to meet their obligations  and or the development of significant disagreements or other factors that materially disrupt the ongoing commercial relationship and prevent optimal alignment between the partners and their activities  could have a material adverse impact on us 
in addition  if these parties violate or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations for us  it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes  including possible legal consequences 
we are increasingly dependent on our outsourcing arrangements 
we are increasing our dependence on third party providers for certain outsourced services  including certain research and development capabilities  certain financial outsourcing arrangements  certain human resource functions  and information technology activities and systems 
many of these third party providers are located in markets that are subject to political risk  corruption  infrastructure problems and natural disasters in addition to country specific privacy and data security risks given current legal and regulatory environments 
the failure of these service providers to meet their obligations  adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis and or the development of significant disagreements  natural or man made disasters or other factors that materially disrupt our ongoing relationship with these providers could negatively affect operations 
failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
over the last few years  we have transformed from a diversified pharmaceutical and related healthcare products company into a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on innovative products in areas of high unmet medical need 
with the expected loss of exclusivity in the us for our largest product  plavix  in may  after which time we expect a rapid  precipitous  material decline in plavix net sales and a reduction in net income and operating cash flow  we are focused on building a foundation for the future 
we plan to achieve this foundation by continuing to support and grow our currently marketed products  advancing our late stage pipeline  managing our costs  and maintaining and improving our financial strength with a strong balance sheet 
there are risks associated with this strategy 
we may not be able to consistently replenish our innovative pipeline  through internal research and development or transactions with third parties 
the competition among major pharmaceutical companies for acquisition and product licensing opportunities has become more intense  eliminating some opportunities and making others more expensive 
we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition targets or licensing partners at reasonable prices or successfully execute such transactions 
additionally  changes in our structure  operations  revenues  costs  or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions  divestitures  mergers  alliances  restructurings or other strategic initiatives  may result in greater than expected costs  may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties  including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 
the inability to expand our product portfolio with new products or maintain a competitive cost basis could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations 
if we are unable to support and grow our currently marketed products  advance our late stage pipeline and manage our costs effectively  we could experience a significant or material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our failure to hire and retain personnel with the right expertise and experience in operations that are critical to our business functions could adversely impact the execution of our business strategy 
we are increasingly dependent on information technology and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 
we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and any significant breakdown  invasion  destruction or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations 
in addition  there is a risk of business interruption or reputational damage from an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information both internally and at our third party providers 
the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection of personal information 
negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation 
in addition  the disclosure of non public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and achieve this information 
identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges 
adverse changes in us  global  or regional economic conditions could have a continuing adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses 
high government debt burdens and continued high unemployment rates  rising prices  including those related to commodities and energy  and lower economic growth has adversely affected commercial activity in the us  europe and other regions of the world in which we do business 
further government austerity measures or declines in economic activity in markets in which we do business could adversely affect demand and pricing for our products  thus reducing our revenues  earnings and cash flow  as well as have pass through effects on us resulting from any significant financial instability from our customers  distributors  alliance partners  suppliers  critical vendors  service providers and counterparties to certain financial instruments  such as marketable securities and derivatives 
future pension plan funding requirements continue to be sensitive to global economic conditions and related impact on equity markets 

table of contents changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have significant operations outside of the us revenues from operations outside of the us accounted for of our revenues in as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we also have significant borrowings which are exposed to changes in interest rates 
we are also exposed to other economic factors over which we have no control 
the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 
third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products  which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo 
a patient who receives a counterfeit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences 
our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under the name of one of our products 
in addition  thefts of inventory at warehouses  plants or while in transit which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety  our reputation and our business
