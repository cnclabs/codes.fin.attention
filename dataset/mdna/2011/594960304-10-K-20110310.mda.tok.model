item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing high resolution miniature laser display and imaging engines based upon our proprietary picop display engine technology 
our picop technology utilizes our widely patented expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
our strategy is to develop and supply picop display engines to original equipment manufacturers oems that would embed them into a variety of consumer  automotive  enterprise and industrial products 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile consumer devices such as smartphones  media players  tablet pcs and other consumer electronics products with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small embedded projector 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies and videos  play video games  and display images and other data onto a variety of surfaces  freeing users from the limitations of a small  palm sized screen 
the picop could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
the picop with some modification could be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a high resolution head up display hud that could project point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the vehicle operator 
the enterprise products employing our technology would allow users in field based professions such as service repair or sales to view and share information such as schematics for equipment repair and sales data and orders within crm applications on a larger  more user friendly interface 
we also see potential for embedding the picop laser display engine in industrial products where our displays could be used for d measuring and digital signage  enhancing the overall user experience of these applications 
in  we launched the first commercial product based on the picop display engine  a small accessory pico projector called the showwx laser pico projector  through our asian and european based distributors and have subsequently added additional sales channels and a second accessory product 
we currently market and sell our accessory projectors through a network of global distributors as well as directly to end users through our website 
in the future  we plan to add distribution channels and geographic locations for our picop based products 
we continue to enter into a limited number of development agreements with commercial and us government customers to develop advanced prototypes and demonstration units based on our light scanning technologies 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ending december  we anticipate lowering our cash used in operations in significantly  through a combination of sharing development  product design  and commercialization costs with development partners  investing in advancement of next generation picop technology based on direct green lasers while limiting our investment in the current generation picop technology based on synthetic green lasers  lowering our working capital requirements and reducing our operating costs through other measures including a workforce reduction completed in january key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenue and contract revenue on the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits  when there is sufficient evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we have entered into agreements with resellers and distributors  as well as selling directly to the public 
sales made to resellers and distributors are recognized using either the sell through method or upon expiration of the contractually agreed upon acceptance period  depending on the volume of the sale 
some of the agreements with resellers and distributors contain price protection clauses  and revenue is recognized net of these amounts 
sales made directly to the public are recognized either upon expiration of the contractual acceptance period after which there are no rights of return  or net of estimated returns and allowances 
provisions are made for warranties at the time revenue is recorded 
warranty expense was not material for any periods presented 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee  and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we have developed processes that allow us to make reasonable estimates of the cost to complete a contract 
when we begin work on the contract and at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the labor  material and other costs required to complete the contract using information provided by our technical team  project managers  vendors  outside consultants and others and compare these to costs incurred to date 
since our contracts generally require some level of technology development to complete  the actual cost required to complete a contract can vary from our estimates 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as actual cost becomes certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  we have made only immaterial revisions in the estimates to complete the contract at each reporting period 
in the future  revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units  evaluation kits  showwx and rov units 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units  evaluation kits  and accessory pico projector products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our manufacturing and technical capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  and facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if the estimated cost to complete a contract exceeds the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer and related party past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist entirely of purchased patents 
the patents are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from one to years 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a net realizable value basis 
we make significant judgments and estimates to value our inventory and make adjustments to its carrying value 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials  the net realizable value of the finished goods  and the likelihood of obsolescence 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock and restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock 
we account for equity instruments issued to employees using the straight line attribution method of allocating the fair value of share based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award 
the value of restricted or unrestricted shares is determined using the fair value method  which is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
the value of options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model with estimates of option lives  stock price volatilities and interest rates  then expensed over the periods of service allowing for pre vest forfeitures 
this widely accepted method results in reasonable option values and interperiod expense allocation  and comparability across companies 
changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods could result in materially different option values and share based compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands bar code revenue pico projector revenue  total product revenue   bar code revenue includes the sales of rov bar code scanners 
the decrease in bar code revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to our decreased investment in our bar code product during we do not expect to increase our investment in the bar code product in the future and we are currently evaluating opportunities to sell our existing bar code inventory and sell or license our bar code production capability and technology 
pico projector revenue includes the sales of showwx which was launched in september and the showwx which was launched in november our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately million  compared to million at december  product backlog at december  includes orders for million from an oem customer for embedded display engines 
the customer plans to embed the engines into its high end media player and has communicated plans to launch its product during the second quarter of we are working with the customer to define specific product launch timing and initial forecast for delivery of the embedded engines 
the remaining product backlog is scheduled for delivery within one year 
contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue  commercial revenue  total contract revenue  we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the us government and commercial customers and from the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits based on our picop display engine 
our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
our contract revenue from sales of prototype units and evaluation kits may vary substantially due to the timing of orders from customers and potential constraints on resources 
contract revenue from government and commercial contracts was substantially lower during than in due to reduced contract activity and lower beginning backlog in compared to the previous year 
we expect that we will enter into few new development contracts for engineering services as we continue to focus our resources on commercialization of products based on the picop display engine 
our backlog of development contracts  including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits  at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts at december  the increase in backlog from is primarily attributed to two contracts with the us government entered into in late we plan to complete the entire contract backlog by mid cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   cost of product revenue includes the direct and allocated indirect cost of manufacturing products sold to customers 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of these products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
our costs to produce accessory pico projector units during were substantially higher than product revenue 
during the early phase of showwx production  our design and manufacturing processes were not sufficiently mature to support commercial production 
we classified overhead cost allocated to the showwx as research and development expense until february  when we determined that the showwx design and production processes were mature enough to reach a level to support commercial production and since february  all manufacturing costs have been included in cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue for and  included a write down of million and million  respectively  for inventory in stock at the end of the year 
the write downs included lower of cost or market adjustments primarily comprised of adjustments to our inventory value to reflect the then current estimated selling price for our inventory  as well as a reserve adjustment for materials which we expect would become obsolete as we introduced new products 
the increase in cost of product revenue for  compared to  was primarily attributed to increased material costs associated with higher volumes of product shipments and increased inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
the increase in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in compared to the same period in was due to an increase in inventory write downs and a higher cost structure for the showwx product 
cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units and evaluation kits 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units and evaluation kits 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
cost of contract revenue is determined both by the level of direct costs incurred and by the level of indirect costs incurred in operating and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
both the direct and indirect costs can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
the cost of contract revenue was lower in than in as a result of the decreased activity on development contracts as we continue to focus our resources on commercialization of products based on the picop display engine 
the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was lower in than in as a result of difference in the cost mix of the contracts during those periods 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
however  over longer periods of time we expect modest fluctuations in the cost of contract revenue  as a percentage of contract revenue 
research and development expense 
change change in thousands research and development    research and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  direct material to support development programs  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  and other operating expenses 
we allocate our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available projects  the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to customers 
the decrease in cost during  compared to the same period in  is primarily attributable to less direct material purchased for development programs and a decrease in overhead allocated to research and development 
we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the light scanning technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expense 
change change in thousands sales  marketing  general and administrative   sales  marketing  general and administrative expense includes compensation and support costs for marketing  sales  management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including legal and accounting services  consultants and other operating expenses 
the increase in cost during compared to the same period in is primarily due to increased sales and marketing expense related to promoting our accessory pico projector products 
interest income and expense

in march and december  one of the issuers redeemed a total of  of our slars at par value through a voluntary lottery redemption program 
in december  we sold our remaining slars for proceeds of approximately million and recorded a loss of  which is included in realized loss on sale of investment securities on the consolidated statements of operations 
gain loss on derivative instruments  net 
change change in thousands gain loss on derivative instruments  net  the change in gain loss on derivative instruments  net is primarily driven by the change in value of warrants we issued in to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with certain notes 
the warrants met the definition of derivative instruments that must be accounted for as liabilities because we could not engage in certain corporate transactions affecting the common stock unless we made a cash payment to the holders of the warrants 
we recorded changes in the fair values of the warrants in the statement of operations each period 
as of december    warrants remained outstanding and subsequently expired unexercised by december  the change in value of the warrants of  in was recorded as a non operating gain and is included in gain loss on derivative instruments  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits available to offset future taxable income  if any  will expire in varying amounts from to if not previously utilized 
in  million in net operating loss carry forwards are scheduled to expire 
the research and development tax credits and the remaining net operating losses are scheduled to expire between and in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that such a change of ownership occurred during and that the annual utilization of loss carry forwards generated through the period of that change will be limited to approximately million 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at december  or at december  we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized no interest and penalties

of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands bar code revenue  pico projector revenue n a total product revenue   bar code revenue includes the sales of rov and our discontinued flic bar code scanners 
the decrease in bar code revenue for compared to was due to decreased purchasing volume of small and mid sized businesses as a result of the global economic conditions 
as a result of this downturn we reduced our sales and marketing efforts on the bar code product

lockheed martin holds a prime contract with the us government for development of the soldier worn display 
our backlog of development contracts at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts at december  the decrease in backlog from was primarily attributed to completion of government and commercial development contracts in and reduced contract activity as we moved closer to the commercialization of products based on our picop display engine

we have funded operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock  convertible preferred stock  warrants  the issuance of convertible debt and  to a lesser extent  from development contract revenues and product sales 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities  available for sale 
we anticipate lowering our cash used in operations in significantly  through a combination of sharing development and commercialization costs of the next generation picop technology based on direct green lasers with our development partners  limiting our future investment into advancement of the current generation picop technology based on synthetic green lasers  moving future product development to original design manufacturers lowering our working capital requirements through a recently completed restructuring of inventory cycles with major suppliers  reducing our operating costs through a workforce reduction completed in january  in addition to other measures 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through august we will require additional cash to fund our operating plan past that time 
we are introducing new products into an emerging market which creates significant uncertainty about our ability to accurately project revenue  costs and cash flows 
if the level of sales anticipated by our financial plan is not achieved or our working capital requirements are higher than planned  we will need to raise additional cash sooner or take actions to reduce operating expenses 
we plan to obtain additional cash through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that additional cash will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
this limitation of operations could include reducing our planned investment in working capital to fund revenue growth and delaying development projects resulting in reductions in staff  operating costs  capital expenditures and investment in research and development 
in august  we entered into a committed equity financing facility under which we may sell up to the lesser of million or  shares of our common stock to azimuth opportunity  ltd over a month term 
during  we raised approximately million through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock under this facility 
as of december  we had the lesser of approximately million shares or million of common stock remaining available under the facility  though we may not be able to sell shares under the facility in the amounts desired or at all 
as a result of the late filing of a current report on form k reporting the results of our annual meeting of shareholders  we are not eligible to use form s for registering new securities for sale by us 
we would again be eligible to use form s on july  if we remain current in our filings as provided in form s until that time 
we can also register sales of shares by us or investors on form s we have received a report from our independent public accounting firm regarding the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  that includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these financial statements are prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
cash used in operating activities totaled million during  compared to million during during  the increased cash outlay was primarily driven by the investment in working capital to build inventory and accelerate revenue growth from picop based product sales and a higher operating loss 
we had the following material gains and charges  and changes in assets and liabilities during the year ended december  inventory ending inventory increased by million over the change in inventory includes an increase in inventory of approximately million related to our pico projector product offset by inventory write downs of million

our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with oems  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
in order to maintain our exclusive rights under our license agreement with the university of washington  we are obligated to make royalty payments to the university of washington with respect to the virtual retinal display technology 
if we are successful in establishing original equipment manufacturer co development and joint venture arrangements  we expect our partners to fund certain non recurring engineering costs for technology development and or for product development 
nevertheless  we expect our cash requirements to remain high as we expand our activities and operations with the objective of commercializing our light scanning technology 
the following table lists our contractual obligations in thousands payments d ue by period less than year years years more than years total contractual obligations open purchase obligations  minimum payments under capital leases minimum payments under operating leases  minimum payments under long term debt minimum payments under research  royalty and licensing agreements   total   open purchase obligations represent commitments to purchase inventory  materials  capital equipment  maintenance agreements and other goods used in the normal operation of our business 
license and royalty obligations continue through the lives of the underlying patents  which is currently through at least new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued guidance which provides amendments to establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and expands the disclosures required for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements that are entered into or are materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the implementation of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance which allows exclusion of software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance if the software is included with tangible products and is essential to the tangible product functionality 
the guidance becomes effective for revenue arrangements that are entered into or are materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market liquidity risks as of the end of  all of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale have variable interest rates or are equity investments traded in active markets 
therefore  we believe our exposure to market and interest rate risks is not material 
our investment policy generally directs that the investment managers should select investments to achieve the following goals principal preservation  adequate liquidity and return 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale securities portfolio are comprised of short term highly rated money market savings accounts and equity investments 
the values of cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale by maturity date as of december   are as follows amount percent cash and cash equivalents  less than one year  one to two years greater than five years foreign exchange rate risk all of our development contract payments are made in us dollars 
however  in the future we may enter into development contracts in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have purchase orders and supply agreements in foreign currencies and may enter into such agreements from time to time in the future 
we believe our exposure to currency fluctuations related to these arrangements is not material 
we intend to enter into foreign currency hedges to offset material exposure to currency fluctuations when we can adequately determine the timing and amounts of the exposure 
in may  we purchased foreign currency contracts granting us options to purchase an aggregate of million euro at on expiration dates in august  october  and november  the expiration dates related to estimated product component purchase dates
