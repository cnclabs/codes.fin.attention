critical accounting policies bankshares financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our financial statements could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting asc  contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses has two basic components the general allowance and the specific allowance 
the general allowance is developed following the accounting principles contained in asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and represents the largest component of the total allowance 
it is determined by aggregating un criticized loans and unimpaired loans by loan type based on common purpose  collateral  repayment source or other credit characteristics and then applying factors which in the judgment of management represent the expected losses over the life of the loans 
in determining those factors  we consider the following delinquencies and overall risk ratings  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of the borrowers management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit by individual credit size and by class of loans  quality of loan review system and the effect of external factors eg  competition and regulatory requirements 
asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan is the basis upon which we determine specific reserves on individual loans which comprise the specific allowance 
specific loans to be evaluated for impairment are identified based on the borrower s loan size and the loan s risk rating  collateral position and payment history 
if it is determined that it is likely that the bank will not receive full payment in a timely manner  the loan is determined to be impaired 
each such identified loan is then evaluated to determine the amount of reserve that is appropriate based on asc this standard also requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of expected future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
goodwill 
bankshares adopted asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill related to the aia acquisitions was tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warranted 
for the year ended december   bankshares tested the goodwill carrying value 
based upon the results of the testing  bankshares concluded that there was impairment during we recorded an impairment charge of thousand in under asc  acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its useful life 
the costs of other intangible assets  based on independent valuation and or internal valuations  are amortized over their estimated lives 
on december   the bank entered into and closed on a stock purchase agreement to sell the insurance agencies  which eliminated the goodwill and intangible assets carried on our books 
share based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued asc  stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment 
asc requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and nonvested shares  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
compensation cost has been measured using the black scholes model to estimate fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
deferred tax asset 
bankshares routinely evaluates the likelihood of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the analysis is used to determine if a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary 
our analysis reviews various forms of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and if so to what degree a valuation allowance is warranted 
we considered positive evidence such as financial results  previous earnings patterns  the recent history of loan charge offs  nonperforming assets  oreo expenses  multiyear business projections and the potential realization of nol carry forwards within the prescribed time periods 
we considered several different economic scenarios in evaluating whether the projected income in future periods was sufficient to recover the nol over the prescribed period 
in addition  we considered tax planning strategies that would impact the timing and extent of taxable income 
the projected performance metrics over the period of nol recognition indicates that it is more likely than not that bankshares will have sufficient taxable income to recognize the deferred tax assets as of december  therefore  bankshares has concluded that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is not necessary as of december  results of operations compared to for the year ended december   net income amounted to thousand  compared to net loss of million for basic and diluted net income loss per common share was in and in earnings loss per share from continuing operations was at december  compared to at december  return on average equity was in compared to in return on average assets was in compared to in the net interest margin was in which compares to in the key drivers of our improved net income in were an improved net interest margin  reduced credit and oreo related costs  reduced operating expenses  and gains on sale of investment securities

the cost of interest bearing liabilities amounted to million in compared to million in this million year over year reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities completely offset the million decline in earnings from our asset base  and was driven by declines in the rates paid by the company on each category of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table illustrates average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and related income  expense and corresponding weighted average yields and rates

in  we actively added investment securities to the balance sheet 
the securities added to the balance sheet provide positive returns on excess liquidity generated by the bank s operations  including by the bank s deposit gathering initiatives  and are an attractive alternative to the very low yields received from federal funds sold 
a certain portion of the bank s excess liquidity is invested in federal funds sold

the company has made significant efforts to be responsive to the lending needs in the markets served  while maintaining sound asset quality and credit practices 
we grant credit to commercial markets  commercial real estate  real estate construction  and residential real estate and consumer loans in the normal course of business

the following tables summarize the composition of the loan portfolio by dollar amount and each segment as a percentage of the total loan portfolio as of the dates indicated loan portfolio as of december  dollars in thousands residential real estate commercial real estate construction land commercial and industrial consumer non real estate other less unearned discount fees total loans ratio of loans to total year end loans by portfolio segment as of december  residential real estate commercial real estate construction land commercial and industrial consumer non real estate total loans substantially all loans are initially underwritten based on identifiable cash flows and supported by appropriate advance rates on collateral which is independently valued 
commercial loans are generally secured by accounts receivable  equipment and business assets 
commercial real estate is secured by income producing properties of all types 
real estate construction loans are supported by projects which generally require an appropriate level of pre sales or pre leasing 
generally  all commercial and real estate loans have full recourse to the owners and or sponsors 
residential real estate is secured by first or second trusts on both owner occupied and investor owned residential properties 
as noted in the table above loans secured by various types of real estate constitute a significant portion of total loans 
commercial real estate loans represent the largest dollar exposure 
substantially all of these loans are secured by properties in the metropolitan washington  dc area with the heaviest concentration in northern virginia and fairfax county in particular 
risk is managed through diversification by sub market  property type  and loan size 
risk is further managed by seeking investment property loans with multiple tenants and by emphasizing owner occupied loans 
the average loan size in this portfolio is thousand as of december  the table also shows a substantial reduction in the real estate construction portion of the portfolio 
this reflects the results of management s efforts to de emphasize this type of lending 
new originations in this segment are being underwritten in the context of current market conditions and are particularly focused in sub markets which appear to be the strongest in the region 
legacy loans  particularly in the land portion of this portfolio  have been largely converted to amortizing loans with regular principal and interest payments 
we expect to see further reductions in our land exposure offset by potential increases in certain residential construction activities as market conditions improve 
loans secured by residential real estate have grown in aggregate 
this reflects substantial growth in our family first trust loans partially offset by the reductions in our family subordinate trust loans helocs and closed end nd mortgages 
all loans in both categories represent loans underwritten by us we do not purchase loans in this portfolio to customers with whom we have direct contact in the local communities we serve 
we believe that our underwriting criteria reflect current market conditions 
the portfolio of first mortgage loans had an average size per housing unit of thousand as of december  our subordinate trust loans averaged thousand per property as of december  while we recognize that the metropolitan washington  dc residential real estate market is in a nascent recovery  we believe our current underwriting standards  our emphasis on serving the sub markets we know  the granularity of our portfolio  and our continued reduction of our subordinate trust portfolio represent appropriate risk management for this portfolio 
the following table presents the maturities or repricing periods of selected loans outstanding at december  loan maturity distribution as of december  one year after one year after or less through five years five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial construction land total loans with fixed rates variable rates total asset quality we segregate loans meeting the criteria for special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss from non classified  or pass rated  loans 
we review the characteristics of each rating at least annually  generally during the first quarter of each year 
the characteristics of these ratings are as follows pass and watch rated loans risk ratings to are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition  appropriate collateral margins  appropriate cash flow to service the existing loans  and an appropriate leverage ratio 
the borrower has paid all obligations as agreed and it is expected that the borrower will maintain this type of payment history 
when necessary  acceptable personal guarantors support the loan 
special mention loans risk rating have a specific defined weakness in the borrower s operations and or the borrower s ability to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis 
the borrower s recent payment history is characterized by late payments 
bankshares risk exposure to special mention loans is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan 
the collateral is considered to be well managed  well maintained  accessible and readily marketable 
substandard loans risk rating are considered to have specific and well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of bankshares credit extension 
the payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment source may be inadequate to service the loan 
the estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and or ability of the personal guarantors to pay the loan may not adequately protect bankshares 
there is a distinct possibility that bankshares will sustain some loss if the deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term 
a substandard loan would not automatically meet our definition of an impaired loan unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower s performance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that bankshares will be unable to collect all amounts due substandard non accrual loans have the same characteristics as substandard loans 
however these loans have a non accrual classification most frequently because the borrower s principal or interest payments are days or more past due 
doubtful rated loans risk rating have all the weakness inherent in a loan that is classified as substandard but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the possibility of loss related to doubtful rated loans is extremely high 
loss risk rating rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future payment on the loan 
loss rated loans are fully charged off

internal risk ratings of special mention rating number  substandard rating number  doubtful rating number and loss rating number are deemed to be classified assets 
as part of our normal credit risk management practices  we regularly monitor the payment performance of our borrowers 
substantially all loans require some form of payment on a monthly basis  with a high percentage requiring regular amortization of principal 
however  certain helocs  commercial and industrial lines of credit and construction loans generally require only monthly interest payments 
when payments are days or more in arrears or when we determine that it is no longer prudent to recognize current interest income on a loan  we classify the loan as non accrual 
from time to time a loan may be past due for days or more but it is in process of collection and thus warrants remaining on accrual status 
as of december   we evaluated a residential real estate construction loan with a principal value of thousand loan that was more than days past due and determined that it should remain on accrual status 
in early  interest payments were brought current on this loan

the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting asc  contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of loans outstanding  compared to million or of loans outstanding  at december  these ratios exclude loans held for sale 
we have allocated thousand and million  respectively  of our allowance for loan losses at december  and december  for specific non performing loans 
in  we had net charge offs of million compared to million in and million in there was one loan past due and still accruing interest as of december  in the amount of thousand which was favorably resolved in there were no such loans at december  as part of our routine credit administration process  we engage an outside consulting firm to review our loan portfolio periodically 
the information from these reviews is used to monitor individual loans as well as to evaluate the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period  management takes into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by bankshares  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing loans 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
after charging off all known losses that have been incurred in the loan portfolio  management considers on a quarterly basis whether the allowance for loan losses remains adequate to cover its estimate of probable future losses  and establishes a provision for loan losses as appropriate 
as the loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses review process continues to evolve  there may be changes to elements of the allowance methodology and this may have an effect on the overall level of allowance maintained 
the following table represents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated analysis of the allowance for loan losses as of december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses chargeoffs commerical and industrial construction land residential real estate commercial real estate consumer non real estate total chargeoffs recoveries commerical and industrial construction land residential real estate commercial real estate consumer non real estate total recoveries net chargeoffs balance  end of period allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to non accrual loans x x x x x non performing assets to allowance for loan losses non performing assets to total assets net chargeoffs to average loans the following table provides a breakdown of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
however  management does not believe that the allowance for loan losses can be fragmented by category with any precision that would be useful to investors 
as such  the entire allowance is available for losses in any particular category  not withstanding this allocation 
the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses is based primarily upon those factors discussed above in computing the allowance for loan losses as a whole 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation and actual results are not necessarily indicative of the exact category of potential loan losses

nonaccrual loans 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent days or more 
we closely monitor individual loans  and relationship officers are charged with working with customers to resolve potential credit issues in a timely manner with minimum exposure to bankshares 
we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by bankshares  general economic conditions and other factors and external circumstances identified during the process of estimating losses in the company s loan portfolio 
on december   alliance bank had million in loans that were on nonaccrual status compared to loans that were on non accrual status totaling million at december  the million non accrual loan balance consists of a six loans all secured by residential and commercial real estate in the northern virginia area 
the specific allowance for impaired loans as of december  is thousand 
total non performing assets 
as of december   we had million of non performing assets on the balance sheet compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease is due to the sale of several oreo properties during and the resolution of several non accrual loans 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to as of december  from as of december   a basis point improvement 
the improvement in the non performing assets to total asset ratio is significant in light of the million decline in total assets over the same period 
the shift in non performing asset categories reflects the migration of loans from impaired status  to non accrual status and from there to oreo as seen in the following table

sba securities are us government agency securities 
for presentation purposes  they are separated in the table above 
during the year ended december   the size of the trading asset portfolio was significantly reduced as part of an overall strategic direction to minimize the trading asset portfolio 
the december  level of million is a decrease of million from the december  level of million 
in particular the entire floating rate sba securities portfolio  million of the us government agency portfolio and million of the pcmo portfolio were sold in the company continued to execute the strategy to minimize the trading asset portfolio during  eliminating its us government agency trading assets and further reducing its pcmo trading securities 
trading securities classified as level beginning in the third quarter of  investment and debt markets experienced a period of significant distress and dysfunction 
currently  investment and debt markets remain depressed 
although certain markets have improved  the fair value of an investment security may not be the same as a liquidation value 
as such  level evaluations of the fair value are used 
the fair value methods used to evaluate trading assets include typical market spreads for the instruments  option adjusted spreads  swap curves  discounted cashflow models  default levels  prepayment spreads  tranche classification  previously observable non distressed valuations and bond issuance rates and spreads for investment and non investment grade instruments 
we believe this approach more accurately reflects the fair value of pcmo and agency securities

additionally  the securities are pledged as collateral for certain borrowing transactions and repurchase agreements 
the total amount of the investment securities accounted for under available for sale accounting was million on december  compared to million at december  targeted efforts to strategically restructure our balance sheet led to shifts in our investment portfolio mix along with periods where the investment portfolio was smaller than the december  level of million 
the investment securities tax equivalent yield was as of december  compared to the december  yield of  due to fluctuations in market rates and changes in the portfolio duration and mix

the abmd division did not generate any gains on loan sales in  however  there were gains of thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and respectively 
in the year ended december   we had a net gain of million on the sale of investment securities 
this represents an increase of thousand from the net gain of million 
the net loss on the sale of investment securities for was thousand 
bankshares views the available for sale investment portfolio as a tool in managing the overall balance sheet and liquidity positions of the organization 
from time to time  bankshares will sell investment securities to achieve certain business objectives 
these sales may result in gains or losses depending on the timing and book value of instruments sold 
trading activity and fair value adjustments recorded for the year ended december  resulted in a net loss of thousand  compared to a net gain of thousand for the same period in  a decrease of thousand 
the net loss of is primarily driven by the negative adjustment of thousand on the fhlb advance 
the movement of interest spreads had an adverse effect on the fhlb advance s value 
at contractual maturity the fhlb advance will become due at par and any unrealized loss will be recognized as trading income as maturity approaches 
as december   trading activity and fair value adjustments associated with the trading assets generated a net loss of thousand 
trading activity and fair value adjustments for the year ended december  was a million loss 
our other non interest income is predominately from atm fees and investment management fees which amounted to thousand  thousand and thousand  for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company does not expect to generate significant non interest income from investment management fees in future periods  due to the company s decision to phase out investment management operations during the third quarter of non interest expense during  we made important progress toward our strategic goal of optimizing profitability by decreasing our non interest expenses 
in  we significantly decreased oreo expense and other operating expenses 
non interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to the level of million  a decrease of million 
a key component of non interest expense is salary and benefits expense 
this expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to the level of million 
occupancy and furniture and equipment costs were million in both and oreo expense was thousand for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million is attributed to lower outstanding oreo balances during as well as the lower volume of new foreclosures during the majority of the decrease in oreo expense is the decrease of the valuation adjustment year over year 
for  we recorded thousand in valuation adjustments compared to million for other operating expenses amounted to million in  compared to million in non interest expense for amounted to million  compared to the level of million 
salary and benefits expenses in and were million and million  respectively 
other operating expenses amounted to million in and in million in oreo expenses were million in  compared to million in the million includes write downs on various oreo properties totaling million 
the components of other operating expenses for the periods referenced were as follows other operating expense years ended december  dollars in thousands business development office expense bank operations expense data processing professional fees fdic insurance other total fredericksburg business initiative

as of december   the bank is continuing to market the space for a potential branch site in the cosner s corner area in fredericksburg 
bankshares has recorded a liability of thousand as of december  for the estimated present value of the potential differential between the contractual rental obligations and potential subleasing income 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of thousand in compared to income tax benefit of million in our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  bankshares routinely evaluates the likelihood of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the analysis is used to determine if a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary 
our analysis reviews various forms of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and if so to what degree a valuation allowance is warranted 
for our analysis of our deferred tax assets as of december   we considered specific positive evidence such as financial results  previous earnings patterns  the recent history of loan charge offs  nonperforming assets  oreo expenses  multiyear business projections and the potential realization of net operating loss nol carry forwards within the prescribed time periods 
we considered several different economic scenarios in evaluating whether the projected income in future periods was sufficient to recover the nol over the prescribed period 
in addition  we considered tax planning strategies that would impact the timing and extent of our taxable income 
the projected performance metrics over the period of nol recognition indicates that it is more likely than not that bankshares will have sufficient taxable income to recognize the deferred tax assets as of december  therefore  bankshares has concluded that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is not necessary as of december  deposits we seek deposits within our market area by offering high quality customer service  by using technology to deliver deposit services effectively and by paying competitive interest rates 
due to the government sponsored tax credit program for first time home buyers in  there was an increase in real estate activity in our market areas  and this translated into larger demand deposits for the bank 
a significant portion of our client base and deposits are directly related to home sales and refinance activity 
as the economic conditions improved in our clients have experienced increased deposit balances 
at december   the deposit portfolio was million  a decrease of million compared to the december  level of million 
the interest bearing deposits cost the bank for the year ended or basis points less than the year ended average cost of 
as key interest rates declined over the past year  we repriced deposits at a lower level 
in addition  the rates on time deposits have decreased substantially 
as we have the opportunity to reprice time deposits  we are able to realize significant interest rate savings 
management s strategic decision to increase core deposits has shown positive results 
at december   our non interest bearing demand deposits were million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
average non interest bearing demand deposits were million at december  compared to average demand deposits of million at december  an increase of million 
the disparity between the december  balance of non interest bearing deposits of million and the average balance of non interest bearing deposits of million is directly related to seasonal and cyclical changes in our title and escrow deposit client base 
frequently  our clients experience strong deposit growth around the end of a month or quarter 
we currently use wholesale brokered deposits 
we believe these types of funds offer a reliable stable source of funds for the bank 
frequently the interest rates associated with wholesale brokered deposits are significantly lower than general customer rates in our markets 
as market conditions warrant and balance sheet needs dictate  we may continue to participate in the wholesale brokered certificate of deposit market 
as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer and or broker 
over the long term  management s strategic goal is to lower our wholesale brokered deposits and replace them with attractively priced local commercial and retail deposits 
as of december   we had million of wholesale brokered certificates of deposit which is million lower than the december  level of million 
as of december   we had no wholesale brokered deposit accounted for on a fair value basis compared to a single wholesale brokered deposit in the amount of million in that matured in early at december   deposits were million  an increase of million from the december  level of million

the cost of issuance of the trust preferred securities was approximately thousand 
this cost was amortized over a five year period from the issue date and has been fully amortized 
the interest rate associated with the trust preferred securities is month libor plus subject to quarterly interest rate adjustments 
under the indenture governing the trust preferred securities  bankshares has the right to defer interest for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods

management does not expect the restrictions on tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities that were enacted by the dodd frank act to impact the tier capital status of the trust preferred capital notes  as the dodd frank act s restrictions generally do not apply to trust preferred securities issued prior to enactment by institutions with fewer than billion in assets

we offer this product as an accommodation to larger retail and commercial customers that request safety for their funds beyond the fdic deposit insurance limits or as part of a series of cash management products 
we believe this product offers us a stable source of financing at a reasonable market rate of interest 
we do not have any open repos with broker dealers 
the fhlb is a key source of funding for us 
during the periods presented  we have used overnight advances daily rate credit to support our short term liquidity needs 
on a longer term basis  we augment our funding portfolio with our two fhlb advances  one of which is accounted for on a fair value basis  and one of which is accounted for on a cost basis

trading liabilities classified as level beginning in the third quarter of and continuing through the present time  the investment and debt markets have displayed increased levels of volatility and  at times  have acted in a distressed and dysfunctional manner 
in evaluating the fair value of funding instruments  we determined that the typical valuation techniques did not take into account the distressed investment and debt markets 
as such  we considered other factors such as typical spreads for the instruments  option adjusted spreads  swap curves  discounted cashflow models  previously observable non distressed valuations and bond issuance rates and spreads for investment and non investment grade instruments 
as of december  and december   the fair value of the long term fhlb advance accounted for on a fair value basis was million and million  respectively 
liquidity bankshares specifically focuses on liquidity management to meet the demand for funds from our depositors and lending clients as well as expenses that we incur in operation of our business 
we have a formal liquidity management policy and a contingency funding policy that are used to assist management in executing the liquidity strategies necessary for the bank 
similar to the other banking organizations  the bank monitors the need for funds to support depositor activities and funding of loans 
our client base includes a significant number of title and escrow businesses which have more deposit inflows and outflows than a traditional commercial business relationship 
the bank maintains additional liquidity sources to support the needs of this client base 
as noted in the risk factors section of this form k  loss of relationship officers or clients could have a material impact our liquidity position through a reduction in average deposits 
our funding department and the chief financial officer monitor our overall liquidity position daily 
we can and will draw upon federal funds lines with correspondent banks  draw upon reverse repurchase agreement lines with correspondent banks and use fhlb advances as needed 
our deposit customers frequently have lower deposit balances in the middle of the month  and balances generally rise toward the end of each month 
as such  we use wholesale funding techniques to support our balance sheet and asset portfolios  although our longer term plan is to increase deposits from our local retail and commercial deposits and maintain available wholesale funding sources as additional liquidity 
as of december   bankshares had million in cash to support the business activities and deposit flows of our clients 
the bank maintains credit lines at the fhlb and other correspondent banks 
at december   the bank had a total credit line of million with the fhlb with an unused portion of million 
borrowings with the fhlb have certain collateral requirements and are subject to disbursement approval by the fhlb 
at december   the bank has million in secured borrowing capacity both reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks 
as of december   the bank did not have any outstanding borrowings from its correspondent banks 
all borrowings from correspondent banks are subject to disbursement approval 
the bank is also eligible to borrow from the federal reserve discount window subject to the collateral requirements and other terms and conditions that may exist 
in addition to the borrowing capacity described above  bankshares and the bank may sell investment securities  loans and other assets to generate additional liquidity 
we anticipate maintaining sufficient liquidity to protect depositors  provide for business growth and comply with regulatory requirements

these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the overall liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of these off balance sheet arrangements  and bankshares obligations in connection with its trust preferred securities  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk alm risk management 
we engage a consulting firm to model our short term and long term interest rate risk profile 
the model includes basic business assumptions  interest rates  repricing information and other relevant market data necessary to project our interest rate risk 
the board of directors has established interest rate risk limits for both short term and long term interest rate exposure 
on a periodic basis  management reports to the board of directors on our base interest rate risk profile and expectations of changes in the profiles based on certain interest rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity short term interest rate risk 
bankshares asset liability management alm process evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
this analysis involves shocking the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of bankshares shorter term interest rate risk 
this analysis is accomplished by assuming a static balance sheet over a period of time with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under various rate scenarios 
these assumptions include prepayments  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant by bankshares 
the alm model results for december  are shown in the table below 
assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points  the results indicate bankshares would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by 
assuming a shift downward of basis points  bankshares would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by 
economic value of equity long term interest rate risk 
the economic value of equity process models the cashflows of financial instruments to maturity 
the model incorporates growth and pricing assumptions to develop a baseline eve 
the interest rates used in the model are then shocked for an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the results of the shocked model are compared to the baseline results to determine the percentage change in eve under the various scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the table below shows as of december  and alm model results under various interest rate shocks december  december  interest rate shocks nii eve nii eve bp bp bp bp all results above are within bankshares current interest rate risk policy guidelines 
interest rate gap 
in addition to the nii and eve models  management reviews our static gap position 
the cumulative negative gap position within one year was million  or of total assets  at december  while this measurement technique is common in the financial services industry  it has limitations and is not our sole tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
we do not believe this model accurately reflects bankshares true short term and long term interest rate exposure 
as an example  million of the investment and trading securities at december  are classified as greater than five years due to the contractual maturity of the instruments 
investment and trading securities are easily marketed and can be liquidated in a short period of time 
as a result  it is reasonable to consider a portion of  or perhaps all of  the million of investment and trading securities as the within three month category  which further suggests a more balanced short term interest rate position for bankshares 
the following table reflects our december  static interest rate gap position december  maturing or repricing within over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities trading securities loans interest bearing deposits federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposit accounts savings accounts iras time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb long term advances  at fair value fhlb long term advances customer repurchase agreements other borrowings trust preferred capital notes total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets during the next twelve months million of time deposits are due to reprice or mature 
the most recent repricing of the brokered deposits reflected an interest rate savings of several hundred basis points 
the impact of future repricings on interest expense will depend upon the interest rate environment at that time 
interest rate risk management summary 
as part of our interest rate risk management  we typically use the trading and investment portfolios and our wholesale funding instruments to balance our interest rate exposure 
there is no guarantee that the risk management techniques and balance sheet management strategies we employ will be effective in periods of rapid rate movements or extremely volatile periods 
we believe our strategies are prudent and within our policy guidelines in the base case of our modeling efforts as of december
