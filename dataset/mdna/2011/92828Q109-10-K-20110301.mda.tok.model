overview organization virtus investment partners  inc the company  we  us  our or virtus  a delaware corporation  operates a multi manager asset management business through its wholly owned subsidiaries 
virtus commenced operations on november  through a reverse merger with duff phelps corporation 
from to  we were a majority owned indirect subsidiary of pnx 
on january   a subsidiary of pnx acquired the outstanding shares of the company not already owned and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of pnx 
on october   after the sale of convertible preferred stock to harris bankcorp  we became an indirect  majority owned subsidiary of pnx 
on december   pnx distributed of virtus common stock to pnx stockholders in a spin off transaction  excluding the net assets and business of the company s subsidiary  goodwin  which had historically been a wholly owned subsidiary of the company

our business we are a provider of investment management products and services to individuals and institutions 
we operate a multi manager investment management business  comprised of affiliated managers  each having its own distinct investment style  autonomous investment process and brand 
we believe our customers value this approach  especially institutional customers who appreciate individual managers with distinctive cultures and styles 
investors have an array of needs driven by factors such as market conditions  risk tolerance and investment goals 
a key element of our business is offering a variety of investment styles and multiple disciplines to meet those needs 
to that end  for our mutual funds  we supplement the investment capabilities of our affiliated managers with those of select unaffiliated sub advisors 
we do that by partnering with unaffiliated sub advisors whose strategies we believe appeal to investors and are not typically available to retail mutual fund customers 
we provide our products in a number of forms and through multiple distribution channels 
our retail products include open end mutual funds  closed end funds  variable insurance funds and separately managed accounts 
our fund family of open end funds is distributed primarily through intermediaries 
our closed end funds trade on the new york stock exchange 
our variable insurance trust provides investment options in variable annuities and life insurance products distributed by third party insurance companies 
retail separately managed accounts are comprised of intermediary programs  sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms  and private client accounts  which are offerings to the high net worth clients of our affiliated managers 
we also manage institutional accounts for corporations  multi employer retirement funds and foundations  endowments and special purpose funds 
our earnings are primarily driven by asset based investment management fees charged on these various products 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are calculated using daily or weekly average assets or assets at the end of the preceding quarter 

table of contents market developments the global financial markets showed improvements in and the major us equity indexes rose for a second consecutive year  demonstrating that the post recession recovery which has been long anticipated may be gaining traction 
the fourth quarter of marked the sixth consecutive quarter of positive real gdp growth for the nation 
despite modest improvements late in the fourth quarter  unemployment remained at historically high levels throughout  leading the federal reserve to announce a second round of quantitative easing with plans to purchase an additional billion in treasury securities by mid in an attempt to keep longer term interest rates low 
the markets ended the year by reacting positively to bipartisan support for extending bush era tax cuts for two more years 
changes in our assets under management are driven in great part by the performance of the equity markets 
the dow jones industrial average ended the year at  with a total return for the year  while the standard poor s index closed out at  with a total return for the year 
we saw growing interest in equity funds earlier in the year and  by the fourth quarter  percent of our mutual fund sales came from equity products  compared with percent in the fourth quarter of however uncertainties remain about the long term nature of the economic recovery 
the inconsistent nature of the recovery  and the possibility that further economic gains could be disrupted by local or global events such as adverse changes in interest rates  significant shifts in commodity supplies or prices  political unrest  or even government initiatives  could adversely impact interest in our investment products and services and  consequently  revenue and earnings 
assets under management assets under management increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in assets under management was driven primarily by positive net flows of billion  market appreciation of billion  and completion of a strategic initiative with the establishment of the virtus variable insurance trust  representing billion in additional assets 
positive net flows of billion in were primarily due to strong sales of long term open end mutual funds 
during  the company s equity assets increased to of total assets under management compared with in fixed income assets represented of total assets under management at december   compared with at the end of  and money market assets declined to of total assets under management at the end of from at december  operating results in total revenue increased to million from million in revenues increased in as compared with primarily as a result of increased mutual fund revenue and the addition of the virtus variable insurance trust 
average assets under management  which correspond to the company s fee earning asset levels  were billion for the year ended december   an improvement of from billion for the year ended december  operating income improved by million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in primarily due to increased revenues driven by higher levels of average fee earning assets under management and a continued expense discipline that allowed the company to improve profitability in spite of the increased variable expenses that come with the growing levels of sales achieved by the company in

the positive net flows were primarily the result of strong sales of long term open end mutual fund products 
market appreciation for assets under management for the year ended december  was consistent with the improving performance of the securities markets during the same period 
money market assets declined for the year ended december  as investors continued to shift assets out of these products due to historically low interest rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  at december   we managed billion in total assets representing an increase of billion or from the billion managed at december  the increase in assets under management for the year ended december  was due primarily to market appreciation of billion 
the market appreciation experienced for all products for the year ended december  was due to positive performance of the securities markets  particularly in the second and third quarters of also contributing to the increase in assets under management was positive net flows of billion 
net flows of billion for the year ended december   compared to net outflows of billion for the year ended december   improved due to a combination of improving market conditions and investor sentiment and strong performance and sales for several of our open end mutual fund products 

table of contents average fee earning assets under management and average basis points the following table summarizes average fee earning assets under management and average management fee basis points excluding goodwin as of december  average fees earned in average fee earning assets expressed in bps in millions products mutual funds long term mutual funds money market variable insurance funds separately managed accounts institutional products all products average fees earned are net of non affiliated sub advisory fees 
average fees earned are net of non affiliated sub advisory fees and fund reimbursements 
the average fee earning assets under management and average fees earned expressed in basis points presented in the table above are intended to provide information in the analysis of our asset based revenue 
money market  long term mutual fund fees and variable insurance fund fees are calculated based on average daily net assets 
average fees earned by variable insurance funds will vary based on several factors  including the asset mix and fund reimbursements 
the average fee rate earned in by our variable insurance funds reflects the fourth quarter timing of the vit transaction 
in subsequent periods when our variable insurance funds will be included in average fees earned for a full period  we would expect lower average fees as compared with separately managed accounts are generally calculated based on end of the preceding quarter s asset values 
institutional fees are calculated based on an average of month end balances 
structured finance product fees  which are included in institutional products  are calculated based on a combination of the underlying cash flows and the principal value of the product 
our product mix shifted towards higher fee earning assets for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year as assets under management from equity products  which have higher fees  increased in proportion to our overall portfolio 
in addition  average fees earned were approximately two basis points higher than normal during the year ended december  due to recognition of million of revenue on structured finance products for subordinated management fees earned in prior periods that were not recognized as revenue until payment of such fees resumed in the first quarter of upon meeting collateral quality tests

the increase in average fee earning assets under management for the year ended december  was due primarily to market appreciation of billion and overall positive net flows of billion  primarily resulting from strong sales of long term open end mutual fund products 
revenues increased at a higher rate than assets under management due to a lower proportion of money market assets which have lower investment management fee rates than our other products  and a higher proportion of equity and fixed income assets 
money market assets represented of total assets under management at december  compared to at december  offsetting these increases were higher fund expense reimbursements resulting from a new fund administration agreement executed in april also contributing to the increase were subordinated management fees recognized on structured finance products that could not be recognized in the year ended december  as the collateral being managed did not meet payment requirements at that time 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  investment management fees decreased million or for the year ended december  due primarily to the absence of investment management fees from goodwin  which was no longer part of the company after the spin off  which generated revenues of million for the year ended december   including million related to the pnx general account 
also contributing to the decline in investment management fees was an billion or decrease in average fee earning assets under management  exclusive of goodwin  as compared to the year ended december  average fee earning assets under management decreased compared to the prior period primarily as a result of declines in the securities markets in the second half of and first quarter of  causing a decrease in the market value of assets under management and higher redemption rates  resulting in lower average assets under management and investment management fees 
distribution and service fees year ended december  compared to year ended december  distribution and service fees  which are asset based fees earned from open end mutual funds for distribution services we perform on their behalf  increased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to higher assets under management 
the increase in fees also resulted in a corresponding increase in trail commissions  which are a component of distribution expenses 
trail commissions represent asset based payments to our distribution partners based on a percentage of our assets under management 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  distribution and service fees declined by million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to lower assets under management 
the decrease in fees was substantially offset by a corresponding decrease in trail commissions  which are a component of distribution expenses 
administration and transfer agent fees year ended december  compared to year ended december  administration and transfer agent fees increased million or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
administration and transfer agent fees represent fees earned from our open end mutual funds  variable insurance funds and certain of the closed end funds for fund administration and transfer agent services 
fund administration fees for certain open end mutual funds increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to changes in fund administration contracts discussed further below 
transfer agent fees  which are reported net of sub transfer agent expenses  increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to higher average mutual fund assets under management 
the company uses outside service providers to perform certain functions related to fund administration and transfer agent services 
effective january   a new fund administration agreement was executed with our open end mutual funds 
under the prior agreement  the fees  which covered all fund administration services  were paid directly to the company by the funds and were recorded as revenue 
a portion of the fees received by the company were remitted to third party service providers for services performed on behalf of the funds  and were recorded as a distribution and administration expense 
as a result of the new agreement  the funds now directly contract for the third party services and fees paid by the funds directly to the service providers are not reflected as either revenue or expenses of the company  resulting in a decrease in revenues and a corresponding decrease in expenses in as compared to prior year periods 
for the year ended december   million of payments to third party service providers were recorded as revenue and expense of the company 
in april  an amendment to the fund administration agreement was executed with the open end mutual funds that changed and increased the fee rates received by the company 
in connection with the amendment  the company implemented additional expense caps that require the company to reimburse funds for certain expenses that exceed defined thresholds  resulting in higher expense fee waivers for the year ended december  which are recorded as a reduction to investment management fees 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  administration and transfer agent fees decreased million or primarily due to decreases in fund administration and transfer agent fees 
fund administration fees decreased million or due to a decline in average fee earning assets under management upon which these fees are based 
transfer agent fees decreased million or due to a decline in the number of accounts and a change in the contract with the service provider which also reduced our cost to provide these services 
for the year ended december   million of payments to third party service providers were recorded as revenue and expense of the company 
other income and fees year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income and fees increased million primarily due to an increase in fees earned for the distribution of unaffiliated products

operating expenses employment expenses distribution and administrative expenses other operating expenses restructuring and severance goodwill and intangible asset impairments intangible asset amortization total operating expenses employment expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  employment expenses of million increased million or as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increases in variable compensation  both sales and performance based 
the increases in variable compensation are the result of higher sales and improved profitability and operating metrics in as compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  employment expenses decreased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the exclusion of goodwin after the spin off accounted for million of the decrease 
the remaining decrease is due primarily to reductions in variable compensation  such as commissions and incentive compensation  of million 
also contributing to the decrease were reductions in salaries  benefits  and payroll taxes mainly as a result of lower staffing levels for the year ended december   reflecting the full year impact of significant reductions in staff that occurred in distribution and administrative expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  distribution and administrative expenses increased million or in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increases were primarily attributable to asset based trail commissions paid to our distribution partners which increased million consistent with increases in our assets under management 
trail commissions are fees we pay to broker dealers for providing sales  marketing and distribution services to investors of our mutual funds 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales based fees paid to third party distribution partners which increased million in the year ended december  due to higher sales 
these increases were partially offset by decreased third party service provider fees in compared to as these fees are no longer paid by the company 
as discussed further under the administration and transfer agent fee caption above  effective january   certain administration fees due to a third party service provider are no longer reflected as revenue or expenses of the company in  resulting in a decrease in distribution and administration expenses compared to prior year periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  distribution and administrative expenses decreased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to million in decreased asset based expenses paid to our distribution partners including trail commissions and other distribution costs 
fees paid to our fund administrator  which are also asset based  decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  consistent with lower average assets under management 
other operating expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  other operating expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year 
the modest increase  despite larger increases in assets under management and sales in as compared to  is a result of management s continued efforts to control fixed operating costs 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
other operating expenses attributable to goodwin  which is no longer a part of the company effective as of the spin off  were million for the year ended december  these expenses were not incurred for the year ended december  for the year ended december   certain services totaling million were provided to us by our former parent 
we have eliminated or replaced these services  at a lower cost  by hiring additional staff to perform the same services or contracting with external providers 
the savings have been partially offset by new expenses related to our being a standalone publicly traded company 
restructuring and severance we incurred million and million of severance costs in and  respectively  resulting from staff reductions and changes in the company and at our affiliates 
in  we incurred severance costs of million resulting from staff reductions related to the outsourcing of certain of our transfer agent functions and other reductions as we continued to streamline our operations 
we also vacated office space at two of our affiliates resulting in charges of million 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment there were no goodwill or intangible asset impairments for the years ended december  and as the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
in  we recorded pre tax non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we determined that several triggering events had occurred during the year as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines  a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
based on the results on our impairment assessment  we recorded million of goodwill and million of intangible asset impairments 
the primary drivers of the impairment were the reduction in assets under management due to markets and valuation multiples for asset managers being at multi year lows 
intangible asset amortization year ended december  compared to year ended december  amortization expense of million for the year ended december  decreased from the prior year by million or due to a number of intangible assets related to institutional contracts becoming fully amortized in the last twelve months 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of the lower remaining carrying value of our intangible assets after the impairment charges incurred in other income and expenses other income expense  net year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expense decreased to income of million for the year ended december  due to decreases in the market value of trading securities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expense increased million to income of million for the year ended december  from an expense of million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in the market value of trading securities in as compared to consistent with the performance of overall markets  significant losses were experienced in the fourth quarter of and gains were experienced in the second and third quarters of  resulting in the large swing from a loss in to a gain in interest expense  net year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest expense is attributable primarily to our long term debt and is reported net of interest and dividend income earned on cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower interest rate in compared to as a result of our debt refinancing during the third quarter of each of these years 
the effective interest rate of the company s outstanding 
table of contents long term debt  inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing costs  was as of december  as compared to as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to a lower average outstanding debt balance in the effective interest rate of the company s outstanding long term debt  inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing costs  was as of december  income tax expense benefit year ended december  compared to year ended december  our income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to a million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense is primarily attributable to increased taxable income in certain state jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  although in the company generated a pre tax loss for the year ended december   tax expenses were recorded in certain state jurisdictions 
in  the benefit of the tax loss generated was partially offset by an million increase in our valuation allowance 
upon completion of the spin off on december   in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the company believed  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized because certain potential tax planning strategies available to our former parent company will no longer be available to the company 
preferred stockholder dividends on march   the board of directors of the company declared cash dividends on its series b convertible preferred stock for the three month period ended december  of million  which the company paid on march  on may   the board of directors of the company declared cash dividends on its series b convertible preferred stock for the three month period ended march  of million  which the company paid on july  on july   the board of directors of the company declared cash dividends on its series b convertible preferred stock for the three month period ended june  of million  of which the company paid million on august  related to the  convertible preferred shares that were converted into common shares on the same date and million on september  related to the remaining  outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock

working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
capital requirements our short term capital requirements  which we consider to be those capital requirements due within one year  include payment of interest on our credit facility  payment of annual incentive compensation and payment of preferred stock dividends 
upon the conversion of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock in august  the company reduced its annual dividend payment requirement on its convertible preferred stock by million to million 
during the year ended december   the company paid million of preferred stock dividends 
incentive compensation  which is generally the company s largest annual operating cash payment  is paid in the first quarter of the year 
the company expects to pay approximately million in incentive compensation in the first quarter of related to incentives that were earned during the year ended december  the company paid approximately million in incentive compensation in the first quarter of related to incentives that were earned during the year ended december  long term capital requirements could include seed money for new products  principal payments on our outstanding credit facility  which matures in september  and purchases of shares of our common stock  infrastructure improvements and other strategic and operating initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a share repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
under the terms of the program the company may repurchase its common stock from time to time in its discretion through open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions  depending on price and prevailing market and business conditions 
the program is intended to return capital to shareholders and to generally offset shares issued under equity based plans 
the program may be suspended or terminated at any time and the authorization for the program expires three years from inception 
as of december   the company has repurchased a total of  common shares for million and has  shares remaining authorized for repurchase 

table of contents during the first quarter of  the company has repurchased a total of  common shares for million and has  shares remaining for repurchase as of february  we anticipate that our available cash  marketable securities and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected cash operating requirements and other capital requirements in the short term  which we consider to be the next twelve months 
our ability to meet our future cash needs will depend upon our future operating performance and the level and mix of assets under management  as well as general economic conditions 
current or unexpected events that could require additional liquidity may occur affecting our results of operations  access to financing and generation of cash 
if such events were to occur  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reductions in related variable expenses  primarily incentive compensation and distribution costs 
however there can be no assurance that these actions alone would be sufficient to compensate for a significant reduction in income from operations 
the financial markets have experienced a period of significant volatility over the past three years  which impacted asset outflows and the value of our assets under management 
the capital and financial markets could experience further fluctuation and volatility  which could impact relative investment returns and asset flows among investment products as well as investor choices and preferences among investment products  including equity  fixed income and alternative products 
should assets under management decline for any reason  revenues  operating income  net income and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses  our net income will be reduced 
capital and reserve requirements we have a subsidiary that is a broker dealer registered with the sec and is therefore subject to certain rules regarding minimum net capital  as defined by those rules 
the subsidiary is required to maintain a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital  as defined  which may not exceed to and must also maintain a minimum amount of net capital 
failure to meet these requirements could result in adverse consequences to us including additional reporting requirements  tighter ratios and business interruption 
at december  and  the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital of the broker dealer was below the maximum allowed and our net capital was significantly in excess of that required 
balance sheet cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid affiliated and unaffiliated money market mutual fund investments

net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  increased by million from million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  although our operating expenses have also declined with revenue  certain of our overhead and other costs are not variable in the short term and take a longer period of time to reduce relative to the decrease in revenues  resulting in less cash flow being generated

impact of new accounting standards for a discussion of accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates 
actual results will vary from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill as of december   the carrying amount of goodwill was million 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of identified net assets and liabilities acquired 
for goodwill  impairment tests for the company are performed annually  or more frequently  should circumstances change which would indicate the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   we estimated fair value based on consideration of several valuation techniques  which included i market based multiple model  ii discounted cash flow model and iii market capitalization 
for the year ended december   there were no goodwill impairments as the estimated fair value of goodwill was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
consistent with the overall market conditions in  with the s p up approximately for the year ended december   there were improvements in key valuation assumptions used in management s valuation as compared to the prior year 
key assumptions included in our valuation included a discount rate of  an average long term growth rate of  average operating margins of  and an average revenue multiple of x revenues 
a change in the key assumptions used would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
no impairment had been identified or recorded by the company for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded total goodwill impairments of million as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines and a marked decrease in credit market liquidity 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of indefinite lived intangible assets were million 
indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired  closed end fund investment advisory contracts 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently should circumstances change which would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the company estimated fair value of intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
management believes a discounted cash flow analysis is most appropriate in valuing the indefinite lived intangible assets because it has concluded that it is a likely method that would be utilized by market participants 
the key variables impacting the valuation of the intangible assets under this model include the discount rate and assets under management related to the relevant investment advisory contracts 
for the year ended december   there were no indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
consistent with the overall market conditions in  with the s p up approximately for the year ended december   there were improvements in key valuation assumptions used in management s valuation as compared to the prior year 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   the discount rate applied in the calculation used by the company was  based on an estimated cost of capital that reflects the current economic conditions 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would not result in an impairment charge 
a decrease in assets under management underlying these investment advisory contracts would not result in an impairment charge 
no impairment had been identified or recorded by the company for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recorded a million impairment charge as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines  and a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 

table of contents definite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of definite lived intangible assets were million 
definite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired investment advisory contracts 
the company monitors the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets and revises the useful lives  if necessary  based on the circumstances 
significant judgment is required in estimating the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on our amortization expense 
all amortization expense has been  and continues to be  calculated on a straight line basis 
for definite lived intangible assets  impairment testing is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the company determines the carrying value of the definite lived intangible assets is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset we will quantify the impairment using a discounted cash flow model 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset  discount rate  investment management fee rates on assets under management  and market expense ratio factor 
during the years ended december  and  no events or circumstances occurred that indicated the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets might be impaired and therefore no impairment tests were performed during these periods 
during the year ended december   the company recorded definite lived intangible assets impairment charges totaling million 
an interim test was triggered by management s assessment that declines in assets and revenue supporting the advisory contracts coupled with a notice of termination from one large account required such a test 
other impairment tests were performed as the result of management s assessment that the carrying amount of the definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable as a result of changes in the market environment  primarily driven by equity market declines 
other contributors to the assessment were a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
revenue recognition investment management fees  distribution and service fees and administration and transfer agent fees are recorded as income during the period in which services are performed 
investment management fees  which are accrued monthly  are earned based upon a percentage of assets under management  and are paid pursuant to the terms of the respective investment management contracts  which generally require monthly or quarterly payment 
management fees for structured finance products  such as clos and cdos  that accrue as services are rendered  but are subordinated to other interests and payable only if certain financial criteria of the underlying collateral are met  are recorded as income when the structured finance products are in compliance with required financial criteria and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for investment management fees in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  and has recorded its management fees net of fees paid to unaffiliated advisors 
amounts paid to unaffiliated sub advisors for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
investment management fees are calculated based on our assets under management 
we rely on data provided to us by mutual funds and custodians in the pricing of assets under management  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
the boards of our mutual funds and management of custodians of the assets we manage have formal 
table of contents pricing policies and procedures over pricing of investments 
given our reliance on the data provided to us by the mutual funds and the custodians in the pricing of the assets under management  management has established internal procedures to corroborate that mutual fund and custodial pricing appears adequate and has implemented processes to ensure valuation discrepancies are investigated and resolved 
distribution and service fees are earned based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid monthly pursuant to the terms of the respective distribution and service fee contracts 
underwriter fees are sales based charges on sales of certain class a share mutual funds 
administration and transfer agent fees consist of fund administration fees  transfer agent fees and fiduciary fees 
fund administration fees are earned based on the average daily assets in the funds 
transfer agent fees are earned based on the average daily assets in the funds 
fiduciary fees are recorded monthly based on the number of k accounts 
the company utilizes outside service providers to perform some of the functions related to fund administration and transfer agent services 
effective january   a new fund administration agreement was executed with our open end mutual funds 
under the prior agreement  the fees  which covered all fund administration services  were paid directly to the company by the funds and were recorded as revenue 
a portion of the fees received by the company were remitted to third party service providers for services performed on behalf of the funds  and were recorded as a distribution and administration expense 
as a result of the new agreement  the funds now directly contract for the third party services and fees paid by the funds directly to the service providers are not reflected as either revenue or expenses of the company 
for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of payments to third party service providers were recorded as revenue and expense of the company 
for the years ended december  and transfer agent fees  which were previously reported net of payments to third party service providers  were million and million  respectively 
other income and fees consist primarily of redemption income on the early redemption of class b share mutual funds and brokerage commissions and fees earned for the distribution of nonaffiliated products 
commissions earned and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis and are computed based upon contractual agreements 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we concluded that a valuation allowance on substantially all of the company s deferred tax assets at december  is required 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our operations and consideration of available tax planning strategies and actions that would be implemented by us  if necessary  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of carry forwards related to net operating losses and capital losses 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with demonstrated operating results 
the projection also includes consideration of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities that are in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets

changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for a capital loss in the amount of million related to the dissolution of one of its inactive  wholly owned subsidiaries 
the company is in the process of submitting a private letter ruling plr request to the internal revenue service related to the application of internal revenue code section g which may allow the capital loss to be claimed as an ordinary loss in the company s federal income tax return 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in obtaining this plr 
prior to december   the company had historically been included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by pnx and was a party to a tax sharing agreement by and among pnx and its subsidiaries 
in accordance with this 
table of contents agreement  federal income taxes for the year ended december  was allocated as if they had been calculated on a separate company basis  except that benefits for any net operating loss were provided to the extent such loss was utilized in the consolidated federal tax return 
deferred tax assets and or liabilities were determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences were recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates was recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
the tax separation agreement the agreement between virtus and pnx as of december   as amended on april   required pnx to make certain elections and waivers 
the agreement provided for a waiver of tax basis by pnx in an amount that was necessary to preserve i the deferred tax assets of million deferred tax assets reported as of december   which under generally accepted accounting principles  represents temporary differences and is recorded in the financial statements and ii tax basis in stock of subsidiary entities which  under generally accepted accounting principles  is not recorded in the financial statements 
in september  our former parent company filed its consolidated federal income tax return  which included virtus as a majority owned subsidiary 
in its federal income tax filing  pnx provided a waiver of tax basis sufficient to preserve the company s tax basis in intangible assets 
the waiver and elections made by pnx and included in their tax return were contemplated and reflected in the company s deferred tax assets reported as of december  based on our review of the information filed in the tax return  there were no significant changes in previously reported deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance have been adjusted  as necessary with no net impact to the company s income tax expense  to reflect changes in estimates that were identified based on the return filed by our former parent company 
uncertain tax positions taken by the company are accounted for under asc  income taxes  which may require certain benefits taken on a tax return to not be recognized in the financial statements when there is the potential for certain tax positions to be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
loss contingencies the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated using the criteria of asc  loss contingencies  and an accrued liability is recorded if the likelihood of a loss is considered both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our reasonable estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisor for the funds and accounts we manage as investment advisor 
most of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from investment management  distribution and fund administration fees  which are typically based on the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the market value of our investments  consisting primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of marketable securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the fair value of marketable securities at december   our net income would change by million and our total comprehensive income would change by million for the year ended december  interest rate risk at december   the company has million outstanding under the credit facility that has a variable interest rate 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor for interest periods of   or months or an alternate base rate  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
at december   the interest rate in effect for the credit facility was 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the year ended december  would have changed our interest expense by approximately million
