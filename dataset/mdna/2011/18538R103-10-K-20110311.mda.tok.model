risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  and as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the expansion of our business through the acquisition of cellu tissue  other potential acquisitions and construction of new paper making and converting facilities may not proceed as anticipated 
our long term growth strategy involves expanding our consumer products segment in both size and geographic reach 
in december  we acquired cellu tissue  which operates manufacturing and converting facilities primarily located on the east coast and midwest 
concurrently with our integration of cellu tissue  we are building a new tad paper machine and converting facilities in shelby  north carolina 
in the future  we may build other converting and papermaking facilities  pursue acquisitions of existing facilities  or both 
building new  or acquiring and modifying existing  manufacturing facilities entails numerous risks  including difficulties in completing such projects on time due to construction and permitting issues  financing the project  completing the project within budget and integrating new operations and personnel 
for example  the facilities under construction in shelby  north carolina  are highly complex and costly and the paper machine can be manufactured by only a few companies in the world 
as a result  the purchase and installation of this paper machine would be delayed in the event the manufacturer is not able to meet our timelines  and we do not expect that we would be able to find a replacement without significant additional cost and delay 
we may be unable to identify future suitable building locations or acquisition targets 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate  or at all 
any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner  any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash  an increase in our indebtedness  or both  and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of cellu tissue because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue  earnings or operating efficiency that each of clearwater paper and cellu tissue had achieved or might have achieved separately 
in addition  the success of the acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition  including anticipated synergies and costs savings 
the integration process will be complex  costly and time consuming 
the potential risks associated with our efforts to integrate the operations of cellu tissue s business include  among others failure to implement effectively our business plan for the combined business  unanticipated issues in integrating financial  manufacturing  logistics  information  communications and other systems  failure to retain key employees  failure to retain key customers  inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  including internal control and regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  and unanticipated issues  expenses and liabilities 
further  the integration of the cellu tissue businesses requires the focused attention of our management team  including a significant commitment of their time and resources 
the need for our management to focus on integration matters could have a material and adverse impact on our sales and operating results

table of contents changes in the cost and availability of wood fiber used in production of our products may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
wood fiber  primarily wood chips and sawdust  is the principal raw material used in our pulp and paperboard products and the manufacturing of our consumer products 
pulp is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of wood fiber markets 
the average per ton price of pulp purchased by our consumer products segment  excluding cellu tissue  was approximately higher in compared to increases in pulp prices could adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trail the increases in pulp prices 
we have not hedged to manage these risks 
our consumer products segment has historically sourced a portion of its wood pulp supply from our pulp and paperboard segment  while the cellu tissue operations we acquired have historically relied entirely on external suppliers for wood pulp 
consequently  we will have a much greater percentage of our total wood pulp requirements sourced from external suppliers  creating greater exposure to fluctuations in prices for wood pulp 
much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process is the by product of lumber mill operations  particularly in lewiston  idaho 
as a result  the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry 
the significant reduction in home building over the past three years resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many lumber mills 
the price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile until the housing market recovers and lumber mill operations increase 
additionally  the supply and price of wood fiber can be negatively affected by weather and other events 
the effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations 
if we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all  our results and operations may be materially adversely affected 
increases in our transportation costs or disruptions in our transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business  particularly our consumer products business  is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us 
in  our transportation costs were of our cost of sales 
the costs of these transportation services are affected by the volatility in fuel prices  such as those caused by recent geopolitical and economic events 
we have not been in the past  and may not be in the future  able to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers 
if we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers  our gross margins may be materially adversely affected 
if any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis 
shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions  strikes or other events 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation  negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our business 
we use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes  including latex and polyethylene  many of which are petroleum based chemicals 
prices of chemicals that we purchase were approximately higher in compared to prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile 
in addition  chemical suppliers that use petroleum based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may  due to supply shortages and cost increases  ration the amount of chemicals available to us  and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business  if we are able to obtain them at all 
further  certain specialty chemicals that we purchase are available only from a small number of suppliers 
if any of these suppliers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to obtain such chemicals at favorable prices  if at all 

table of contents our manufacturing operations utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
energy costs were of our cost of sales in  or million 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade  which in turn affects cost of sales 
our energy expenses were lower in than in we purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand  geopolitical events  government regulation  and natural disasters 
to help mitigate the exposure to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  we have used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements 
we have also taken steps to reduce our energy usage through conservation and increasing our internal energy production at our lewiston  idaho cogeneration facility  as has cellu tissue at its menominee  michigan and east hartford  connecticut cogeneration facilities 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
changes in demand for certain products could adversely affect our financial results 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to adjust to increases and decreases in demand 
if we are unable to respond to increases in demand  we may need to limit deliveries of some orders for existing customers  which could harm our reputation and our long term relationships with these customers 
currently  we are unable to meet all of the demand from existing and potential customers for bathroom tissue due to very high demand 
alternatively  if we experience a decrease in demand for certain products  we may incur significant costs in revising our manufacturing plan 
if we are not able to respond to changes in demand for our products in a timely manner  our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 
branded products and increased competition over tad products could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our consumer products compete with well known  branded products  as well as other private label products 
inherent risks in our competitive strategy include whether our products will receive direct and retail customer acceptance  new product offerings by competitors  the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels  and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  some of our private label competitors have built or announced plans to build new papermaking facilities that will produce tad paper used to produce high end consumer products that compete with high end branded products 
we currently produce tad paper used for paper towels at only two facilities  las vegas and the recently acquired cellu tissue st 
catharine s  ontario facility  and we currently do not produce tad bathroom tissue 
if we are unable to offer our existing customers  or new customers  comparable consumer products and in sufficient quantities  we may lose business  not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower margin products  all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
cyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flow of our pulp and paperboard business 
our pulp and paperboard business is particularly affected by cyclical market conditions 
we may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand  and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime 
in addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes  production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels 
our results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness 
we are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders from  or changes in prices in regards to  any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in  excluding cellu tissue  our consumer products segment derived approximately of its net sales  and we derived approximately of our total net sales  from the kroger company and two other customers 
the kroger company accounted for of our total net sales in each of and sales to these three customers have represented nearly of segment net sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
we have experienced increased price and promotion competition for our consumer products customers  which can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our financial condition 
some of the cellu tissue customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products themselves that they previously purchased from cellu tissue 
our pulp and paperboard segment sells its products to a large number of customers  although certain customers have historically purchased a significant amount of our pulp or paperboard products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them 
in addition  our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments 
our relationship with our large customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products at competitive prices 
if we lose one of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them  we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed 
in addition  our focus on these large accounts could affect our ability to serve our smaller accounts  particularly when product supply is tight and we are not able to fully satisfy orders for these smaller accounts 
we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers for certain raw materials required for the production of our products 
furthermore  in some cases we rely on a single supplier 
our dependence on a limited number of third party suppliers or on a single supplier  and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials  involve several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality  and delivery schedules 
we cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements 
any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be identified and qualified 
although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials  we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms 
any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could interrupt production of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
united states and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results 
us and global economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results 
in particular  the away from home consumer paper products market has experienced a decline because of the slowdown in the travel and restaurant industries as a result of the current economic downturn 
recessed economic conditions affect our business in a number of ways  including causing i increased pressure for price concessions from customers  ii declines in domestic and global demand for paperboard  iii shifts in customer purchases that affect the mix of our product sales  iv decreased or low housing starts  which increase production costs due to lower wood fiber supplies and extend the slump in demand for our wood products  and v financial distress or insolvency for certain customers which could affect our sales volumes or our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from those customers 
larger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations 
the markets for our products are highly competitive  and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market 
some of our competitors will have advantages over us  including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products 

table of contents our consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products 
our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers  such as procter gamble  and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products  such as georgia pacific and kimberly clark 
these companies are far larger than us  have much greater sales  marketing and research and development resources than we do  and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale 
historically  pure branded tissue producers have not produced private label tissue products 
the greater scope and scale of operations enjoyed at our major consumer products competitors would allow them to produce greater quantities of private label tissue at lower costs than we incur 
in addition  because of their size and resources  these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete 
our ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors  including manufacturing capacity  general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes 
our pulp and paperboard business competes with international paper  meadwestvaco  georgia pacific  rocktenn and international producers  most of whom are much larger than us 
any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry  which could cause downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials  such as plastic  for their products 
an increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our qualification to retain  or ability to utilize  tax credits associated with alternative fuels or cellulosic biofuels and the tax treatment associated with receipt of such credits are uncertain 
in  we received refundable tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit was equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
this tax credit expired on december  in  we recorded income of million related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc 
we did not record any income in relating to the afmtc 
there is relatively little guidance regarding the afmtc and the law governing the issue is complex 
accordingly  there remains uncertainty as to our qualification to receive the tax credit in  as well as to whether we will be entitled to retain the amounts we received upon further review by the irs 
in addition  while it is our position that payments received or credits taken in relation to the afmtc should not be subject to corporate income tax  there can be no assurance as to whether or not the amounts we have received will be subject to taxation 
we are also registered with the internal revenue service  or irs  as a cellulosic biofuel producer  which enables us to claim the per gallon cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  in regards to black liquor produced and used as a fuel by us at our pulp mills in we have changed  and may in the future make additional changes in  our position as to some or all of the credits we claimed under the afmtc on our federal income tax form  provided we believe we will have sufficient future federal taxable earnings to enable us to carry forward the credits potentially available under the cbpc 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the cbpc 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
approximately of our full time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements 
as these agreements expire  we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us 
we currently have five collective bargaining agreements under negotiation 
any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes  lockouts or other labor actions 
any such labor actions  including work slowdowns or stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results

table of contents we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures  which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  water discharges  air emissions  hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup 
environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
increased regulatory activity at the state  federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites 
compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part 
we are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes 
federal  state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities  which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits 
failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures  install pollution control equipment  or take other remedial actions  product recalls or labeling changes 
we also may be required to make additional expenditures  which could be significant  relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis 
we own properties  conduct or have conducted operations at properties  and have assumed indemnity obligations in connection with our spin off from potlatch for properties or operations  where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years  including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary 
consequently  we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities 
the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis 
we must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in addition  our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance 
these scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which the shutdown occurs 
unexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities 
for example  we curtailed operations at our lewiston pulp and paperboard facility in early as the result of a blow tank collapse and curtailed operations at our wiggins  mississippi consumer products facility in early as the result of a fire 
disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances  including prolonged power outages  mechanical or process failures  shortages of raw materials  natural catastrophes  disruptions in the availability of transportation  labor disputes  terrorism  changes in or non compliance with environmental or safety laws and the lack of availability of services from any of our facility s key sole suppliers 
any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods  regardless of the reason for the shutdown 
those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks  depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our wood products business  which is part of our pulp and paperboard segment  is highly sensitive to downturns in the housing market 
our wood products business is a commodity business  which is closely tied to the demand for  and supply of  housing 
the home building industry is influenced by numerous factors  including economic changes nationally and locally  mortgage and other interest rates  consumer confidence  job formation  demographic trends  tax incentives  and the availability of credit 
the current depressed conditions in the housing market resulting from  among other factors  excess unsold home inventory levels and lack of availability of credit for lenders  builders and homebuyers  have materially adversely affected our wood products business 
a continuing and prolonged downturn in the housing market could have a significant adverse effect on the future results of operations of our pulp and paperboard segment 
our pension plans are currently underfunded  and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans  reducing cash available for our business 
we have company sponsored pension plans covering our salaried and hourly employees 
the significant decline in the securities markets beginning in and resulting substantial decline in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by the plans caused these pension plans to be underfunded because our projected benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
as a result  we are required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans 
in  we contributed million to these pension plans  which covered all of our and tax year requirements as well as made an additional million voluntary contribution 
the required cash contribution to our qualified pension plans for is expected to be approximately million plus interest payable by september and we expect to be required to contribute approximately million plus interest payable by september we may be required to make increased annual contributions to our pension plans in future years  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change 
in addition to our pension plans  we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our current and former us salaried and hourly employees 
our retiree health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally  which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years 
our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension costs 
significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations  and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition 
we use information technology  or it  systems in various aspects of our operations  including enterprise resource planning  management of inventories and customer sales 
some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time 
additionally  with the acquisition of cellu tissue  we have different legacy it systems which we need to integrate 
if one of these systems was to fail  or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems  we may suffer disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of cellu tissue  which could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
in order to finance the acquisition of cellu tissue  we incurred debt of million through the sale of notes  and assumed approximately million of existing debt issued by a subsidiary of cellu tissue 
additionally  clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents we have outstanding indebtedness of million under notes we issued in these substantial debt obligations could have important consequences to our business 
for example we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our substantial debt service obligations  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  including business development efforts  capital expenditures or strategic acquisitions  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry may be limited  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our future operations 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  if we cannot service our indebtedness  we may have to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances  any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business 
we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the indentures for our notes  and our senior secured revolving credit facility  contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and our failure to comply could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated 
the indentures governing the notes we issued in and  and our senior secured revolving credit facility contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to undergo a change in control  sell assets  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  create liens  consolidate  merge  or sell substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  engage in new lines of business  and enter into sale and lease back transactions 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our discretion could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities 
in addition  our senior secured revolving credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to when availability falls below million or an event of default exists 
events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet this financial test 
if we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our notes  our secured revolving credit facility or other debt instruments  an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur 
if an event of default does occur  it could trigger a cross default under our other debt instruments  prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings  and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable 
our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt 
even if we were able to secure additional financing  it may not be available on favorable terms

table of contents on december   we acquired cellu tissue holdings  inc  or cellu tissue 
the results discussed below include cellu tissue operating results for the period december  through december  highlights acquisition of cellu tissue holdings  inc on december   we completed our acquisition of cellu tissue for million in cash 
in connection with the acquisition of cellu tissue  we retired cellu tissue s outstanding senior secured notes for million and repaid million outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
the cellu tissue operations include nine consumer products manufacturing facilities located in the southern  midwestern and eastern united states and one site in canada 
cellu tissue reported million in net sales for the fiscal year ended february  we believe the acquisition allows us to better serve existing private label grocery customers by creating a national manufacturing footprint and provides us with the capability to expand into new private label channels 
notes offering on october   we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes  which we refer to as the notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to finance in part our acquisition of cellu tissue  to refinance certain existing indebtedness of cellu tissue  and to pay fees and expenses incurred as part of the cellu tissue acquisition 
the notes mature on november   and have an interest rate of payable semi annually in arrears on may and november  commencing on may  the notes are guaranteed by certain of our existing and future domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries 
cellulosic biofuel producer credit we are registered with the internal revenue service  or irs  as both an alternative fuel mixer and a producer of cellulosic biofuel 
during we received refundable tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit is equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc  expired on december  the cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  enables us to claim per gallon in regards to black liquor produced and used as a fuel by us at our pulp mills in during  the irs issued guidance clarifying the treatment of the cbpc and the afmtc in regards to the production or use of black liquor at the same facility  in the same tax year 
under the guidance provided  both credits may be claimed in the same year as long as the credits are not claimed for the same gallons of fuel 
furthermore  the irs guidance made it clear we could convert previously claimed gallons from the afmtc to the cbpc 
we have amended our corporate income tax return and claimed approximately million gallons of fuel under the cbpc for that portion of black liquor produced in for which we did not claim the afmtc 
this equated to an additional federal income tax credit of million  which was recognized in the fourth quarter of additionally  we are amending our corporate income tax return to convert approximately million gallons of fuel under the afmtc to the cbpc 
this equated to an additional federal income tax credit of million  which was recognized in the fourth quarter of the cbpc is a non refundable income tax credit which is deemed to be taxable income in the year the benefit is received 
thus the cbpc benefit was reduced by the related corporate income tax obligation  resulting in an incremental  after tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter of  which is included in the income tax provision on our consolidated statements of operations 
consumer products expansion in shelby  north carolina in june  we announced our decision to build new tissue manufacturing and converting facilities in shelby  north carolina as part of our plans to expand our consumer products segment in the eastern united states 
this site will include a through air dried  or tad  paper machine and is currently expected to have seven 
table of contents converting lines capable of producing ultra grades of private label tissue products 
we have estimated the project will cost approximately million 
we incurred million of project costs in and expect to incur an additional million in substantially all of the remaining amounts are expected to be spent in business clearwater paper corporation is a leading producer of private label tissue and paperboard products 
our products are primarily pulp based and manufactured in the united states 
as of december   our business was organized into two reporting segments our consumer products segment manufactures tissue products sold on a private label basis primarily to major grocery store chains  and as a result of the cellu tissue acquisition  leading discount and mass merchant retailers and away from home distributors 
prior to the acquisition of cellu tissue  we operated two tissue mills with related converting facilities in idaho and nevada  and an additional converting facility located in illinois 
as a result of the cellu tissue acquisition  we now have additional manufacturing and converting facilities in connecticut  georgia  michigan  mississippi  new york  wisconsin  oklahoma  and ontario  canada 
the segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our net sales  before elimination of intersegment net sales 
intersegment net sales were million in our segment net sales include cellu tissue net sales of million from december  through december  our pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard and bleached softwood pulp 
commencing january   our wood products operation  which produces dimensional framing lumber and appearance grade cedar products at our mill in idaho  was consolidated into the pulp and paperboard segment 
we operate two pulp and paperboard mills  one located in arkansas and one in idaho 
in  approximately of our pulp production was used in the manufacture of our paperboard products or transferred to our consumer products segment for use in the production of tissue products 
the segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our net sales  before elimination of intersegment net sales 
intersegment net sales  consisting of the sale of pulp to our consumer products segment  were million in developments and trends in our business our operating results have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors  including the cyclical nature of the pulp and paperboard industry  competition  the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing operations  changes in our principal expenses such as for wood fiber and energy  and other factors 
net sales prices for our consumer tissue products are affected by competitive conditions and the prices of branded tissue products 
demand and pricing for our pulp and paperboard products are largely determined by general global market conditions 
market conditions for pulp improved significantly during sales price realization for pulp for increased compared to due to continued strong pulp pricing partly as result of a pulp shortage attributable to the decrease in south american pulp production following the earthquake in chile in february paperboard prices improved in compared to prior years 
demand for our wood products is largely related to the us housing market  which continues to be in a prolonged downturn 
our businesses experience cyclical market conditions and  as a result  historical prices for our products and sales volumes have been volatile 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand for our products 
product supply in the industries in which we operate is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
capacity in these industries tends to increase during periods when prices remain strong 
in addition  currency exchange rates affect us supplies of paperboard  as us manufacturers are attracted to the us market when the dollar is relatively strong 
our paperboard business  through exports  has benefited significantly from weakness in the us dollar over the past few years 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents demand for our paperboard products is related to the state of the north american economy in general  as well as  in the case of our paperboard products  the economies of east asia 
the demand for our wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  home repair and remodeling activity  which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  interest rates  population growth and other factors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our markets 
in addition  our industry is capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs  large capital outlays and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition  particularly during periods of reduced demand 
some of our competitors have lower production costs  greater buying power and  as a result  these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases 
net sales consist of sales of consumer tissue  pulp and paperboard and wood products  net of discounts  returns and allowances and any sales taxes collected 
sales taxes  when collected  are recorded as a current liability until remitted to the appropriate governmental entities 
operating costs year ended december  dollars in thousands cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales wood fiber chemicals transportation energy maintenance and repairs excluding intersegment amounts 
excluding related labor costs 
our principal operating cost items are wood fiber  chemicals  transportation  energy and maintenance and repairs 
prices for these items are volatile and directly affect our results of operations 
in  the price of pulp increased significantly compared to partially attributable to a temporary imbalance in global pulp markets resulting from the chilean earthquake 
as economic conditions continue to improve  we expect at least some upward pressure on these operating costs 
competitive market conditions can limit our ability to pass cost increases through to our customers 
wood fiber 
we are a large net buyer of pulp and as a result of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we have become a significantly larger net buyer 
we have supply agreements with various pulp suppliers covering under which we expect to purchase approximately of our anticipated pulp requirements in these supply agreements permit us to purchase pulp at prices that are discounted from published list prices 
as a larger net buyer of pulp  we expect to obtain more favorable pulp pricing in the future 
the balance of our pulp requirements is produced internally and purchased on the spot market 
our most significant operating cost is the cost of wood fiber needed to supply our manufacturing facilities 
both wood chips and sawdust are used in the process of making pulp 
we rely on residual wood fibers  such as wood chips and sawdust generated by lumber mill operations and wood chips specifically produced for us by contract wood chipping operations 
prices for this wood fiber can fluctuate greatly 
overall lumber production in idaho increased in compared to  creating more residual chips and sawdust and decreasing the dependency on higher priced whole log chips 
in  we acquired a significant portion of our wood fiber requirements from potlatch under agreements entered into at the time of spin off  with the remainder purchased from other suppliers pursuant to short term contracts and in the spot market 
chemicals 
we consume a significant amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paperboard 
important chemicals we use include polyethylene  caustic  starch  sodium chlorate  latex and specialty paper process chemicals 
many of our chemicals are purchased under long term contracts  which provide more 
table of contents stability than open market purchases 
however  many of these contracts have pricing mechanisms that adjust with published price indices 
in addition  many of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  particularly in the pulp making process  are petroleum based and impacted by petroleum prices 
transportation 
petroleum prices also impact our operating results 
high fuel prices result in increased transportation costs related to delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities  internal inventory transfers and delivery of our finished products to customers 
rising fuel prices particularly affect our margins for consumer products because we supply customers throughout the united states and we transport unconverted parent rolls from our tissue mills to our tissue converting facilities 
energy 
energy is another significant manufacturing cost 
we use energy in the form of electricity  hog fuel  steam and natural gas 
the cellu tissue operations also use a minimal amount of coal 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade 
in  excluding cellu tissue  we experienced lower energy costs than in we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices through conservation and by increasing our internal electrical production at our cogeneration facility that produces steam and electricity in idaho 
in addition  to help mitigate our exposure to volatility in natural gas prices  we have used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements 
however  as of december   these contracts only covered approximately of our expected average monthly natural gas requirements for as we expect the near term natural gas markets to be more stable given recent supply that has and is expected to become available 
prior to being acquired  cellu tissue had developed initiatives to reduce energy costs  including a third party steam project at the wiggins  mississippi plant to replace a portion of its natural gas fired steam generation and cogeneration facilities at the east hartford  connecticut and menominee  michigan facilities to reduce electrical consumption 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
maintenance and repairs 
we regularly incur significant costs to maintain our manufacturing equipment 
the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and most are run on a continuous basis 
we perform routine maintenance on our machines and periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in  equipment maintenance and repair expenses  excluding labor costs and cellu tissue operations  were million in our consumer products segment and million in our pulp and paperboard segment 
major equipment maintenance and repair in our pulp and paperboard segment also requires maintenance shutdowns generally lasting up to one week per year at our idaho facility and up to one week approximately every months at our arkansas facility  which increases costs and may reduce net sales in the quarters in which the maintenance shutdowns occur 
periodically  major equipment shutdowns extend beyond one week in duration for large scale maintenance  such as extensive boiler repairs 
major maintenance and repair costs for are expected to be approximately million  with million of these costs expected to be incurred in the first quarter 
in addition to ongoing maintenance and repair costs  we make capital expenditures to add capacity  increase our operating efficiency  for safety reasons and to comply with environmental laws 
in  excluding million spent on our north carolina expansion  we spent million on capital expenditures 
our estimated capital expenditures for are expected to be million  including an estimated million for our north carolina expansion 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million primarily consist of compensation and associated costs for sales and administrative personnel  as well as commission expenses related to sales of our products 
in the short term  we expect our selling  general and administrative costs to increase as we integrate cellu tissue into our administrative functions 
interest expense 
interest expense is generally comprised of interest on our million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes  or notes  issued by us in june  our notes issued by us in october and any outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility 
interest expense also includes clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents amortization of deferred finance costs associated with our notes  notes and credit facility and capital lease amounts 
as part of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we also assumed million of industrial revenue bonds  or irbs  associated with the facility in ladysmith  wisconsin 
we expect future gross interest expense to increase significantly as a result of a full year of interest expense on the notes and to a smaller extent the irbs 
interest expense will be partially offset by the capitalization of interest during the construction phase of our north carolina papermaking and converting facilities 
income taxes 
income taxes are based on reported earnings and tax rates in the jurisdictions in which our operations occur and offices are located  adjusted for available credits  changes in valuation allowances and differences between reported earnings and taxable income using current tax laws and enacted tax rates 
in  our effective rate was 
excluding the benefits of the cbpc and afmtc  the effective tax rate was for the estimated annual effective tax rate for  excluding discrete items  is approximately 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements in item long lived assets 
a significant portion of our total assets are invested in our manufacturing facilities 
also  the cyclical patterns of our businesses cause cash flows to fluctuate by varying degrees from period to period 
as a result  long lived assets are a material component of our financial position with the potential for material change in valuation if assets are determined to be impaired 
we account for impairment of long lived assets in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  regarding impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  as measured by its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
we use our operational budgets to estimate future cash flows 
budgets are inherently uncertain estimates of future performance due to the fact that all inputs  including net sales  costs and capital spending  are subject to frequent change for many different reasons 
because of the number of variables involved  the interrelationship between the variables and the long term nature of the impairment measurement  sensitivity analysis of individual variables is not practical 
budget estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changing business conditions  and operations are reviewed  as appropriate  for impairment using the most current data available 
we believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of all of our assets based on anticipated cash flows that will result from our estimates of future demand  pricing  and production costs  assuming certain levels of capital expenditures 
pension and postretirement employee benefits 
the determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the rate of return on plan assets 
for other postretirement employee benefit  or opeb  plans  which provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees  critical assumptions in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations 

table of contents note to our consolidated financial statements includes information for the three years ended december   and  on the components of pension and opeb expense and the underlying actuarial assumptions used to calculate periodic expense  as well as the funded status for our pension and opeb plans as of december  and the discount rate used in the determination of pension benefit obligations and pension expense is determined based on a review of long term high grade bonds and management s expectations 
at december   we calculated obligations using a discount rate 
the discount rates used at december  and were and  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension assets  we employ a process that analyzes historical long term returns for various investment categories  as measured by appropriate indices 
these indices are weighted based upon the extent to which plan assets are invested in the particular categories in arriving at our determination of a composite expected return 
the long term rates of return used at december    and were  and  respectively 
total periodic pension plan expense in was million 
an increase in the discount rate or the rate of expected return on plan assets  all other assumptions remaining the same  would decrease pension plan expense  and conversely  a decrease in either of these measures would increase plan expense 
as an indication of the sensitivity that pension expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumption for expected return on plan assets would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
the actual rates of return on plan assets may vary significantly from the assumptions used because of unanticipated changes in financial markets 
our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded by million at december  compared to million at december  as a result of the underfunded status  we are required to make estimated contributions of million plus interest to our qualified pension plans for the plan year  payable by september approximately million of these contributions are required to be paid in  with the remainder not required until in addition  we estimate contributions will total approximately million in to our non qualified pension plan 
we do not anticipate funding our opeb plans in except to pay benefit costs as incurred during the year by plan participants 
for our opeb plans  expense for was million 
the discount rate used to calculate opeb obligations  which was determined using the same methodology we used for our pension plans  was  and at december   and  respectively 
the assumed health care cost trend rates used to calculate opeb obligations and expense was and  respectively  in  grading to over approximately years 
as an indication of the sensitivity that opeb expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect plan expense by approximately million 
a change in the assumption for health care cost trend rates would have affected plan expense by approximately to million and the total postretirement employee obligation by approximately to million 
the actual rates of health care cost increases may vary significantly from the assumption used because of unanticipated changes in health care costs 
periodic pension and opeb expenses are included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expense is allocated to all business segments 
in accordance with current accounting guidance governing defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  at december  and  long term assets are recorded for overfunded plans and liabilities are recorded for underfunded plans 
the funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation 
for underfunded plans  the estimated liability to be payable in the next twelve months is recorded as a current liability  with the remaining portion recorded as a long term liability 
effective december   the salaried pension plan was frozen to new entrants and commencing december   the salaried pension plan will cease accruing further benefits 
in  we recorded a loss of million related to the plan freeze 
in addition  we recorded a million decrease in our pension liability 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents income taxes 
the conclusion that deferred tax assets are realizable is subject to certain assessments  projections and judgments made by management 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable  the standard we use is whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryforward periods  projected taxable income  and amounts of taxable income we would have generated historically if we had been a stand alone company in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax asset  we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
based on existing deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these future deductible differences  excluding items for which we have already recorded a valuation allowance 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the united states and canada and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management exercises judgment in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to uncertain tax positions which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
while actual results could vary  in management s judgment  the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters 
purchase accounting and goodwill 
our recent acquisition of cellu tissue was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance 
in accordance with the accounting guidance  we revalued the assets and liabilities acquired at their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period affecting the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could have a material impact on our earnings 
goodwill from an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
as a result of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and at any time when events suggest impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we incorporate assumptions involving future growth rates  discount rates and tax rates in projecting the future cash flows 
in the event the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
results of operations during the period from december  through december   we have operated as and were accounted for as a separate public company 
our results of operations and financial condition discussed below cover periods prior to our spin off from potlatch and related transactions on december  the historical financial and other data for periods prior to the spin off were prepared on a combined basis from potlatch s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations and bases of the assets and liabilities of potlatch s consumer products and pulp and paperboard segments and its wood products operation at lewiston  idaho  and give effect to allocations of expenses from potlatch 
our historical financial and other data are not necessarily indicative of our future performance  nor do they necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we operated as a separate  stand alone entity prior to the spin off 
the results discussed below include cellu tissue operating results for the period december  through december  
table of contents at december   our business was organized into two reporting segments consumer products and pulp and paperboard 
commencing on january   the wood products operating results were consolidated into the pulp and paperboard segment in order to conform to our new management structure beginning in we have reclassified applicable segment data of the prior period to reflect this segment change 
sales or transfers between segments are recorded as intersegment net sales based on prevailing market prices 
starting in  sales between segments will be recorded at cost

as discussed in detail below under discussion of business segments  the increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing for our pulp and paperboard products as well as increased shipment volumes in all our segments

as discussed in detail below under discussion of business segments  the decrease in net sales was driven by lower volumes for our paperboard products which were partially offset by modest price increases 
our lumber and pulp shipments to external parties increased in but were more than offset by lower prices 
our consumer products volumes and prices were both up from cost of sales cost of sales decreased million  or  from to primarily due to two factors i an overall decrease in wood fiber costs due to the significant decline in the price of logs caused by the poor housing market and ii a decrease in petroleum and petroleum based product costs due to the general economic decline  which resulted in lower natural gas prices  lower transportation costs and a reduction in the costs of petroleum based chemicals used in our production processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher annual incentive based compensation related expenses and the costs associated with additional director fees recorded in as a result of an increase in the value of equity based awards 
the increase is also due to additional corporate administration expenses associated with being a new  independent  publicly traded company  such as audit fees  relocation costs and consulting costs associated with hiring new executives and the consolidation of our corporate functions in a new headquarters 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were favorably affected by approximately million of income from legal settlements

partially offsetting the interest expense was million in interest income we recorded in clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents debt retirement costs we recorded approximately million of expenses in associated with the retirement of our million note payable obligation to potlatch 
the million note payable represented the principal amount of credit sensitive debentures originally issued by an affiliate of potlatch

the higher net selling prices were driven by the increased sales of premium and ultra quality tissue products 
segment expenses decreased million in the decrease was primarily the result of decreased transportation costs of approximately million  energy costs of approximately million  pulp costs of approximately million and packaging costs of approximately million 
this was partially offset by increased usage of purchased paper of approximately million and other costs due to higher volumes

pulp net sales decreased million from to driven primarily by lower pricing 
net sales of our lumber products decreased million primarily due to a decrease in net selling prices in expenses for the segment decreased approximately million in primarily due to lower costs for wood fiber  chemicals and energy 
the decreased wood fiber costs were largely attributable to lower chip and sawdust prices for our idaho pulp and paperboard operation in compared to the lower chip and sawdust prices were primarily the result of increased availability of residuals throughout as compared to 
table of contents earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda we use earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and ebitda excluding certain items identified in the table below  or adjusted ebitda  as supplemental performance measures  that are not required by  or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity or profitability 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda adjusted by eliminating certain non recurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for any of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital assets  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not include cash pension payments  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda i as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation  ii to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and iii because our credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes and notes use measures similar to ebitda to measure our compliance with certain covenants

these decreases were offset by receipt of million in cash from the federal government during primarily related to the afmtc claimed with respect to the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million for compared to was attributable to higher net earnings  which were due to the recognition of income from the afmtc and increased operating income 
offsetting the operating cash flows was the recording of million in taxes receivable associated with the afmtc 
for the last five months of  we elected to defer receiving payments for the afmtc and instead elected to claim the credit on our income tax return 
the increase in taxes receivable was partially offset by the establishment of million in non current accrued taxes associated with the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased from to the increased use of cash was largely due to our acquisition of cellu tissue for million  offset by cash acquired of million  as well as increased cash spent on additions to plant and equipment in these increased uses of cash were partially offset by converting million in short term investments into cash 
cash spent on additions to plant and equipment increased million in compared to due primarily to capital spending on our new tissue manufacturing and converting facilities in shelby  north carolina as well as other capital improvement projects 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities from to was due to the addition of million of short term investments reflecting the investment of our cash assets  including cash generated from the afmtc  a portion of the proceeds from our million senior note offering  and cash from operations 
the majority of our capital expenditures in were spent on various discretionary  high return projects for the consumer products and pulp and paperboard segments  as well as various routine general replacement projects for each of our segments 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used for financing activities of million in in we received net proceeds of million from the notes  which were used to partially fund the acquisition of cellu tissue and related expenses 
this increase in cash was offset by the retirement of million of cellu tissue notes and the repayment of million outstanding under cellu tissue s revolving line of credit at the completion of the acquisition 
net cash used for financing activities was million in  compared to million in the increase in compared to primarily consisted of the repayment of i the note payable to potlatch and related debt retirement costs of million  ii payables to potlatch of million  iii and the repayment of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these were partially offset by net proceeds from long term debt of million 

table of contents capital resources due to an environment of economic uncertainty  as well as the competitive and cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  there is uncertainty regarding the amount of cash flows we will generate during the next twelve months 
however  we believe that our cash flows from operations as well as our cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash required to support our ongoing operations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as of december   our short term investments are not restricted and are invested in time or demand deposits  certificates of deposit and us treasury and us government agency obligations  all of which have very short maturity periods

we transferred approximately million of these proceeds to a trustee in satisfaction of our obligation related to the indenture under which million principal amount of credit sensitive debentures due december   were originally issued by an affiliate of potlatch 
the obligation to repay the credit sensitive debentures and all interest through maturity was retained by us prior to our spin off from potlatch 
the million consisted of the million principal amount underlying the credit sensitive debentures  plus million recorded as debt retirement costs on our consolidated statement of operations  representing our interest obligation due to holders of the debentures on december   plus approximately million included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
the million of restricted cash represented the difference between the current estimate of the interest payment due to holders of the debentures on december   and the interest payment that would be owed on december   if the maximum interest rate applicable to the credit sensitive debentures were to have applied 
the million was returned to us during the fourth quarter of after payment of the million principal amount and accrued interest on december   and thus was no longer included as restricted cash as of december  in our consolidated statement of cash flows as presented in prior filings  we previously reflected the proceeds from the debt issuance on a net basis

table of contents credit arrangements on november   we entered into a four year million revolving credit facility with certain financial institutions 
during  the terms of our revolving credit facility were amended to i permit our acquisition of cellu tissue  ii permit the construction of our new manufacturing facilities in shelby  north carolina  iii increase our ability to acquire capital and iv modify the factors used in the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these amendments resulted in the removal of a million borrowing capacity reserve previously required 
the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable plus approximately of our eligible inventory  or million 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  but approximately million of the credit facility was being used to support outstanding standby letters of credit 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus between and for libor loans  and a base rate effectively equal to the agent bank s prime rate plus between and for other loans

off balance sheet arrangements we currently are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that would require disclosure under this section 
environmental our operating facilities are subject to rigorous federal and state environmental regulation governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management 
our goal is continuous compliance with all environmental regulations and we regularly monitor our activities to ensure compliance with all pertinent rules and requirements 
compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs 
of our manufacturing sites  six were audited for environmental compliance by independent auditors in no material issues were identified during these audits 
seven audits will occur in with a goal of every facility undergoing a detailed environmental audit by third parties at least once every three years 
during the next three to five years  our tissue manufacturing and converting facility located in neenah  wisconsin will become regulated under a reduced waste water discharge limit associated with a total maximum daily limit promulgated for the lower fox river 
the specific requirements of this new regulation are presently unknown 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents a new federal standard for hazardous air pollutants from boiler and process heaters was proposed and subsequently delayed in by the us environmental protection agency  or epa 
the most recent communication from the epa is that this new standard will become effective in our sites at lewiston  idaho and menominee  michigan are expected to be impacted by this new rule  although the specific requirements of this new rule remain uncertain 
the epa is also currently reviewing the risks associated with hazardous air pollutants from kraft paper mills 
any changes to these rules would impact our operations in lewiston  idaho and cypress bend  arkansas 
concern over climate change  including the impact of global warming  has led to significant regulatory and legislative initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
in the united states supreme court ruled that the epa was authorized to regulate carbon dioxide under the clean air act 
as a consequence  the epa initiated a series of regulatory efforts aimed at addressing greenhouse gases as pollutants  including finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health  implementing mandatory greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements applicable to some of our manufacturing operations  and promulgating rules to limit the growth in greenhouse gases from new projects at certain types of facilities applicable to some of our manufacturing sites 
it is unclear what the overall effect of epa greenhouse gas regulation will have on our operations until final rules are promulgated 
legislation has also been proposed to address greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change  including cap and trade programs  and some form of federal climate change legislation or additional federal regulation is possible 
it is not yet known when and to what extent these and other federal  state and international legislative and policy activities may come into force  how they may relate to each other in the future  or how they may affect our operations 
our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that situations that may give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered or that the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations will not require significant expenditures by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our exposure to market risks on financial instruments includes fair value risk on our fixed rate debt and interest rate risk on our secured revolving credit facility as well as the irbs assumed by us upon our acquisition of cellu tissue 
revolving credit facility as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rates applied to borrowings under the revolving credit facility are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
for example  a increase or decrease in interest rates  based on assumed outstanding credit facility borrowings of million  would have a million annual effect on interest expense 
we currently do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short term interest rate fluctuations on our credit facility borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments 
industrial revenue bonds as of december   there was million outstanding under the irbs 
the interest rate applicable to the irbs adjusts on a weekly basis 
a increase or decrease in interest rates  based on the current outstanding balance of million  would have a million annual effect on interest expense 
we currently do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short term interest rate fluctuations on the irbs through the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents commodity risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  which we have historically partially mitigated through the use of firm price contracts for a portion of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
as of december   these contracts covered approximately of our expected average monthly natural gas requirements for we are also subject to commodity price risk associated with pulp costs and take advantage of spot prices on pulp to minimize market risk arising from changes in pulp costs 
we have agreements with pulp vendors to purchase pulp over the next year 
these commitments require purchases of pulp up to approximately  tons per year at pulp prices below published list prices and allow us to shift a portion of our pulp purchases to the spot market to take advantage of spot market prices when such prices fall 
we believe that our current commitment under these arrangements or their equivalent approximates of our current budgeted pulp needs in foreign currency risk virtually all of our non us sales are denominated in non us dollars and accordingly we are not subject to currency exchange risks associated with the receipt of payments in foreign currencies 
however  we are currently subject to foreign exchange currency risks associated with overseas purchases of equipment for our north carolina tissue converting facility 
as part of our risk management strategy  we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this foreign currency risk 
in the latter half of  we began entering into foreign exchange forward contracts  not designated for hedge accounting  with the intent to reduce foreign exchange exposure associated with these equipment purchases 
as of december   the notional amount of our outstanding forward contracts ranged from less than million to million  offsetting our exposures to the euro 
the total notional amount as of december  was million 
we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures 
accordingly  we do not use derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes
