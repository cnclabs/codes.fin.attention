supplemental educational services division the ses division provided state aligned research based academic tutoring instruction to students in schools in need of improvement in school districts throughout the country which receive funding under the no child left behind act of nclb 
in the school year we experienced greater variability in school districts willingness to fully utilize funds allocated to ses programs  as well as generally later program start dates and greater competition from individual school districts that developed and offered internally developed ses programs 
in addition  there is increased uncertainty about the future of nclb and the concept of adequate yearly performance as a means of allocating title i funding

tutoring revenue declined by approximately million due to reduced hours of tutoring per student despite increased enrollments and increases in price per hour of tutoring 
we will be working to increase the number of hours per student in institutional revenue decreased by approximately  due to some one time perpetual license sales in that were not repeated in we expect institutional sales to grow as college readiness becomes a critical metric to evaluate the success of k schools and districts 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in online revenues as we continue to market our expanding online course content  and an increase of  in licensing revenue due to new publications and increased book sales 
penn foster revenues increased by million  to million in from million in these revenues primarily represent tuition sales from individual students enrolled and completing exams in penn foster s online career school  college and high school educational institutions 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the company having owned the division for the full year in  as compared to the prior year when the division was acquired on december  the division has been pursuing a strategy of shifting enrollment focus to a more committed student base  resulting in higher revenues per enrollment 
consistent with this strategy  slightly lower enrollments during  as compared to including the pre acquisition period  were offset by higher revenues per enrollment

table of contents ses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is due primarily to lower compensation expense and cost reductions as a result of the decline in revenue and due to our decision to exit the ses business as of the end of the school year 
we do not expect to incur any ses selling  general and administrative expenses beyond december  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million in from million in primarily due to increased compensation expense and increased professional service fees attributed to our outsourced information technology function and due to the elimination of corporate overhead allocated to the ses business during the third and fourth quarters of  as we are no longer operating the ses business following the school year which ended in june depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by million to million from million in the increase is primarily the result of million of incremental depreciation and amortization on the fixed and intangible assets acquired with penn foster on december   coupled with million of accelerated depreciation and amortization charges associated with actions taken to exit the ses business  to close our administrative office in new york city and to cease use of our legacy erp system and utilize penn foster s erp system prospectively 
in addition  we changed the estimated useful lives for certain fixed assets under a revised depreciation policy  resulting in additional depreciation and amortization of million 
we also recorded million of amortization expense for the year ended december  relating to a license acquired in conjunction with the nlc strategic venture 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to the impact of assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives

in addition  in september we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec utilizing a shelf registration process whereby we may from time to time offer and sell common stock  preferred stock  warrants or units  or any combination of these securities  in one or more offerings up to a total amount of million 
in april  we sold million shares of common stock through this shelf registration process for a public offering price of million before underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses and received million of net proceeds which were used to repay the bridge notes  invest in the nlc venture and for general working capital purposes

the new credit facility provides for more favorable interest rates and greater flexibility with respect to financial maintenance covenants 
the net proceeds received from the refinancing of million after deducting lender fees have and will be used to invest in strategic ventures and for general working capital purposes 

table of contents on december   we acquired penn foster for an aggregate purchase price in cash of million plus a working capital payment of approximately million paid at closing  and  paid in march to finance the acquisition  we i borrowed million through a term loan under a credit agreement entered into with ge capital ii borrowed million under a senior subordinated note purchase agreement entered into with sankaty credit opportunities iv  lp sankaty and falcon mezzanine partners ii and certain of its affiliates falcon  iii borrowed million in junior subordinated debt under a securities purchase agreement entered into with sankaty and falcon  iv borrowed million under a bridge note purchase agreement entered into with sankaty  and v issued an aggregate of  shares of series e non convertible preferred stock series e preferred stock with a stated value of  per share  including  shares of series e preferred stock in exchange for all outstanding series c convertible preferred stock 
the terms of these financings are described in greater detail following our discussion of operating  investing and financing activities below 
we expect our principal sources of funding for operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments in strategic ventures and debt service obligations during to be our current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as was the case with our original credit facility with ge capital  our new debt financing agreements contain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness and that require us to comply with financial covenant ratios that are dependent on maintaining certain operating performance levels on an ongoing basis 
specifically  our financial maintenance covenants include maximum ratios of total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined  that decrease with the passage of time  and minimum ratios of adjusted cash flows as defined to fixed charges as defined  that increase with the passage of time 
in addition  the covenants limit our annual capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december  in march  we entered into amendments to our debt financing agreements that provide greater flexibility by adjusting the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for in addition  the amendments increase the interest rate under the credit facility by and add a minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum level of cash on hand  including accessible borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility as defined 
we believe the above sources of funding will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures  investments in strategic ventures and debt service obligations for the next twelve months and beyond 
however  our ability to generate sufficient operating income and positive cash flows from operations to maintain compliance under our debt agreements is dependent on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
in addition to generating positive income from operations  the timing of cash payments received under our customer arrangements is a primary factor impacting our liquidity 
our her and penn foster divisions generate the largest portion of our cash flow from operations primarily from retail classroom  online and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
across her and penn foster  we also generate cash from contracts with institutions such as schools and school districts and post secondary institutions all of which pay us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to cash interest payments under our term loan credit facility and the bridge and senior subordinated notes totaling million  lower ses revenues and related collections  decreased profitability in our her division and additional operating expenses to support the start up of strategic ventures in  offset by cash generated from penn foster s operations 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to cash used for operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter cash expenditures relating to our declining ses business as compared to the quarter ended december   an increase in payables attributed to our expanding system upgrades  and improved collections in fourth quarter accounts receivable  as compared to the quarter ended december  cash flows from investing activities cash flows used for investing activities from continuing operations during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an amendment to goodwill impairment testing 
the amendment modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not anticipate any impact from our adoption of this guidance since we do not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts at december  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we will adopt this guidance in the event we consummate a business acquisition in the future 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued an update to an accounting standard that requires additional disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables  such as aging information and credit quality indicators 
both new and existing disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment or class 
the disaggregation of information is based on how allowances for credit losses are developed and how credit exposure is managed 
this update is effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after december  and did not have an impact on our financial statements included herein 
in january  the fasb issued an accounting standard update that improves disclosures about fair value measurements  including adding new disclosure requirements for significant transfers in and out of level and measurements and to provide a gross presentation of the activities within the level rollforward 
the update also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   and are effective for the company on january   except for the requirement to present the level rollforward on a gross basis  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is effective for the company on january  the company adopted this accounting standard  including the deferred portion relating to the level rollforward on january   resulting in additional footnote disclosures regarding certain financial assets and liabilities held by the company as described in note in the accompanying financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force the eitf reached final consensus on the issue related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this issue is effective for the company s revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we have evaluated this issue and do not believe it will materially impact our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
the new approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance 
further  the new accounting standard requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
it also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  it requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  an enterprise is required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
the pronouncement became effective for the company on january  and the company applied the provisions in connection with the strategic venture entered into with national labor college in april  as described in note with the exception of this new strategic venture  the adoption of this accounting standard did not change any of the company s previous conclusions regarding our vies and thus did not have an effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  recognition and measurement of current and 
table of contents deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services and the estimates we use to record stock based compensation expense 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our receivables on a regular basis to determine if past due balances are likely to be collected 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  assessment of the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
at the time of an acquisition  we allocate goodwill and related assets and liabilities to our respective reporting units 
we identify reporting units by assessing whether the components of operating segments constitute businesses and for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
indefinite lived intangible assets are recorded at fair market value on their acquisition date and include territorial marketing rights and trade names  assets that we believe have the continued ability to generate cash flows indefinitely and which have no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the useful life to the company 
goodwill  territorial marketing rights and trade names are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment at least annually  on october of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a two step test 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of its net assets 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and there is no need to apply the second step of testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform a second step which involves using a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we rely on an income based approach using the discounted cash flow valuation method 
we generally project cash flows  as well as a terminal value  by calculating cash flow scenarios  applying a reasonable weighting to these scenarios and discounting such cash flows by a risk adjusted rate of return 
we also incorporate the use of a market based approach in combination with the discounted cash flow analysis and apply a reasonable weighting of the results 
generally  the market based approach incorporates information from comparable transactions in the market and publicly 
table of contents traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit to develop a multiple which is then applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit to determine value 
management believes the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units  include  but are not limited to  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit  the discount rate applied to those cash flows  long term growth rates and selection of comparable market multiples 
the assumptions used in determining our expected future cash flows consider various factors such as anticipated operating trends particularly in student enrollment and pricing  planned capital investments  anticipated economic and regulatory conditions and planned business and operating strategies over a long term horizon 
the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we perform our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests on the same dates that we perform the annual goodwill impairment tests for our respective reporting units 
to determine the fair value of our her territorial marketing rights intangible asset  we use a discounted cash flow valuation approach  based on estimated royalty income generated from our product sales 
to determine the fair value of our penn foster tradename intangible asset  we use the relief from royalty method 
this method estimates the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying royalties for the right to use a comparable asset 
this method incorporates the use of significant judgments in determining both the projected revenues attributable to the asset  as well as the appropriate discount rate and royalty rates applied to those revenues to determine fair value 
during  events and circumstances  primarily a shortfall in actual operating results versus plan in our her division  indicated that million of goodwill allocated to our her division could become impaired 
however  findings from our step one test indicated that the estimated fair value of our her division exceeded the carrying value of its assets by approximately and therefore the goodwill was not impaired 
nonetheless  it is reasonably possible that the estimate of fair value may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down the goodwill or intangible assets 
our estimate of fair value was based upon several significant assumptions including  but not limited to  enrollment levels  pricing per enrollment  product mix  gross margin and planned capital investments in systems  products and facilities 
management believes its assumptions and cash flow projections are reasonably achievable given current market conditions and planned business and operating strategies 
findings from our step one test on the penn foster division indicated that the estimated fair value of the division exceeded the carrying value of its assets by approximately  and therefore million of goodwill allocated to our penn foster division was not impaired 
given the recent acquisition of penn foster and this division s successful performance to date  management expects the estimated fair value of penn foster to reasonably approximate or slightly exceed the division s carrying value 
there were no impairments to the indefinite lived intangible assets based on our annual impairment test results 
impairment of long lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
we assess recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total projected undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered 
table of contents to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based upon management s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
income taxes companies are required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we assess the likelihood that we will realize our deferred tax assets and if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we are required to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective primarily for her institutional contracts that require us to provide more than one product or service and accordingly record revenue in accordance with an accounting standard that provides guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  we must estimate the accounting value attributable to the different contractual elements and determine the timing for recognition of each element 
revenue is allocated to each element based on our assessment of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
in addition  in our penn foster division we record revenue from sales to individual students as exams are completed at the expected rate per exam based on the division s historical experience over a large homogenous population 
the majority of students pay for tuition under periodic payment plans 
the division has historically experienced significant non payment issues related to the payment plans and accordingly  the division believes collectability under such arrangements is not reasonably assured  therefore revenue is not recognized until services are provided and cash is received provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
payments received prior to delivery of services are initially recorded as deferred revenue  and revenue is then recognized as exams are completed 
restructuring our facilities related expenses and liabilities under all of our restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in accordance with an accounting standard that requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all shared based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
the standard requires 
table of contents companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the standard  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence compensation expense 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue  results of operations and cash flows because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our her revenue in the third quarter 
penn foster s revenue is typically generated more evenly throughout the year but marketing and promotional expenses are seasonally higher in the first quarter 
ses revenue was typically concentrated in the first and fourth quarters to more closely reflect the after school programs greatest activity during the school year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the outstanding debt under our senior credit facilities  which bear interest  at the company s option  at either libor or a defined base rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   our total outstanding term loan balance under the senior credit facilities exposed to variable interest rates was million 
a increase in the interest rate on this balance would increase annual interest expense by  we do not carry any other variable interest rate debt 
revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our total revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
