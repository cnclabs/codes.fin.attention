see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net we earned thousand of interest income in and  respectively 
we incurred interest expense of thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest payments associated with the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities with silicon valley bank in compared with we recorded a loss of million on the equity investment in the joint venture with gloria solar in included in this loss for is an impairment charge of thousand to reduce the value of the investment to the estimated proceeds from the liquidation of the joint venture 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we had currency exchange losses of approximately thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
income taxes we recorded a tax benefit on our loss from continuing operations of million and million for and  respectively  which was offset by a provision on our income from discontinued operation of million and million for and  respectively 
gross federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately million as of december  and expire at various times through we have a full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets at december  due to uncertainty regarding realization of these assets in the future 
income loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we began pursuing an exclusive sales process of our medical products business unit 
on december   we completed the sale of the medical products business unit to bard access systems  inc accordingly  the results and assets of the medical products business unit are being presented herein as discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
we recorded net income from discontinued operations of million in included in discontinued operations for is a gain on sale of business unit to bard of million and an income tax provision of million 
not included in discontinued operations are certain indirect costs of the medical products business unit that have been reclassified to selling  general and administrative expense of thousand for included in the gain of million is proceeds received from bard of million  less licenses transferred to bard of thousand and less legal and professional fees related to complete the sale of thousand

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss we reported a net loss of thousand and million for and  respectively 
the improvement of approximately million is primarily due to improved margins in solar equipment sales in  partially offset by lower gain on termination of contacts and lower net income from discontinued operations  net of tax in liquidity and capital resources december  december  increase decrease in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital cash and cash equivalents decreased due to cash used in operating activities and to a lesser extent financing activities  partially offset by cash provided by investing activities  primarily due to one time payments received in the second quarter of totaling million related to the sale of the medical products business unit included in discontinued operations 
the overall increase in working capital is due to a decrease in current liabilities  p rimarily accounts payable  accrued liabilities and advances on contracts in process  partially offset by reductions to cash  inventories and deferred cost of goods sold 
we have historically funded our operating cash requirements using operating cash flow  proceeds from the sale and licensing of technology and assets and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
there are no material commitments by us for capital expenditures 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million compared to accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have numerous options on how to fund future operational losses or working capital needs  including but not limited to sales of equity  bank debt or the sale or license of assets and technology  as we have done in the past  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to sell equity  obtain or access bank debt  or sell or license assets or technology on a timely basis and at appropriate values 
we have developed several plans including cost containment efforts and outside financing to offset a decline in business due to the recent global economic recession 
as a result  we believe we have sufficient resources to finance our current operations through at least december  loan agreements on june   we entered into two separate credit facilities with silicon valley bank the bank or svb providing for credit lines of up to million in the aggregate i an amended and restated loan and security agreement the restated revolving credit facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line of up to million and ii an export import bank loan and security agreement the ex im facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line of up to million to be guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states the exim bank

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu revenue recognition topic applicability of aicpa statement of position to certain arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu excludes tangible products containing software components and non software c omponents that function together to deliver the product essential functionality from the scope of asc  software revenue recognition 
asu shall be applied on a prospective basis to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
upon adoption  we must apply asu retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or to all periods presented 
we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  on the subtopic  multiple element arrangements 
the amendment impacts the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  the amendment modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
the amendment is effective for revenue arrangements entered or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   however early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires interim disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
additionally  this asu requires disclosure for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
these disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level further  the asu requires separate presentation of level act ivity for the fair value measurements 
we adopted the provisions of this standard on january   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
manufacturing equipment and solar systems are generally quoted  manufactured and shipped within a cycle of approximately nine months  allowing for orderly pricing adjustment s to the cost of labor and purchased parts 
we have not experienced any negative effects from the impact of inflation on long term contracts 
our service business is not expected to be seriously affected by inflation because its procurement production cycle typically ranges from two weeks to several months  and prices generally are not fixed for more than one year 
research and development contracts usually include cost escalation provisions 
foreign currency fluctuation we sell almost exclusively in us dollars  generally against an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit through a major united states bank 
accordingly  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuati ons in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on our customers access to us dollars and on the pricing competition on certain pieces of equipment that we sell in selected markets 
we have committed to purchase certain pieces of equipment from european and japanese vendors  these commitments are denominated in euros and yen  respectively 
we bear the risk of any currency fluctuations that may be associated with these commitments 
we attempt to hedge known transactions when possible to minimize foreign exchange risk 
we had no hedging activity in and the hedging activities during were not material at any point during the year 
foreign exchange loss included in other expense was thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
related party transactions on november   we entered into a new lease agreement the bedford lease rdq uo  with spi trust  a trust of which roger g 
little  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of the company  is the sole trustee and principal beneficiary  with respect to  square feet of space comprising the entire building in which we have occupied space since december  the term of the bedford lease commenced on december  and was originally set to expire on november  the annual rental rate for the first year of the bedford lease was per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increased on each anniversary by per square foot 
on september   we entered into the fi rst amendment to lease agreement with spi trust to amend the bedford lease 
the term of the bedford lease was extended for an additional five years to expire on november  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term december  through november  is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  and warranty reserves 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounti ng policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from continuing operations from three primary sources commercial products including  but not limited to  solar energy manufacturing equipment  solar energy systems and solar energy materials  biomedical and semiconductor proces sing services  and united states government funded research and development contracts we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
our oem capital equipment solar energy business builds complex customized machines to order for specific customers 
most orders are sold on a fob bedford  massachusetts or ex works factory basis and other orders are sold on a carriage and insurance paid or cip  or on rare situations  a delivery duty unpaid or ddu basis 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for this equipment as title of the product has passed to the customer  as customer acceptance is obtained prior to shipment and the equipment is expected to operate the same in the customer environment as it does in our environment 
when an arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when those obligations are met or customer acceptance has been achieved 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate total fees under contract to each element using the relative fair value method and revenue is recognized upon delivery of each element 
if we are not able to establish fair value of undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until customer final acceptance is obtained 
our solar systems business provides photovoltaic systems for application to powering buildings with connection to the utility grid 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these systems as title passes  the customer accepts the system installation and interconnection to the grid is achieved 
our solar materials business supplies photovoltaic materials under a united states government contact 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these materials as title passes and the government accepts the materials 
we recognize revenues and estimated profits on long term government contracts on the accrual basis where the circumstances are such that total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
we accrue revenue and profit utilizing the percentage of completion method using a cost to cost methodology 
a percentage of the contract revenues and estimated profits is determined utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to complete on a contract by contract basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
some of the c ontracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage until such time as the united states government performs an audit of the cost incurred under the contract 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as it performs against the contract since we have not experienced any substantial losses as a result of audits performed by the united states government 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
we actively pursue collection of past due receivables as the circumstances warrant 
customers are contacted to determine the status of payment and senior accounting and operations management are included in these efforts as is deemed necessary 
a specific reserve will be established for past due accounts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we do not record an allowance for government receivables and invoices backed by letters of credit as realizability is reasonably assured 
bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified 
there is no dollar threshold for account balance write offs 
while rare  a write off is only recorded when all efforts to collect the receivable have been exhausted 
inventories and reserve for excess and obsolescence we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
font style font family inherit  font size pt  font style italic  impairmen t of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such as sets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation we account for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc compen sation stock compensation 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method for determining the fair value of stock option grants 
asc requires the fair value of all share based awards that are expected to vest to be recognized in the statements of operations over the service or vesting period of each award 
we use the straight line method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense for all stock option grants over the requisite service period 
warranty we provide warranties on certain products and services 
our warranty programs are described below we generally warrant solar energy module manufacturing equipment sold for a total of days  the first days of which include the replacement of defective component parts and the labor to correct the defect and the next days of which include only the cost of defective component parts 
spire biomedical warrants that any of its catheter products found to be defective will be replaced 
no warranty is made that the failure of the product will not occur  and spire disclaims any responsibility for any medical complications 
spire biomedical warrants that its services only will meet the agreed upon specifications 
spire semiconductor warrants that its products will meet the agreed upon specifications 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  determined primarily from historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
should actual product failure warranties differ from our es timates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required
