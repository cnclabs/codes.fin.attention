qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk  and item a 
risk factors we may continue to enter into derivative financial instruments to manage the price risks associated with our production 
our derivative financial instruments may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from benefiting from increases in prices for oil and gas and if our access to markets is restricted  it could negatively impact our production  our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases 
our ability to sell natural gas and or receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints 
competition and technological changes we encounter competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have been engaged in the oil and gas business for much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
we may not be able to conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment 
the oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we 
table of contents are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various federal  state  local and international environmental regulations that may change from time to time  including regulations governing oil and gas production and transportation  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control and state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit 
these regulations may affect the amount of oil and gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other regulated transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and gas  protect rights to produce oil and gas between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production  provide nondiscriminatory access to common carrier pipelines and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the following discussion summarizes the regulation of the united states oil and gas industry 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject  although we cannot assure you that this is or will remain the case 
moreover  those statutes  rules  regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and any such changes or reinterpretations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject 
regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels that require permits for the drilling of wells  mandate that we maintain bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulate the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states including louisiana allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states including texas rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary  it may be more difficult to form units and therefore more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than of the leasehold 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
because these laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended and reinterpreted  we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act of nga  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
effective january   the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  including all of our sales of our own production 
as a result  all of our domestically produced natural gas is sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 
the ferc s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation  however  was not affected by the decontrol act 

table of contents under the nga  facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe satisfy the ferc s criteria for establishing that these are all gathering facilities not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental  and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation 
some of the delay in bringing our natural gas to market has been the lack of available pipeline systems in the barnett shale  particularly those that would take natural gas production from the lease to existing infrastructure 
in order to partly alleviate this issue  commencing in  certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have constructed non jurisdictional gathering facilities in cases where we have determined that we can construct those facilities more quickly or more efficiently than waiting on an unrelated third party pipeline company 
one of our pipeline subsidiaries  hondo pipeline inc  exercises the power of eminent domain and transports gas for third parties and is a regulated public utility within the meaning of section the gas utility regulatory act or gura and section the cox act of the texas utilities code 
both gura and the cox act prohibit unreasonable discrimination in the transportation of natural gas and authorize the texas railroad commission rrc to regulate gas transportation rates 
however  gura provides for negotiated rates with transportation  industrial or similar large volume contract customers so long as neither party has an unfair negotiating advantage  the negotiated rate is substantially the same as that negotiated with at least two other customers under similar conditions  or sufficient competition existed when the rate was negotiated 
although we do not own or operate any pipelines or facilities that are directly regulated by the ferc  its regulations of third party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to market our production 
beginning in the s the ferc initiated a series of major restructuring orders that required pipelines  among other things  to perform open access transportation  unbundle their sales and transportation functions  and allow shippers to release their pipeline capacity to other shippers 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties 
we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while  at the same time  substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
it remains to be seen  however  what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets  the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business 
we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities 
in the past  congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation 
however  the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation or lighter handed regulation and the promotion of competition in the gas industry 
in light of this increased reliance on competition  the energy policy act of amended the nga to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the transportation  purchase or sale of natural gas 
in addition to the regulations implementing these prohibitions  the ferc has established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through  among other things  expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold and new regulations that require both interstate pipelines and certain non interstate pipelines to post daily information regarding their design capacity and daily scheduled flow volumes at certain points on their systems 
the energy policy act of also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc s regulations to up to million per day for each violation 
oil price controls and transportation rates our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective as of january   the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to specified conditions and limitations 
these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline  although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year 
every five years  the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry 
in march  to implement the second of the required five yearly re determinations  the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes 
the ferc determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus percent ppi plus percent should be the oil pricing index for the five year period beginning july  we are not able at this time to predict the effects of this indexing system or any new ferc regulations on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations 
there regularly are legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures which  if enacted  would significantly affect the petroleum industry 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or 
table of contents the various state legislatures and what effect  if any  such proposals might have on us 
similarly  we cannot predict whether or to what extent the trend toward federal deregulation of the petroleum industry will continue  particularly in light of the change in the us administration in  or what the ultimate effect on our sales of oil  gas and other petroleum products will be 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on specified lands within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions prohibiting or limiting the extent of our operations 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
the trend of applying more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations to the oil and gas industry could continue  resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting our profitability 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we generate waste that may be subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the us environmental protection agency epa  and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous waste 
furthermore  certain waste generated by our oil and gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous waste may in the future be designated as hazardous waste and therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
we currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
although we believe that we have implemented appropriate operating and waste disposal practices  prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices  and hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we own or lease or on or under locations where such waste have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other waste was not under our control 
these properties and the waste disposed thereon may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and gas waste 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
see item a 
risk factors we are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations  including those relating to benzene emissions and hydraulic fracturing  and new regulations may be more stringent 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on specified classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these classes of persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
our operations may be subject to the clean air act caa and comparable state and local requirements 
in congress adopted amendments to the caa containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations 
the epa and states have developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission related issues 
moreover  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs 
further  stricter requirements could negatively impact our production and operations 
for example  the texas commission on environmental quality tceq and the rrc have been 
table of contents evaluating possible additional regulation of air emissions in the barnett shale area  in response to concerns about allegedly high concentrations of benzene in the air near drilling sites and natural gas processing facilities 
these initiatives could lead to more stringent air permitting  increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local  state  and federal levels 
additionally  the epa is currently considering  pursuant to a court mandated settlement  whether to strengthen regulations under the caa  including the new source performance standards nsps  maximum achievable control technology mact standards and residual risk standards  affecting a wide array of air emission sources in the oil and gas industry 
please read part ii  item a 
risk factors we are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations  including those relating to benzene emissions and hydraulic fracturing  and new regulations may be more stringent 
federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil  such as us  to prepare and implement spill prevention  control  countermeasure spcc and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters 
the oil pollution act of opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill  including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 
the opa also requires owners and operators of offshore facilities that could be the source of an oil spill into federal or state waters  including wetlands  to post a bond  letter of credit or other form of financial assurance in amounts ranging from million in specified state waters to million in federal outer continental shelf waters to cover costs that could be incurred by governmental authorities in responding to an oil spill 
these financial assurances may be increased by as much as million if a formal risk assessment indicates that the increase is warranted 
noncompliance with opa may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities 
our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act cwa and analogous state laws 
in accordance with the cwa  the state of louisiana issued regulations prohibiting discharges of produced water in state coastal waters effective july  pursuant to other requirements of the cwa  the epa has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff 
this program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits or seek coverage under an epa general permit 
like opa  the cwa and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground 
similarly  the us congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under that act and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
please read item a 
risk factors we are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations  including those relating to benzene emissions and hydraulic fracturing  and new regulations may be more stringent 
we also are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and international permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our offshore operations in the uk north sea and onshore operations in the us are subject to similar regulations covering permit requirements and the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
global climate change there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
on september   the epa issued a mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule which was subsequently amended on july  the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme  beginning in  requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions occurring in the prior calendar year on a facility by facility basis 
on november   the epa issued final rules applying these regulations to the oil and gas source category including oil and natural gas production facilities  natural gas processing  transmission  distribution and storage facilities 
in addition  on december   the epa published a final rule  also known as the epa s endangerment finding  finding that current and projected concentrations of six key ghgs in the atmosphere threaten the environment and public health and the welfare of current and future generations 
following issuance of the endangerment finding  the epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards under the caa on april  that will require reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning in  the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil 
also  on may   the epa issued a prepublication version of a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the caa prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs 
this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions  to be phased in through a multistep process  with the largest sources being the first subject to permitting 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control 
table of contents technology standards  which will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
in november epa issued guidance on ghg best available control technology that will assist the various agencies in making these determinations 
in addition  the us congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals to restrict ghg emissions and more than states  either individually or as part of regional initiatives  have begun taking actions to control and or reduce ghg emissions 
moreover  in  the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  which establishes a binding set of emission targets for ghgs  became binding on all those countries that had ratified it 
international discussions are currently underway to develop an international scheme for the regulation and reduction of ghgs 
while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states or the north sea in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs 
in addition  existing or new laws  regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 
in addition to the effects of future regulation  the meteorological effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our onshore and offshore operations in the form of more frequent and or more intense storms and flooding  which could in turn adversely affect our cost of doing business 
operating hazards and insurance the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks that could result in substantial losses to us from  among other things  injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  cleanup responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not carry business interruption insurance or protect against loss of revenues 
we cannot assure you that any insurance we obtain will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
we may elect to self insure if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to our assessment of the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we participate in a number of our wells on a non operated basis  and may be accordingly limited in our ability to control the risks associated with oil and gas operations 
title to properties  acquisition risks we believe we currently have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in the specific areas in which we operate except where failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in each such area 
our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of these properties 
as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties  we perform limited investigations of record title at the time of acquisition other than a preliminary review of local records 
investigations  including a title opinion of local counsel  are generally made in conjunction with the commencement of drilling operations 
even then  particularly in urban settings  the cost of performing detailed title work can be expensive 
we may choose to forego detailed title examination by title lawyers on a portion of the mineral leases that we place in a drilling unit or conduct less title work than we have traditionally performed 
our revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our proved producing domestic oil and gas properties 
in acquiring producing properties  we assess the recoverable reserves  future domestic oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to fully assess its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not 
table of contents inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors our future acquisitions may yield revenues or production that varies significantly from our projections 
customers the company sold oil and gas production representing at least of its oil and gas revenues as follows year ended december  dte energy trading  inc cokinos natural gas company crosstex energy revenues were below 
we do not believe the loss of any one of our purchasers would materially affect our ability to sell the oil and gas we produce 
we believe other purchasers are available in our areas of operations 
see additional oil and gas disclosures marketing 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good 
in order to optimize prospect generation and development  we utilize the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of d seismic data mapping  acquisition of leases and lease options  construction  design  well site surveillance  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors generally provide field and on site production operation services  such as pumping  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and testing 
we believe that this use of third party service providers has enhanced our ability to contain general and administrative expenses 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel and the loss of any could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees

item a 
risk factors oil and gas prices are highly volatile  and lower oil and gas prices will negatively affect our financial position  planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
at times since july  publicly quoted spot natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil prices reached levels significantly lower than the record levels reached at that time 
in the past  some oil and gas companies have reduced or curtailed production to mitigate the impact of low oil and gas prices 
we have made similar decisions on selected properties in the recent past and may decide to curtail additional production as a result of a decrease in prices in the future 
the decrease in natural gas prices has had a significant impact on our financial position  planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
further volatility in oil and gas prices or a prolonged period of low oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial position  liquidity including our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
our revenue  profitability  cash flow  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and those markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas price movements with certainty 
prices for oil and gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  overall economic conditions  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental relations  regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions and unrest in oil producing regions  the level and price of foreign imports of oil and liquefied natural gas  and the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain production constraints and oil price controls 
oil and gas drilling is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs that could adversely affect us 
our success will be largely dependent upon the success of our drilling program 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control  including unexpected or adverse drilling conditions  elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  
table of contents equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs  crews and equipment 
because we identify the areas desirable for drilling in certain areas from d seismic data covering large areas  we may not seek to acquire an option or lease rights until after the seismic data is analyzed or until the drilling locations are also identified  in those cases  we may not be permitted to lease  drill or produce natural gas or oil from those locations 
even if drilled  our completed wells may not produce reserves of oil or gas that are economically viable or that meet our earlier estimates of economically recoverable reserves 
our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular project area may decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially harm our operations and financial position by reducing our available cash and resources 
the potential for production decline rates for our wells could be greater than we expect 
because of the risks and uncertainties of our business  our future performance in exploration and drilling may not be comparable to our historical performance described in this annual report on form k 
we may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule 
our final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors  including the results of our exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of the seismic data  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects  the approval of the prospects by the other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and crews  and the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
although we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects  we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame or at all 
wells that are currently part of our capital plan may be based on statistical results of drilling activities in other d project areas that we believe are geologically similar rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the prospect area  in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary  possibly materially  from those statistical results 
in addition  our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties 
instability in the global financial system may have impacts on our liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
instability in the global financial system may have a material impact on our liquidity and our financial condition  and we may ultimately face major challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not continue to improve from their lows in early our ability to access the capital markets or borrow money may be restricted or made more expensive at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an adverse impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures in the future 
the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us  and on the liquidity of our operating partners  resulting in delays in operations or their failure to make required payments 
also  market conditions could have an impact on our oil and gas derivative instruments if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
additionally  the current economic situation could lead to further reductions in the demand for oil and gas  or further reductions in the prices of oil and gas  or both  which could have a negative impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
while the ultimate outcome and impact of the current financial situation cannot be predicted  it may have a material adverse effect on our future liquidity  results of operations and financial position 

table of contents our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their estimated value  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data in this annual report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based on assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results 
accordingly  reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment  and actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary  possibly materially  from estimates 
additionally  there recently has been increased debate and disagreement over the classification of reserves  with particular focus on proved undeveloped reserves 
in late  the sec adopted new rules regarding the classification of reserves 
we adopted these oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective december  and  accordingly  the requirements became effective with the reserves reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  the interpretation of these rules and their applicability in different situations remain unclear in many respects 
changing interpretations of the classification standards or disagreements with our interpretations could cause us to write down reserves 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped and proved nonproducing 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in our reserve reports as of december  had produced for a relatively short period of time as of that date 
because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
in addition  realization or recognition of our proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
lack of reasonable certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
the discounted future net cash flows in this annual report are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
as required by the current requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average of the sales price on the first day of each month in the applicable year  with costs determined as of the date of the estimate 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for oil and gas  our actual operating costs in producing oil and gas  the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption of oil and gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  extractive activities oil and gas may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
we depend on successful exploration  development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in addition  we are dependent on finding partners for our exploratory activity 
to the extent that others in the industry do not have the financial resources or choose not to participate in our exploration activities  we will be adversely affected 

table of contents we participate in oil and gas leases with third parties and these third parties may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects 
we frequently own less than of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations  and other parties will own the remaining portion of the working interest 
financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling  equipping  completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person 
we could be held liable for joint activity obligations of the other working interest owners such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the other working interest owners 
in addition  the current economic downturn  the credit crisis and the volatility in oil and gas prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners  particularly those that are smaller and less established  are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations 
some of our project partners have experienced liquidity and cash flow problems 
these problems may lead our partners to attempt to delay the pace of drilling or project development in order to preserve cash 
a partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs 
in some cases  a partner may declare bankruptcy 
in the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs  we would likely have to pay those costs  and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
we have substantial capital requirements that  if not met  may hinder operations 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital needs as a result of our active exploration  development and acquisition programs 
we expect that additional external financing will be required in the future to fund our growth 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  and financing under our existing revolving credit facility or new credit facilities may not be available in the future 
even if additional capital becomes available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
as in the past  without additional capital resources  we may be forced to limit or defer our planned oil and gas exploration and development drilling program by releasing rigs or deferring fracturing  completion and hookup of the wells to pipelines and thereby adversely affect our production  cash flow  and the recoverability and ultimate value of our oil and gas properties  in turn negatively affecting our business  financial position and results of operations 
the risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we have demands on our cash resources  including interest expense  operating expenses and funding of our capital expenditures 
our level of debt  the demands on our cash resources and the provisions of our revolving credit facility  the huntington facility  our convertible senior notes and our senior notes may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results  including placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do  limiting our financial flexibility  including our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends  make certain investments and issue equity on favorable terms or at all  limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  increasing our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings if interest rates increase  requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  requiring us to modify our operations  including by curtailing portions of our drilling program  selling assets  reducing our capital expenditures  refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing  which may be on unfavorable terms  and making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy 
in addition  the provisions of our revolving credit facility  the huntington facility and our senior notes place restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to incurring additional indebtedness and liens  making dividends and other payments to shareholders  repurchasing or redeeming our common stock  redeeming our senior notes  making investments  acquisitions  mergers 
table of contents and asset dispositions  entering into hedging transactions and other matters 
our revolving credit facility and the huntington facility also require that specified financial ratios be maintained 
although we currently believe that all of these financial covenants can be met with the business plan that we have put in place  our business plan and our compliance with these covenants are based on a number of assumptions  the most important of which is relatively stable natural gas prices at economically sustainable levels 
if the price that we receive for our natural gas production deteriorates significantly from current levels it could lead to lower revenues  cash flow and earnings  which in turn could lead to a default under certain financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility  including the covenants related to working capital and the ratios described above 
pursuant to the revolving credit facility  we are subject to financial ratio covenants which include  but are not limited to  the maintenance of the following financial covenants a total net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the revolving credit facility ratio of not more than a to for any fiscal quarter ending on or after march  and on or before december   b to for any fiscal quarter ending on or after march  and on or before june  and c to for any fiscal quarter ending on or after september   a current ratio of not less than to  a senior debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to  and an ebitda to interest expense ratio of not less than to 
in order to provide a further margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants  we may seek to further reduce our capital expenditure plan  sell additional non strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our revolving credit facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies  or if executed  that they will be sufficient to avoid a default under our revolving credit agreement if a precipitous decline in natural gas prices were to occur in the future 
the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and the borrowing base under the huntington facility may be reduced below the amount of borrowings outstanding under those facilities 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semi annually based in part on prevailing oil and gas prices 
a negative adjustment could occur if the estimates of future prices used by the banks in calculating the borrowing base are significantly lower than those used in the last redetermination 
the next redetermination of our borrowing base is scheduled to occur in may the portion of our borrowing base made available to us is subject to the terms and covenants of the revolving credit facility including  without limitation  compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility 
in the event the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings 
we may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell a portion of our assets 
under the terms of the huntington facility  availability under each of the term loan facility and the cost overrun facility are subject to borrowing bases that are generally based on consolidated cash flow and debt service projections for carrizo uk 
these borrowing bases are subject to redetermination at least semi annually  with the next redetermination of the borrowing bases scheduled to occur in may in the event the outstanding principal balance under the huntington facility term loan facility and cost overrun facility exceeds the aggregate borrowing base for such facility at any time as a result of a redetermination of such facility s borrowing base  carrizo uk will be obligated to make a payment to cure the deficiency within five business days 
carrizo uk may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment 
if carrizo uk does not have sufficient funds and is otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of its borrowings or arrange new financing  it may default under the huntington facility 
we have in the past identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  and the identification of any material weaknesses in the future could affect our ability to ensure timely and accurate financial statements 
at the end of several periods during the last five years  our management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
the public company accounting oversight board has defined a material weakness as a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
accordingly  a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors 
although we have taken actions to remediate the past material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  these measures may not be sufficient to ensure that our internal controls are effective in the future 
in addition  our history of material weaknesses  any future material weaknesses  or any failure to effectively address a material weakness or other control deficiency or implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could limit our ability to obtain financing  harm our reputation  disrupt our ability to process key components of our results of operations and financial position timely and accurately and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations under rules of the sec and nasdaq stock market llc and our various debt arrangements 

table of contents we have limited experience drilling wells in the marcellus shale and less information regarding reserves and decline rates in the marcellus shale than in other areas of our operations 
we may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill and or operate our marcellus shale wells 
we have limited exploration experience and no development experience in the marcellus shale 
as of december   we have participated or are participating in the drilling of only gross net wells in the marcellus shale area 
other operators in the appalachian basin have significantly more experience in the drilling of marcellus shale wells  including the drilling of horizontal wells 
as a result  we have less information with respect to the ultimate recoverable reserves and the production decline rate in the marcellus shale than we have in other areas in which we operate 
moreover  the recent growth in exploration in the marcellus shale has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups  regulatory agencies and other governmental entities 
as a result  we may face significant opposition to  or increased regulation of  our operations that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain permits and other needed authorizations to operate  result in operational delays  or otherwise make operating more costly or difficult than operating elsewhere 
if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our marcellus shale drilling operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules  our ability to produce gas commercially and in commercial quantities could be impaired 
as with all of our resource plays  we use a substantial amount of water in our marcellus shale drilling operations 
our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water  or treat and dispose of water after drilling  could adversely impact our marcellus shale operations 
moreover  the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste  including  but not limited to  produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of natural gas 
furthermore  future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal  storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could increase operating costs and cause delays  interruptions or termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted  all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial performance 
we may not increase our acreage positions in areas with exposure to oil  condensate and natural gas liquids 
if we are unable to increase our acreage position in the niobrara or eagle ford shale  this may detract from our efforts to realize our growth strategy in crude oil and liquids rich plays  which was announced in april additionally  we may be unable to find or consummate other opportunities in these areas or in other areas with similar exposure to oil  condensate and natural gas liquids on similar terms or at all 
we have limited experience drilling wells in the niobrara and in the eagle ford shale and less information regarding reserves and decline rates in these shale formations than in other areas of our operations 
we have limited exploration and development experience in the niobrara and in the eagle ford shale 
we have participated in the drilling of three horizontal gross net wells in the niobrara and have participated in five horizontal gross net wells in the eagle ford shale 
other operators in these areas have significantly more experience in the drilling of wells  including the drilling of horizontal wells 
as a result  we have less information with respect to the ultimate recoverable reserves  the production decline rate and other matters relating to the exploration  drilling and development of the niobrara and the eagle ford shale than we have in other areas in which we operate 
a substantial portion of our reserves is located in an urban area  which could increase our costs of development and delay production 
our current primary core producing area is located in largely urban portions of the barnett shale  which could disproportionately expose us to operational and regulatory risk in that area 
at december   approximately of our proved reserves and approximately of our then current production were located in the barnett shale 
the core of the barnett shale is located in and around the greater dallas fort worth  texas metropolitan area and much of our operations are within the city limits of various municipalities in that region  such as arlington and mansfield  texas 
in such urban or other populated areas  we may incur additional expenses  including expenses relating to mitigation of noise  odor and light that may be emitted in our operations  expenses related to the appearance of our facilities and limitations regarding when and how we can operate 
the process of obtaining permits for drilling or for gathering lines to move our natural gas to market in such areas may be more time consuming and costly than in more rural 
table of contents areas 
in addition  we may experience a higher rate of litigation or increased insurance and other costs related to our operations or facilities in such highly populated areas 
we face strong competition from other oil and gas companies 
we encounter competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and numerous independent oil and gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have been engaged in the oil and gas business much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
we may not be able to conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 
the oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
as others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial cost 
in addition  other oil and gas companies may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations  including those relating to benzene emissions and hydraulic fracturing  and future regulations may be more stringent 
oil and gas operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and government regulations that may change from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  plug and abandonment bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas 
other federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment apply to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations  including drilling fluids and wastewater 
in addition  we may incur costs arising out of property damage  including environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease or relating to third party sites  or injuries to employees and other persons 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs 
we also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
compliance with existing  new or modified laws and regulations could result in substantial costs  delay our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
moreover  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time 
stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and negatively impact our production and operations 
for example  the tceq and the rrc have been evaluating possible additional regulation of air emissions in the barnett shale area  in response to concerns about allegedly high concentrations of benzene in the air near drilling sites and natural gas processing facilities 
these initiatives  or other similar initiatives  could lead to more stringent air permitting  increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local  state  and federal levels 
additionally  the epa is currently evaluating  pursuant to a court mandated settlement  whether to adopt measures to strengthen certain regulations under the caa  including the nsps  mact and residual risk standards  affecting a wide array of air emission sources in the oil and gas industry 
if these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation  it could increase our costs or reduce our production  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells  particularly in unconventional resource plays like the barnett shale  the marcellus shale  the eagle ford shale and the niobrara 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production 
the us congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under that act and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
sponsors of bills currently pending before the us senate and house of representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
proposed legislation would require  among other things  the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings against producers and service providers 
in addition  these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting of hydraulic fracturing operations at the federal level  which could lead to operational delays  increased operating and compliance costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult or commercially impracticable for us to perform hydraulic fracturing  delaying the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing 
additionally  the epa has commenced a comprehensive research study to investigate the potential adverse environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  including on water quality and public health  and a committee of the us house of representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the initial epa study results are expected to be available in late further  in light of the explosion and fire on the drilling rig deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico  as well as recent incidents involving the release of natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the marcellus shale  there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to restrict oil and gas drilling operations in certain locations 
for example  the new york legislature recently approved a temporary moratorium on drilling involving hydraulic fracturing and the governor of pennsylvania has instituted a moratorium on leasing state forest land for gas drilling 
additionally  the new york state department of environmental conservation has ceased issuing exploration and production drilling permits  pending completion of an environmental impact statement regarding hydraulic fracturing  and the uk and eu parliaments have each discussed implementing a drilling moratorium in the uk north sea 
we use hydraulic fracturing extensively and any increased federal  state  local  foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing or offshore drilling  including legislation and regulation in the states of new york and pennsylvania  could reduce the volumes of oil and gas that we can economically recover  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
president obama s fiscal year budget includes proposals that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to united states tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce 
there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of ghg emissions 
the epa has issued a prepublication version of a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources 
in addition  the us congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals to restrict ghg emissions and more than states  either individually or as part of regional initiatives  have begun taking actions to control and or reduce ghg emissions 
while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states or the north sea in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs 
in addition  existing or new laws  regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for natural gas 
see item and item business and properties additional oil and gas disclosures regulation  global climate change for additional information 
our onshore and offshore operations are subject to various operating and other casualty risks that could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues 
the oil and gas business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts  
table of contents mechanical failures  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  geologic formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  releases of toxic gases  and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks in addition to the hazards described above  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from adverse weather conditions 
additionally  the occurrence of other events such as blowouts and oil spills in marine environments can make containment and remediation more difficult and costly than on land 
these conditions can and have caused substantial damage to facilities and interrupted production 
our operations in the uk north sea are dependent upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change affecting these infrastructure facilities could materially harm our business 
we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or may not be available to us in the future 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities or experience reductions in revenue that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions  or result in the loss of properties 
additionally  offshore operations generally involve increased costs and more expansive regulatory requirements as compared to onshore operations 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
we maintain insurance against losses and liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent  however  insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures  which subject us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations  our financial position and our results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures with third parties  including acp ii  reliance and an affiliate of sumitomo corporation 
we may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future 
these third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture  such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture 
the performance of these third party obligations  including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements  is outside our control 
if these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements  our business may be adversely affected 
our joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly  including  for example our joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions  
table of contents our joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture s obligations  leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities  we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners  our joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays  litigation or operational impasses 
the risks described above or the failure to continue our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture  which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our joint venture with reliance contemplates that we will make significant capital expenditures and subjects us to certain legal and financial terms that could adversely affect us 
in  we completed the sale to reliance of of our interests in oil and gas properties in parts of pennsylvania in the marcellus shale for approximately million in cash and the carry commitment 
at that time  we entered into agreements with reliance to form a new joint venture with respect to the interests being purchased by reliance from us and acp ii such that we generally retained a working interest in the acreage and reliance generally owns a working interest 
the agreements under which we formed this joint venture subject us to various risks  limit the actions we may take with respect to our properties and require us to grant rights to reliance that could limit our ability to benefit fully from future positive developments 
the joint venture requires us to make significant capital expenditures 
if we do not timely meet our financial commitments or otherwise do not comply with our joint venture agreements  our rights to participate  exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture will be adversely affected 
reliance s obligation to fund the carry commitment expires with respect to any portion of the carry commitment not utilized by september   subject to certain extensions 
we have agreed to various restrictions on our ability to transfer our properties covered by the joint venture 
additionally  following the expiration of the carry commitment  we are subject to a mutual right of first offer on direct and indirect property transfers for the remainder of a ten year development period through september  subject to specified exceptions 
we have also granted an option to reliance to purchase a as adjusted over time share of acreage in the area of mutual interest purchased directly or indirectly by us after the closing 
this option  which covers substantially all of pennsylvania  is exercisable at our cost plus  in the case of direct property sales  a specified premium  and is subject to specified exceptions 
we serve as operator of the properties covered by this joint venture  with reliance having the right to assume operatorship of of the undeveloped acreage in portions of central pennsylvania beginning as early as september and  for a three year period through september  to purchase all of our interest in such acreage at a specified price 
operations under the joint venture will generally be required to conform to a budget approved by an operating committee that includes representatives of both parties  subject to exceptions  including those for sole risk operations and in the event of defaults by the parties 
the parties have also generally agreed until to forego the ability to conduct sole risk operations and to certain other limits to such operations thereafter 
reliance has substantially greater financial resources than we have and we may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations reliance proposes  thereby reducing our ability to benefit from the joint venture 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues or could create liability for us for the operator s failure to properly maintain the well and facilities and to adhere to applicable safety and environmental standards 
with respect to properties that we do not operate the operator could refuse to initiate exploration or development projects  
table of contents if we proceed with any of those projects the operator has refused to initiate  we may not receive any funding from the operator with respect to that project  the operator may initiate exploration or development projects on a different schedule than we would prefer  the operator may propose greater capital expenditures than we wish  including expenditures to drill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we have funds for  which may mean that we cannot participate in those projects or participate in a substantial amount of the revenues from those projects  and the operator may not have sufficient expertise or resources 
any of these events could significantly and adversely affect our anticipated exploration and development activities 
if our access to markets is restricted  it could negatively impact our production  our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases 
our ability to sell natural gas and or receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines  thereby necessitating delivery by other means  such as trucking  or requiring compression facilities 
such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or gas may have several adverse affects  including higher transportation costs  fewer potential purchasers thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price or  in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time  possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production 
there is currently only limited pipeline and gathering system capacity in the marcellus shale and  to a lesser extent  the barnett shale 
in the barnett shale area  we have several wells that have been drilled and fractured and are awaiting connection to gas gathering systems 
at times  our midstream partner in this area has reported scheduling delays in connecting these wells  which has delayed our additional production 
in addition  delays in upgrading this system in the past have led to increased back pressure at our wells  further contributing to decreased deliverability from them 
historically  we have generally delivered natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short term transportation agreements 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
due to the lack of available pipeline capacity in the barnett shale and the marcellus shale  we have entered into firm transportation agreements for a portion of our production in the barnett shale and marcellus shale in order to assure our ability  and that of our purchasers  to successfully market the gas that we produce 
we may also enter into firm transportation arrangements for additional production in the future 
these firm transportation agreements are more costly than interruptible or short term transportation agreements 
if production in the marcellus shale by oil and gas companies continues to expand  the amount of natural gas being produced by us and others could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in these areas 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for the marcellus shale may not occur for lack of financing 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines 
in such event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those we currently project  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
a portion of our oil and gas production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
our future acquisitions may yield revenues or production that varies significantly from our projections 

table of contents in acquiring producing properties  we assess the recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel  including our executive officers and other key employees  the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have entered into employment agreements with many of our key employees as a way to assist in retaining their services and motivating their performance 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees 
our success will also be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel 
we may experience difficulty in achieving and managing future growth 
we have experienced growth in the past primarily through the expansion of our drilling program 
future growth may place strains on our financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors  possibly negatively affecting our financial position and results of operations 
our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to obtain leases or options on properties  including those for which we have d seismic data  our ability to acquire additional d seismic data  our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects  our ability to develop existing prospects  our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  our ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of our drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  and our access to capital 
we may not be successful in upgrading our technical  operations and administrative resources or in increasing our ability to internally provide certain of the services currently provided by outside sources  and we may not be able to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
our inability to achieve or manage growth may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we may continue to enter into derivative transactions to manage the price risks associated with our production 
our derivative transactions may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from benefiting from increases in prices for oil and gas 
because oil and gas prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as fixed rate swaps  costless collars  puts  calls and basis differential swaps to reduce our exposure to price declines associated with a portion of our oil and gas production and thereby to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of oil and gas 
our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production  thereby providing only partial protection against declines in oil and gas prices 
these arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain 
table of contents circumstances  including instances in which production is less than expected  our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil and gas or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or gas prices 
in addition  the counterparties under our derivatives contracts may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
periods of high demand for field services and equipment and the ability of suppliers to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our oil and gas properties 
during periods when oil and gas prices are relatively high  well service providers and related equipment and personnel may be in short supply 
these shortages can cause escalating prices  delays in drilling and other exploration activities and the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries 
such pressures may increase the actual cost of services  extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to any accidents sustained from the overuse of equipment and inexperienced personnel 
we may record impairments of oil and gas properties that would reduce our shareholders equity 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
accordingly  we capitalize all productive and nonproductive costs directly associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities to cost centers established on a country by country basis 
under the full cost method  the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes may not exceed the cost center ceiling which is equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of  plus the costs of properties not subject to amortization  plus the lower of the cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less related income tax effects 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the cost center ceiling  we recognize the excess as an impairment of oil and gas properties 
this impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce our earnings and shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and gas properties increases during periods of low oil and or gas prices 
in addition  impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues  as further discussed under our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future 
an impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
we recorded non cash impairments of oil and gas properties at the end of  the end of the first quarter of and the end of with respect to our us cost center and at the end of the second quarter of with respect to our uk cost center 
we could incur additional impairments of oil and gas properties in the future  particularly as a result of a decline in oil and or gas prices 
we could lose our ability to use nols that we have accumulated over the years 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
the utilization of such carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain ownership changes  including the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders and our offering of stock during any three year period resulting in an aggregate change of more than in our beneficial ownership 
in the event of an ownership change  section of the code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that can be offset by these carryforwards 
the limitation is generally equal to the product of a the fair market value of our equity multiplied by b a percentage approximately equivalent to the yield on long term tax exempt bonds during the month in which an ownership change occurs 
in addition  the limitation is increased if there are recognized built in gains during any post change year  but only to the extent of any net unrealized built in gains inherent in the assets sold 
as of december   we believe an ownership change occurred in february with an annual limitation of approximately million 
moreover  based on our knowledge of our shareholder ownership  we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred since february that would further limit our ability to utilize our nols 
because our pre change nols are approximately million  we do not believe we have a section limitation on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards as of december  future equity transactions involving the company or shareholders of the company including  potentially  relatively small transactions and transactions beyond our control could cause further ownership changes and therefore a limitation on the annual utilization of nols 
enactment of a pennsylvania severance tax on natural gas could adversely impact our results of operations and the economic viability of exploiting natural gas drilling and production opportunities in pennsylvania 

table of contents legislation has been proposed in the pennsylvania house of representatives for the adoption of a severance tax on the production of natural gas in pennsylvania 
the amount of the proposed tax  which has been supported by the governor  is of the value of the natural gas at wellhead  plus cents per  cubic feet of natural gas severed 
the specific characteristics  including the scope and magnitude  of the tax have not been determined 
a substantial portion of our marcellus shale acreage is located in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
if pennsylvania adopts such a severance tax  it could adversely impact our results of operations and the economic viability of exploiting natural gas drilling and production opportunities in pennsylvania 
we may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies 
we purchase working and revenue interests in the oil and gas leasehold interests upon which we will perform our exploration activities from third parties or directly from the mineral fee owners 
the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not generally available and  in all instances  we forego the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be placed under lease or already placed under lease until the drilling block is assembled and ready to be drilled 
even then  particularly in urban settings  the cost of performing detailed title work can be expensive 
we may choose to forgo detailed title examination by title lawyers on a portion of the mineral leases that we place in a drilling unit or conduct less title work than we have traditionally performed 
as is customary in our industry  we generally rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and before drilling a well on a leased tract 
we  in some cases  perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability or adequacy of the title to us 
the work might include obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered 
in cases involving more serious title problems  the amount paid for affected oil and gas leases can be generally lost  and the target area can become undrillable 
the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled  in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property 
we have risks associated with our foreign operations 
we currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties including  by way of illustration  the recently announced potential uk production tax increases discussed below under the recently announced uk budget includes a production tax increase that could have a material adverse effect on the results of our north sea operations  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
the recently announced uk budget includes a production tax increase that could have a material adverse effect on the results of our north sea operations 
on march   the uk chancellor of the exchequer introduced the uk budget the uk budget includes a production tax increase  raising the existing supplementary charge levied on profits from north sea oil and gas production from 
table of contents to  with effect from march  this charge is in addition to applicable corporation taxes 
if the uk budget is adopted  it will increase the tax burden on our uk production in the future and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our north sea operations 
a portion of our operations is exposed to the additional risk of tropical weather disturbances 
a portion of our production and reserves is located onshore south louisiana and texas 
operations in this area are subject to tropical weather disturbances 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
for example  some of our wells in the gulf coast were shut in following hurricanes katrina and rita in and hurricanes gustav and ike in in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks 
see we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
the threat and impact of terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations 
we cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  either in the short term or in the long term 
uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines and gathering systems  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war

proved developed reserves 
reserves that are both proved and developed 
proved reserves 
has the meaning given to such term in rule a of regulation s x  which defines proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

table of contents the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically  based on prices used to estimate reserves  through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
reserves that are both proved and undeveloped 
pv value 
the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves calculated in accordance with commission guidelines  net of estimated production and future development costs  using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation  without giving effect to non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service  future income tax expense and depreciation  depletion and amortization  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
reasonable certainty 
if deterministic methods are used  reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered 
if probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
a high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not  and  as changes due to increased availability of geoscience geological  geophysical  and geochemical  engineering  and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery eur with time  reasonably certain eur is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease 
recompletion 
the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed 
reserves 
reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible  as of a given date  by application of development projects to known accumulations

table of contents undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
i reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility  based on pricing used to estimate reserves  at greater distances 
ii undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
iii under no circumstances are estimates for undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty 
working interest
