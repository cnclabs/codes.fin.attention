we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our annual report on form k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
through our internal research programs and in conjunction with our collaborators  we are applying our expertise to develop and commercialize therapies designed to exploit the genetic and molecular differences between cancer cells and normal cells 
we are continuing to maximize current commercialization opportunities for nexavar sorafenib tablets  along with our collaborator  bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer  and we seek to enter the hematologic cancer market through the development of carfilzomib  a selective 
table of contents proteasome inhibitor  for the potential treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and solid tumors 
carfilzomib is a mid to late stage compound with the potential for accelerated marketing approval in the united states based on our current clinical trial data and assuming favorable regulatory outcomes 
in addition  we continue to expand our development pipeline  with multiple clinical and preclinical stage product candidates 
our first commercially available product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  being developed with our collaborator bayer is approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
nexavar is a novel  orally available multiple kinase inhibitor and is one of a new class of anti cancer treatments that target both cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through the inhibition of key signaling pathways 
in december  nexavar became the first newly approved drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer in over a decade 
in november  nexavar was approved as the first and is currently the only systemic therapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer 
nexavar is now approved in more than countries worldwide for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer 
in  worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were million 
we and bayer are also conducting clinical trials of nexavar in several important cancer types in addition to advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer  including lung  thyroid  breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
in collaboration with bayer  we initially focused on demonstrating nexavar s ability to benefit patients suffering from a cancer for which there were no or few established therapies 
with the approval of nexavar for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer  the two companies have established the nexavar brand and created a global commercial oncology presence 
in order to benefit as many patients as possible  we and bayer are investigating the administration of nexavar with previously approved and investigational anti cancer therapies in more common cancers  with the objective of enhancing the anti tumor activity of existing therapies through combination with nexavar 
we and bayer are developing and marketing nexavar under our collaboration and co promotion agreements 
we fund of the development costs for nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
with bayer  we co promote nexavar in the united states and share equally in any profits or losses 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer has exclusive marketing rights and we share profits equally 
in japan  bayer funds all product development  and we will receive a royalty on any sales 
our collaboration agreement with bayer will terminate when patents expire that were issued in connection with product candidates discovered under the agreement  or at the time when neither we nor bayer are entitled to profit sharing under the agreement  whichever is latest 
our co promotion agreement with bayer will terminate upon the earlier of the termination of our collaboration agreement with bayer or the date products subject to the co promotion agreement are no longer sold by either party in the united states 
either party may also terminate the co promotion agreement upon failure to cure a material breach of the agreement within a specified cure period 
our collaboration agreement with bayer provides that if we are acquired by another entity by reason of merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or if a single entity other than bayer or its affiliate acquires ownership of a majority of the our outstanding voting stock  and bayer does not consent to the transaction  then for days following the transaction  bayer may elect to terminate our co development and co promotion rights under the collaboration agreement and convert our profit sharing interest under that agreement into a royalty based on any sales of nexavar and other collaboration products 
the applicable royalty rate would be a function of expected profitability of nexavar for the remaining patent life of nexavar 
as of december   the fifth anniversary of the initial regulatory approval of nexavar  in the event of an acquisition transaction  we believe the economic value of a royalty amount should be substantially equivalent to the economic value of the profit share interest for nexavar during the remaining patent life absent such an acquisition transaction 
bayer has informed us they do not agree with this conclusion 
the application of the royalty formula to any transaction that closed prior to the fifth anniversary of the initial regulatory approval of nexavar would have been different  however  and could have substantially reduced the economic value derived from the sales of nexavar to us or our successor  compared to the economic value we would have received absent such an acquisition transaction 
also  either party may terminate the agreement upon days notice within days of specified events relating to insolvency of the other party 
in november  we made a significant move towards achieving our goal of becoming a multi product portfolio company by acquiring proteolix  inc  or proteolix  a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in south 
table of contents san francisco  california 
proteolix focused primarily on the discovery and development of novel therapies that target the proteasome for the treatment of hematological malignancies  solid tumors and autoimmune disorders 
this acquisition  which included carfilzomib  has provided us with an opportunity to expand into the hematological malignancies market 
the aggregate cash consideration paid to former proteolix stockholders at closing was million with another million paid in april upon the achievement of a pre specified milestone 
in addition  we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earn out payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
we have also expanded our development pipeline through the acquisition of rights to development stage novel anti cancer agents 
in november  we entered into an agreement to license worldwide development and commercialization rights to onx  previously known as bgc  from btg international limited  or btg  a london based specialty pharmaceuticals company 
onx is in preclinical development and is believed to work by combining two established approaches to improve outcomes for cancer patients  selectively targeting tumor cells through the alpha folate receptor  which is overexpressed in a number of tumor types  and inhibiting thymidylate synthase  a key enzyme responsible for cell growth and division 
in september  we initiated phase studies of onx in advanced solid tumors  triggering a million milestone payment to btg 
in december  we acquired options to license sb designated by onyx as onx and sb designated by onyx as onx  which are both janus kinase  or jak  inhibitors  from s bio pte ltd  or s bio  a singapore based company 
the activation of jak stimulates blood cell production and the jak pathway is known to play a critical role in the proliferation of certain types of cancer cells and in the anti inflammatory pathway 
onx is in multiple phase studies and onx is in preclinical development 
we have not yet exercised our options to license rights to onx and onx in december  our collaborator  warner lambert company  now a subsidiary of pfizer inc  initiated a phase clinical trial administering pd  a small molecule cell cycle inhibitor resulting from our collaboration that targets a cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk in accordance with our collaboration agreement  we received a million milestone payment from pfizer in our product development pipeline expansion has led us to begin building our presence internationally  with particular focus on europe 
in  we established zug  switzerland as our european headquarters 
international expansion will assist in carrying out various functions relating to product sales  interfacing with regulatory agencies  research and development and management of our clinical and future commercial product supply chain 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  which is principally attributed to a million expense associated with the change in the fair value of the non current contingent consideration liability for amounts payable to former proteolix stockholders upon the achievement of specified regulatory approvals within pre specified timeframes for carfilzomib 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have incurred annual net losses since our inception 
our ability to achieve sustainable profitability is uncertain and is dependent on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the level of patient demand for nexavar  the ability of bayer s distribution network to process and ship product on a timely basis  investments in sales and marketing efforts to support the sales of nexavar  bayer and our investments in the research and development of nexavar  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  revenues  including milestone payments from development and commercialization partnerships  expenses associated with the change in the fair value of the non current contingent consideration liability  and expenditures we may incur to acquire or develop and commercialize carfilzomib and other additional products 
our operating results will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and are difficult to predict 
since inception  we have relied on public and private financings  combined with milestone payments from our collaborators  to fund our operations and may continue to do so in future periods 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients in approved indications  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 

table of contents business highlights in  we continued to execute on our value building strategy by increasing worldwide sales of nexavar  producing cash flow for expansion and strengthening our pipeline 
nexavar margins remained stable year over year  and sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer in countries around the world increased from million in to million in despite pricing pressures in european countries and the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
in september  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ono pharmaceutical co  ltd  or ono 
the agreement grants ono the right to develop and commercialize both carfilzomib and onx for all oncology indications in japan 
we retain development and commercialization rights for all other countries 
if regulatory approval for carfilzomib and or onx is achieved in japan  ono is obligated to pay us double digit royalties on net sales of the licensed compounds in japan 
significant highlights of our product candidates included in december  we presented complete data results from an ongoing pivotal phase b trial  known as the a trial  for carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients 
results demonstrated carfilzomib was well tolerated in heavily pre treated relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients and could be administered at a full dose over prolonged periods of time  even in a very sick patient population for whom all available treatment options have been exhausted and who have multiple comorbidities 
we began enrollment in two phase trials to evaluate the efficacy of carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients 
one trial  referred to as the aspire trial  will evaluate carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone  versus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone alone 
the other trial  referred to as the focus trial  was initiated after seeking protocol assistance scientific advice from the committee for medicinal products for human use of the european medical agency on the development of cafilzomib in the european union 
the focus trial will evaluate carfilzomib monotherapy in refractory multiple myeloma patients in europe using best supportive care as the comparator 
we completed enrollment in two trials to evaluate the efficacy of nexavar in hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  or liver cancer  patients 
one trial  referred to as the space trial  is phase trial which will evaluate nexavar or placebo in combination with transarterial chemoembolization tace performed with drug eluting beads and doxorubicin for patients with intermediate stage hcc 
the other trial  referred to as the storm trial  is a phase clinical trial which will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar as an adjuvant therapy for patients with liver cancer who have undergone resection or loco regional treatment with curative intent 
in early  we also completed enrollment in another phase trial  referred to as the search trial  which will examine nexavar tablets in combination with tarceva erlotinib tablets as a potential new treatment option for patients with advanced hcc 
we also completed enrollment in a phase trial  referred to as the mission trial  which will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar tablets in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced predominantly non squamous nsclc who have failed two or three previous treatments 
in july  we entered into arrangements to lease and sublease additional premises in south san francisco  california  which will consolidate our facilities and serve as our new company headquarters in financial highlights our operating results for the year included revenue from the nexavar collaboration agreement of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in revenue from the nexavar collaboration agreement was driven primarily by an increase in nexavar net sales 
our operating results for the year also included million in license revenue from our license agreement with ono 
total operating expenses for the year were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an expense associated with 
table of contents the increase in the fair value of the non current contingent consideration liability of million for estimated amounts payable to former proteolix stockholders upon the achievement of specified regulatory approvals within pre specified timeframes for carfilzomib and a full year of research and development expenses to further develop carfilzomib 
cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities at december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million at december  cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities remained relatively consistent despite increases in expenses incurred for our continued expansion and the development of carfilzomib 
outlook our initiatives for fiscal year are intended to promote the development of carfilzomib  the growth of nexavar and the growth of our development pipeline 
these initiatives include continuing momentum in the clinical program for carfilzomib and continuing to invest in the development of carfilzomib  for which we expect to submit an nda with the fda as early as mid year we also expect data from the phase focus trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma in the first half of  which will be used to support initial market authorization in the european union 
we expect to continue to support clinical activities for the development of nexavar in liver cancer  breast cancer  colorectal cancer  lung cancer and thyroid cancer 
in  we expect data from several clinical trials  including the phase space trial for patients with intermediate stage hcc  the phase ties trial for patients with her negative breast cancer  and the phase mission trial for patients with non small cell lung cancer 
we also expect to complete enrollment in a phase trial  referred to as the decision trial  which will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar in the treatment of patients with radioactive iodine refractory  locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer 
in addition  south korea will begin reimbursements for nexavar in liver cancer in we expect to continue to invest in the development of our earlier stage product candidates  including onx and onx in  we expect to also evaluate our options to license rights to exclusively develop and commercialize onx and onx for all potential indications in the united states  canada and europe under our development collaboration  option and license agreement with s bio 
we are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals  including healthcare policy changes in the united states and continued government pricing pressures internationally 
we will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business 
the successes we experienced in have helped us execute our strategy and as we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in include assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of marketable securities  revenue from collaboration agreement  multiple element arrangements  the effect of business combinations  fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  goodwill and other intangible assets  fair value of convertible senior notes  research and development expenses  stock based compensation and the provision for income taxes 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents marketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of corporate debt securities  corporate commercial paper  debt securities of united states government agencies  auction rate notes and money market funds and are classified as available for sale securities 
concentration of risk is limited by diversifying investments among a variety of industries and issuers 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with any unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for securities with unobservable quoted market prices  such as the aaa rated auction rate securities collateralized by student loans that are included in our investment portfolio  the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase or decrease in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease or increase in value 
unrealized losses are charged against investment income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to i the extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the cause for the fair value decline  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we do not intend to sell our marketable securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell our marketable securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
available for sale securities with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
the cost of securities sold or the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in the statements of operations 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
revenue from collaboration agreement in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subtopic  collaborative arrangements  we record our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from the collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue in one line item  revenue from collaboration agreement 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the line item revenue from collaboration agreement  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
we and bayer each bear our own us sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these costs related to our us sales force and medical science liaisons are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
bayer recognizes all revenue under the nexavar collaboration and incurs the majority of expenses relating to the development and marketing of nexavar 
we are highly dependent on bayer for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of nexavar and the costs incurred in developing and selling it  in order to accurately report our results of operations 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses 
however  if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
multiple element arrangements beginning in  we account for multiple element arrangements  such as license and development agreements in which a customer may purchase several deliverables  in accordance with accounting standard update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  for these multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each non contingent element based upon the relative selling price of each element 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price  if it exists 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use best estimated selling price besp for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized based on when the basic four revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
changes in assumptions or 
table of contents judgments or changes to the elements in an arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of proteolix in in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
asc topic establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
the consideration paid to acquire proteolix is required to be measured at fair value and included cash consideration and contingent consideration  which are earn out payments that will be paid upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration plus the cash consideration  we assigned the purchase price of proteolix to the fair value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to in process research and development ipr d projects and goodwill 
the determination and allocation of the consideration transferred requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration and intangible assets acquired 
we believe the fair values assigned to our liability for contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these assets and liabilities  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates  the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risk associated with uncertainty  achievement and payment of the milestone events 
in determining the probability of technical and regulatory success  we utilized data regarding similar milestone events from several sources  including industry studies 
we based the time needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates on the current stages of development of the product candidates  resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates and the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate  such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals 
inputs related to the time needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates is highly judgmental as they are not readily determinable because the drug development process can be unpredictable 
we established a discount rate based on future cash flows that would be required by a market participant for similar instruments  based on the estimated cost of capital and the inherent risk premium associated with repayment 
that discount rate  representative of the rate of return required by a market participant  has been determined by us to be  and has been applied to the contingent payment amounts to determine their present values 
changes to any of these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for these assets and liabilities resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  and asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asc topic requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies the criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
our intangible assets and goodwill are determined to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not amortized 
instead they are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred in accordance with asc topic judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators will be based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired 
table of contents assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
convertible senior notes in august  we issued  through an underwritten public offering  million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc subtopic  debt with conversion and other options 
under asc subtopic issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the carrying amount of the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at a effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in our capital structure as well as taking into consideration effective interest rates derived by comparable companies 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and results in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
subsequently  the debt discount is amortized as interest expense through the maturity date of the notes 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation of stock options granted to employees and directors and of employee stock purchase plan shares by estimating the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and amortizing the fair value of the stock based awards granted over the applicable vesting period 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
we estimate expected volatility based upon a combination of historical and implied stock prices 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the expected option term calculation incorporates historical employee exercise behavior and post vesting employee termination rates 
we account for stock based compensation of restricted stock award grants by amortizing the fair value of the restricted stock awards grants  which is the grant date market price  over the applicable vesting period 
net income loss for the years ended december  and includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
the net loss for the year ended december  includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation expense for unvested stock options  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation expense for unvested restricted stock awards  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
all stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  as calculated using the black scholes model 
the option arrangements are subject to periodic remeasurement over their vesting terms 
we recorded compensation expense related to option grants to non employees of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the stock based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december   and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
research and development expense research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  preclinical study expenses  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
preclinical 
table of contents study expenses include  but are not limited to  costs incurred for the laboratory evaluation of a product candidate s chemistry and its biological activities and costs incurred to assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations 
clinical trial expenses include  but are not limited to  investigator fees  site costs  comparator drug costs and clinical research organization costs 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites  cooperative groups and clinical research organizations 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  up front payment amounts are capitalized and expensed as services are performed or as the underlying goods are delivered 
if we do not expect the services to be rendered or goods to be delivered  any remaining capitalized amounts for non refundable up front payments are charged to expense immediately 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
non refundable option payments  including those made under our agreement with s bio  that do not have any future alternative use are recorded as research and development expense 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our total research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material differences between actual amounts and estimates 
however  if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets  and record a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and the amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against most of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we reassess our valuation allowance for deferred income taxes 
we will consider reducing the valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not the benefit of those assets will be realized 
as part of our accounting for the acquisition of proteolix in  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  therefore  
table of contents deferred taxes have been recorded for future non deductible amortization expenses related to intangible assets as a part of the business combination 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
asc also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted this guidance on uncertain tax positions on january  under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are in the process of completing an analysis of our tax credit carryforwards 
any uncertain tax positions identified in the course of this analysis will not impact our consolidated financial statements due to the full valuation allowance 
we are subject to taxation in the us and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
our calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions that is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us taxes  or the various state and foreign jurisdictions  may be materially different from our estimates 
if  based on new facts that arise within a period  we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
interest and penalties are included in tax expense 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar is our only marketed product 
in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the years ended december   and  we reported no product revenue related to nexavar 
nexavar net sales as recorded by bayer were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily from sales in the united states  the european union  asia pacific and other territories worldwide and includes the impact in the us of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act 
contract revenue from collaborations 
contract revenue from collaborations was zero in  million in and zero in contract revenue from collaborations in relates to a milestone fee earned when pfizer initiated phase clinical testing to advance a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement 
nexavar is currently approved in more than countries worldwide for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under collaboration and co promotion agreements 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we and bayer share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide outside of japan and our continued co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and we reimburse bayer for half of those expenditures 
in addition  for sales generated outside of the united states  excluding japan  we reimburse bayer a fixed percentage of sales for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  excluding japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we receive a royalty on net sales of nexavar 

table of contents in the united sates  bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
we compensate bayer for distribution expenses based on a fixed percentage of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
we reimburse bayer for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold in the united states 
in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
we and bayer each bear our own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement consists of our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from our collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all sales of nexavar worldwide 
we record revenue from collaboration agreement on a quarterly basis 
revenue from collaboration agreement is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting the cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs and allocable overhead costs 
reimbursement by bayer of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue are also included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
non us sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses used to derive the revenue from collaboration agreement during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ from these estimates 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses 
however  if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
revenue from collaboration agreement increases with increased nexavar net revenue  or decreases with decreased nexavar net revenue  over and above the associated cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expenses 
increases to the associated costs of goods sold  distribution  selling and general and administrative expenses will decrease revenue from collaboration agreement and decreases to these costs will increase revenue from collaboration agreement 
additionally  prolonged or profound economic downturn may result in adverse changes to product reimbursement and pricing and sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
we expect nexavar sales and bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase as bayer continues to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities outside of the united states  particularly from certain asia pacific countries 
revenue from collaboration agreement was million  million and million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from collaboration agreement is primarily a result of increased net product revenue on sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in net product revenue was adversely impacted by pricing pressures in europe and strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and was partially offset by increased costs to sell  distribute and market in countries around the world  including certain asia pacific countries

we retain development and commercialization rights for all other countries of the world 
in accordance with asu  we identified the license as one of the non contingent deliverables under this agreement with stand alone value 
because vsoe or tpe of selling price for this element was unavailable  we utilized besp to apply the relative selling price method to allocate revenue to this element 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product were sold on a stand alone basis 
therefore  besp for the license is based on discounted future projected cash flows relating to the licensed territory 
revenue allocated to the license of million was recognized in september when all related knowledge and data had been transferred 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  as compared to prior years  were as follows change change for the year ending december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages research and development the increase in research and development expenses compared to is primarily due to increases to further develop carfilzomib  which was acquired in november research and development expenses in also included million in expenses related to the amortization of the million payment made to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an million reimbursement received from ono and by lower expenses for the onx program compared to  when a milestone payment of million was made to btg international limited 
under the terms of the license agreement with ono  a percentage of the global development costs we incur for the development of carfilzomib and onx is reimbursed by ono 
refer to note in the consolidated financial statements for further information 
research and development expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in 
table of contents we expect that bayer and we will continue to invest in the development of nexavar by conducting clinical trials to test nexavar s efficacy in more prevalent tumor types in future periods 
additionally  we expect our research and development activities to include developing carfilzomib and our other product candidates 
the increase in research and development expenses compared to is primarily due to planned increases in the development program for nexavar across additional tumor types  such as thyroid  colorectal and adjuvant liver cancer  as well as increased costs to further develop onx  including a milestone payment of million to btg  partially offset by decreased spending for lung cancer trials 
research and development expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in a significant portion of our total research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing

costs reflected are from the date of acquisition  november   through december  costs include a million upfront payment in fiscal year and million milestone payment in fiscal year made to btg under our development and license agreement 
costs include the nonrefundable upfront payment of million made to s bio under our development collaboration  option and license agreement 
costs include million in expenses related to the amortization of the million payment made to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx the million payment was initially capitalized as prepaid research and development expense and is being amortized as research and development expense each period based on the actual expenses incurred by s bio for the development of onx and onx selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to prior years were as follows change change for the year ending december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to is primarily due to planned increases in spending as a result of the acquisition of proteolix  an increase in external commercial expenses and an 
table of contents increase in employee related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to is primarily due to increased headcount and increased employee related expenses to support nexavar s commercial growth  as well as increased headcount and legal and employee related expenses to support our growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  consulting  advertising and promotion expenses  legal costs  other third party costs  corporate functional expenses and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase due to increases in marketing expenses related to nexavar and increases in personnel due to preparations for the potential launch of carfilzomib 
contingent consideration expense 
contingent consideration expense  as compared to prior years  was as follows change change for the year ending december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages contingent consideration as a result of the acquisition of proteolix in november under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  or the merger agreement  which was entered into in october  we made a payment of million in april and may be required to pay up to an additional million payable in up to four earn out payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals for carfilzomib in the us and europe within pre specified timeframes 
in january  we entered into amendment no 
to the merger agreement  or the amendment 
under the original merger agreement  the first of these additional earn out payments would be in the amount of million if achieved by the date originally contemplated  and would be triggered by accelerated marketing approval for carfilzomib in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma 
this obligation is unchanged in the amendment 
the amendment modifies this payment if the milestone is not achieved by the date originally contemplated on a sliding scale basis  as follows if accelerated marketing approval in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma is achieved after the date originally contemplated  but within six months of the original date  subject to extension under certain circumstances  then the amount payable will be reduced to million  and if accelerated marketing approval in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma is achieved more than six months after the date originally contemplated  but within months of the original date  subject to extension under certain circumstances  then the amount payable will be reduced to million 
the remaining earnout payments will continue to become payable in up to three additional installments as follows million would be triggered by marketing approval in the european union for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma  million would be triggered by marketing approval in the united states for relapsed multiple myeloma  and million would be triggered by marketing approval for relapsed multiple myeloma in the european union 
we recorded a non current liability for the contingent consideration related to the four remaining earn out payments with a fair value of million at december  based upon a discounted cash flow model that uses significant estimates and assumptions  including the probability of technical and regulatory success ptrs of the product candidate  carfilzomib 
contingent consideration expense is due to the change in the fair value of the recognized amount of the non current liability for contingent consideration 
for the year ended december   the increase in the fair value of the non current liability primarily resulted from a million increase due to a change in the ptrs in the second quarter of  partially offset by a benefit recorded as a result of the 
table of contents amendment 
in june  positive data was presented for the carfilzomib trial  a phase b multicenter dose escalation study of carfilzomib plus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients 
in july  positive data was also presented for the a carfilzomib trial  an open label  single arm phase b study of single agent carfilzomib in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients 
the data from the and a trials positively impacted the ptrs 
the remaining increase in the fair value of the non current liability for contingent consideration resulted from an million increase due to the passage of time 
any further changes to these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for this liability resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
investment income  net 
investment income consists of interest income and realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments 
we had investment income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the same period in these decreases were primarily due to lower effective interest rates in the market as well as a change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio 
excluding restricted cash of million attributable primarily to the escrow account for the acquisition of proteolix  which was paid to former proteolix stockholders in february  our average cash balances in decreased by million from  primarily as a result of a million payment to former proteolix shareholders in april for the achievement of a development milestone  a million payment to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx and a million interest payment on our notes  which were partially offset by million in license revenue received from ono 
we had investment income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the same period in these decreases were primarily due to lower effective interest rates in the market as well as a change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio

interest expense 
interest expense of million in primarily relates to the notes issued in august  and includes non cash imputed interest expense of million as a result of the application of asc subtopic other expense 
other expense of million in primarily relates to net losses on certain foreign currency option contracts that were entered into in july and october these foreign currency option contracts are measured at fair value 
any changes to the fair value of foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments flow through earnings and are recorded in the line item other expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million and a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively  related to continuing operations 
in  our benefit for income taxes primarily related to our election to carryback net operating losses under the worker  homeownership and business association act of the election enabled the company to eliminate all federal alternative minimum taxes amt previously recorded in in and  our tax expense was related primarily to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million 
these net operating losses can be utilized to reduce future taxable income  if any 
approximately million of the federal and million of the state valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards representing the stock option deduction arising from activity under our stock option plan  the benefit of which will increase additional paid in capital when realized 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through  and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through and may be subject to certain limitations 
we also had research tax credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million 
table of contents for federal income tax purposes that expire beginning in through and million for california income tax purposes that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
as a result of these provisions  utilization of our net operating losses would be limited in the event of any future significant ownership changes 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before utilization

acquired in process research and development intangible assets for in process research and development  or ipr d  consist of product candidates resulting from our acquisition of proteolix  including carfilzomib  onx and onx we determined that the combined estimated fair values of carfilzomib  onx and onx was million as of november   or the acquisition date 
we used an income approach  which is a measurement of the present value of the net economic benefit or cost expected to be derived from an asset or liability  to measure the fair value of carfilzomib and a cost approach to measure the fair values of onx and onx under the income approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after tax cash flows excess earnings attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 
under the cost approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the costs incurred to date to develop the asset to its current stage 
to calculate fair value of carfilzomib under the income approach  we used probability weighted cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with this type of asset 
we estimated the fair value of this asset using a present value discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of proteolix 
this is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for proteolix s operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value this asset 
cash flows were generally assumed to extend either through or beyond the patent life of the asset  depending on the circumstances particular to the asset 
in addition  we compensated for the phase of development for this program by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows 
we believe that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions 
the projected cash flows from this project were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the project considering its stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate  the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
the resultant probability weighted cash flows were then discounted using a rate we believe is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption 
for the other two intangible assets acquired  onx and  we used the costs incurred to date by proteolix to develop these assets to their current stage as their fair value as result of the lack of financial projections for these assets in their current development stages 
these ipr d programs represent proteolix s incomplete research and development projects which had not yet reached technological feasibility at acquisition 
a summary of these programs and estimated fair values at the acquisition date is as follows

liquidity and capital resources with the exception of the profitability we achieved for the years ended december  and  we have incurred significant annual net losses since our inception and have relied primarily on public and private financing  combined with milestone payments we received from our collaborators  to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million  excluding million of restricted cash  compared to million at december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a million payment to former proteolix shareholders in april for the achievement of a development milestone  a million payment to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx and a million interest payment on our notes  which were partially offset by million in license revenue received from ono 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million  excluding million of restricted cash  compared to million at december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds raised by our notes and equity financings in august and cash from operations of million  partially offset by our cash payment  net of cash acquired  of million to former proteolix stockholders in conjunction with our acquisition of proteolix in november and a milestone payment to btg

please refer to note  facility leases  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
capital expenditures in and were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
at december   our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities that are collateralized by student loans 
in january  million in securities were redeemed at par and  accordingly  we classified these securities as current marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the remaining balance of million of par value auction rate securities is currently outstanding in our investment portfolio 
since february  these types of securities have experienced failures in the auction process 
however  a limited number of these securities have been redeemed at par by the issuing agencies 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these 
table of contents securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified the auction rate securities with a par value of million as non current marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined the fair value to be million for these securities  based on a discounted cash flow model  and have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income loss instead of earnings because we have deemed the impairment of these securities to be temporary 
further adverse developments in the credit market could result in an impairment charge through earnings in the future 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of the assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
currently  we believe these investments are not other than temporarily impaired as all of them are substantially backed by the federal government  but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled 
we do not intend to sell the securities and we believe it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
we believe that  even after reclassifying these securities to non current assets and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash and current marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs beyond we anticipate our operating costs to increase in as we continue to incur expenses towards the development of carfilzomib  onx and onx in addition  the terms of the agreement and plan of merger for proteolix provide that we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earn out payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
in july  we entered into arrangements to lease and sublease a total of approximately  square feet located at east grand avenue  south san francisco  california and anticipate that we will incur cash outlays associated with the lease and sublease of these premises 
the total monthly base rent in the first year for both the lease and sublease was approximately  beginning in september the total obligations under both of these operating leases will be approximately million 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations beyond however  if we change our development plans  including acquiring or developing additional product candidates or complementary businesses  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
we anticipate that we will incur cash outlays to conduct and support additional clinical trials both currently underway and planned for the development of carfilzomib and our other development candidates 
we also expect to incur cash outlays as we prepare for a potential commercial launch of carfilzomib  should it receive marketing approval 
if we exercise one or both of our options  onx and onx  we will be required to pay significant license fees and will incur development expenses 
further  we may be obligated to make up to an additional million of contingent earn out payments upon the achievement of regulatory approvals for carfilzomib in the us and europe  payable in either cash or common stock  at our discretion 
the terms of the development and license agreement dated november  with btg provide that we may be required to make payments to btg of up to million upon the attainment of certain global development and regulatory milestones  plus additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain marketing approvals and commercial milestones 
while most of our anticipated development costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the funding of our product development programs and our development plans in future periods beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
under our policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline or increase  respectively  by approximately million 
additionally  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in market interest rates for the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our investment income for the year ended december  
table of contents the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months our notes  with a total par value of million at december   bear interest at a fixed rate of 
due to the fixed interest rate  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price which may make the conversion of our notes to common stock beneficial to the holders of such notes 
conversion of the notes currently would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share 
liquidity risk at december   our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated auction rate securities collateralized by student loans 
in january  million in securities were redeemed at par and  accordingly  we classified these securities as current marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the remaining balance of million of par value auction rate securities is currently outstanding in our investment portfolio 
since february  securities of this type have experienced failures in the auction process 
however  a limited number of these securities have been redeemed at par by the issuing agencies 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified the auction rate securities with a par value of million as non current marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined the fair value to be million for these securities  based on a discounted cash flow model  and have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income loss instead of earnings because we have deemed the impairment of these securities to be temporary 
we do not intend to sell the securities and we believe it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of nexavar sales are generated outside of the united states  and a significant percentage of nexavar commercial and development expenses are incurred outside of the united states 
our revenue from collaboration agreement is dependent on these foreign currency denominated activities 
in addition  we incur research and development and general and administrative expenses outside of the united states 
as a result of these underlying non us dollar denominated activities  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies that we are exposed to are the euro and the japanese yen 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in exchange rates between the euro versus the us dollar during the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our net income based on our expected exposures 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in exchange rates between the japanese yen versus the us dollar during the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our net income based on our expected exposures 
for these currencies  we utilize average exchange rates for the reporting period 
as we expand  we could be exposed to exchange rate fluctuation in other currencies 
exchange rates between foreign currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
commencing in the third quarter of  we established a foreign currency hedging program 
the objective of the program is to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising from transactions or cash flows that have a direct or underlying exposure in 
table of contents non us dollar denominated currencies in order to reduce volatility in our cash flow and earnings 
currently  we hedge a certain portion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure with options  typically no more than one year into the future 
these derivative instruments  which include derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges under asc  derivatives and hedging  are intended to reduce the effects of variations in our cash flow resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  in certain circumstances  these derivative instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss 
our cash flows are denominated in us dollars
