narrative description of business 
we manufacture and sell railcars and railcar parts in addition to leasing railcars to our customers through our integrated business model  which includes a captive leasing business  trinity industries leasing company tilc 
we also manufacture and sell inland barges  structural wind towers  concrete and aggregates  highway products  tank containers  and a variety of steel parts and components 
we serve our customers through the following five business groups rail group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our rail group is the leading freight railcar manufacturer in north america trinity rail group or rail group 
we provide a full complement of railcars used for transporting a wide variety of liquids  gases  and dry cargo 
trinity rail group offers a complete array of railcar solutions to our customers

intermodal cars intermodal cars transport intermodal containers and trailers  which are generally interchangeable among railcars  trucks  and ships 
specialty cars specialty cars are designed to address the special needs of a particular industry or customer  such as waste hauling gondolas  side dump cars  and pressure differential cars used to haul fine grain food products such as starch and flour 
tank cars tank cars transport products such as liquefied petroleum products  alcohol and renewable fuels  liquid fertilizer  and food and grain products such as vegetable oil and corn syrup 
we produce the widest range of railcars in the industry allowing us to capitalize on changing industry trends and developing market opportunities 
we also provide a variety of railcar components primarily for the north american market from our plants in the united states and mexico 
we manufacture and sell railcar parts used in manufacturing and repairing railcars  such as couplers  axles  and other devices 
we also have two repair and coating facilities located in texas 
our customers include railroads  leasing companies  and industrial shippers of products  such as utilities  petrochemical companies  grain shippers  agricultural product companies  and major construction and industrial companies 
we compete against five major railcar manufacturers in the north american market 

table of contents for the year ended december   we shipped approximately  railcars  or approximately of total north american railcar shipments 
as of december   our rail group backlog was approximately million consisting of approximately  railcars  including million in orders from the railcar leasing and management services group leasing group 
the total amount of orders in our backlog dedicated to the leasing group was supported by lease commitments with external customers 
we hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components 
we believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances 
no material revenues are received from licensing of these patents 
railcar leasing and management services group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily tilc  and a majority owned subsidiary  trip rail holdings llc trip holdings  we provide operating leases for tank cars and freight cars 
as a provider of leasing and management services  our leasing group is an important strategic resource that uniquely links our rail group with our customers 
trinity s rail group and tilc coordinate sales and marketing activities under the registered trade name trinityrail  thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads and shippers seeking solutions to their rail equipment and service needs 
our railcars are leased to industrial shippers and railroads 
these companies operate in the petroleum  chemical  agricultural  and energy industries  among others 
substantially all of our railcars are manufactured by our rail group 
the terms of our railcar leases generally vary from one to twenty years and provide for fixed monthly rentals 
a small percentage of our fleet is leased on a per diem basis 
as of december   the lease fleet of our wholly owned subsidiaries included approximately  owned or leased railcars that were utilized 
of this total  approximately  railcars were owned by tilc and approximately  railcars were financed in sale leaseback transactions 
trip holdings lease fleet included approximately  owned railcars that were utilized as of december  in addition  we manage railcar fleets on behalf of third parties 
we believe our railcar fleet management services complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income  strengthening customer relationships  and enhancing the view of trinity as a leading provider of railcar products and services 
our railcar leasing business competes against a number of well established entities that are also in the business of leasing railcars 
construction products group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our construction products group produces concrete and aggregates and manufactures highway products as well as other steel products for infrastructure related projects 
many of these lines of business are seasonal and revenues are impacted by weather conditions

we also distribute construction aggregates  such as crushed stone  sand and gravel  asphalt rock  and recycled concrete in several regions of texas as well as smaller operations in arkansas and louisiana 
our aggregates customers are primarily other concrete producers and paving contractors 
we compete with ready mix concrete producers and aggregate producers located in the regions where we operate 
our highway products business is the leading full line producer of guardrails  crash cushions  and other protective barriers that dissipate the force of impact in collisions between vehicles and fixed roadside objects in north america 
based on revenues  we believe we are the largest highway guardrail manufacturer in the united states  with a comprehensive nationwide guardrail supply network 
the federal highway administration  which determines which products are eligible for federal funds for highway projects  has approved most of our products as acceptable permanent and construction zone highway hardware according to requirements of the national cooperative highway research program 
our crash cushions and other protective barriers include multiple proprietary products manufactured through various product license agreements with certain public and private research organizations and inventors 
we hold patents and are a licensee for certain of our guardrail and end treatment products which enhances our competitive position for these products 

table of contents we sell highway products in canada  mexico  and all of the united states 
we compete against several national and regional guardrail manufacturers 
we also export our proprietary highway products to more than countries worldwide 
inland barge group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our inland barge group is the leading manufacturer of inland barges in the united states and the largest manufacturer of fiberglass barge covers 
we manufacture a variety of dry cargo barges  such as deck barges  and open or covered hopper barges that transport various commodities  such as grain  coal  and aggregates 
we also manufacture tank barges used to transport liquid products 
our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges 
our four barge manufacturing facilities are located along the united states inland river systems  allowing for rapid delivery to our customers 
our inland barge group backlog as of december  was approximately million 
our primary inland barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies 
many companies have the capability to enter into  and from time to time do enter into  the inland barge manufacturing business 
we strive to compete through operational efficiency  timely delivery  and quality products 
energy equipment group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our energy equipment group manufactures structural wind towers  tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels  tank heads for non pressure vessels  propane tanks  and utility  traffic  and lighting structures  along with power transmission poles 
we are a leading manufacturer of structural wind towers in north america for use in the wind energy market 
these towers are manufactured in the united states and mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers 
our customers are generally turbine producers 
our structural wind towers backlog as of december  was approximately billion 
we are a leading manufacturer of tank containers and tank heads for pressure and non pressure vessels 
we manufacture tanks in the united states and mexico 
we market a portion of our products in mexico under the brand name of tatsa 
we manufacture tank heads  which are pressed metal components used in the manufacturing of many of our finished products as well as pressure rated or non pressure rated tank heads  depending on their intended use 
we use a significant portion of the tank heads we manufacture in the production of our tank cars and containers 
we also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers 
there is strong competition in the tank heads business 
we manufacture propane tanks that are used by industrial plants  utilities  residences  and small businesses in suburban and rural areas 
we also manufacture fertilizer containers for bulk storage  farm storage  and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia 
our propane tank products range from nine gallon tanks for motor fuel use to  gallon bulk storage spheres 
we sell our propane tanks to propane dealers and large industrial users 
in the united states we generally deliver the containers to our customers who install and fill the containers 
our competitors include large and small manufacturers of tanks 
we manufacture utility  traffic  and lighting structures  which are used principally by municipalities  and various other local and state governmental entities 
we also manufacture transmission structures to be used in the erection of private and public electric transmission lines 
these structures are manufactured in the united states and mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers 
there are a number of well established entities that actively compete with us in the business of manufacturing energy equipment including several domestic and foreign manufacturers of structural wind towers for the north american market 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  legal  environmental  and upkeep costs associated with non operating facilities  other peripheral businesses  and the change in market valuation related to ineffective commodity hedges 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are primarily located in mexico 
continuing operations included sales to foreign customers  primarily in mexico  which represented   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  
table of contents and  we had approximately and  respectively  of our long lived assets not held for sale located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars  propane tank containers  tank heads  structural wind towers  and other parts at our mexico facilities for local consumption as well as for export to the united states and other countries 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations  social unrest  and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of these factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december  and  our backlog was approximately as follows as of december  in millions rail group external customers leasing group inland barge structural wind towers the total amount of orders in our backlog dedicated to the leasing group was supported by lease commitments with external customers 
approximately of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  with the remainder in the majority of our backlog for barges is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  for multi year barge orders  the deliveries for are included in the backlog at this time  deliveries beyond are not included in the backlog if specific production quantities for future years have not been determined 
approximately of our backlog for structural wind towers is expected to be delivered in with the remainder to be delivered evenly over and marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple locations in the united states as well as canada  mexico  the united kingdom  singapore  and sweden 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components and steel 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components and steel purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least two suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
market steel prices continue to exhibit short periods of volatility and ended significantly higher than generally  we are able to mitigate a majority of this volatility through contract specific purchasing practices and existing supplier commitments 
steel prices may continue to be volatile in part as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and other market factors 
we often use contractual price escalation provisions and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of this volatility  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 

table of contents in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas  arkansas  and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
cement 
cement required for the concrete and aggregates business is received primarily from texas and overseas 
in  the supply of cement was sufficient in our markets to meet demand 
we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
employees 
the following table presents the approximate headcount breakdown of employees by business group december  business group rail group construction products group inland barge group energy equipment group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states and approximately  employees were employed in mexico 
acquisitions and divestitures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities  whether owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in  or modified interpretations of  existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

table of contents in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation 
railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the united states environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry and rail interchange  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the united states coast guard  the united states national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents  and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
highway products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products business are the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and specifications  we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
we believe that our highway products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration and the united states mine safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 

table of contents other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

risk factors 
there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those mentioned in forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
all known material risks and uncertainties are described below 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
we undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
negative global economic conditions could cause a decrease in our revenues or an increase in our operating costs  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
if global economic conditions experience a downturn  many of our customers may delay or otherwise reduce their purchases of railcars  barges  wind towers  and other products and services 
if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers access to credit  product order volumes may decrease which could result in lower revenues 
likewise  if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit  in selling their products  or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products 
these actions could result in reductions in our revenues  increased price competition  or increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 
negative global economic conditions may lead to cancellations or delays in our backlog 
the lack of stability in the global economy  prevailing conditions in the global credit markets  volatility in the ethanol industry  changes in legislative policy  and or adverse changes in the financial condition of certain third party lessees could possibly lead to cancellations or delays of backlog orders 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes  lower prices  and or a loss of profits 
the railcar  barge  and wind energy industries have previously experienced deep down cycles and at such times operated with a minimal backlog 
the economic and financial crisis experienced by the united states economy since has impacted our businesses 
new orders for railcars and barges dropped significantly in as the transportation industry experienced a significant decline in the shipment of freight 
the transportation industry experienced weakness 
table of contents throughout and began to improve in orders and deliveries for structural wind towers have been slow since mid when green energy companies encountered tightened credit markets coupled with lower prices for electricity and natural gas sales 
the slowdown in the residential and commercial construction markets impacted our construction products group as well 
we continually assess our manufacturing capacity and take steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products 
as a result of our assessment  we have adapted to the rapid decline in market conditions by reducing our production footprint and staffing levels and by causing certain facilities to be on non operating status 
to the extent that demand for our products increases  non operating facilities are available for future operations 
litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we are currently  and may from time to time be  involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
adverse outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in judgments against us for significant monetary damages that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we seek contractual recourse and indemnification in the ordinary course of business  maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability  and purchase liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries in an effort to mitigate our liability exposures 
nevertheless  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of claims or judgments 
any such claims or judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel and other component parts could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
market steel prices continue to exhibit short periods of volatility and ended significantly higher than we were able to mitigate the majority of this volatility through contract specific purchasing practices and existing supplier commitments 
steel prices may continue to be volatile in part as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and other market factors 
we often use contractual price escalation provisions and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of this volatility  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in our supply chain to meet current production level demands 
we believe our existing contracts and commercial relationships will supply our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities  whether owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in  or modified interpretations of  existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

table of contents in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence  if any  of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
we may not be able to sustain our market leadership positions which may impact our financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing  product performance and service is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce our revenues and operating profits  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
if we are unable to obtain refinancing for existing debt as it matures or if our railcar leasing subsidiaries are unable to obtain acceptable long term financing of their railcar lease fleet  our lenders may foreclose on the portion of our lease fleet that secures our warehouse facilities 
in general  the ability to refinance maturing debt is significant to our leasing group s operations 
tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a non recourse warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from our rail manufacturing business 
trinity rail leasing warehouse trust trlwt  a qualified subsidiary of tilc  is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through february  and  unless  renewed  any amounts outstanding would be payable in three equal installments in august  february  and august trip holdings wholly owned subsidiary  trip rail leasing llc trip leasing  entered into a billion warehouse loan agreement  which is non recourse to trinity  to finance the purchase of its railcar fleet 
this warehouse loan had a two year revolving availability period which ended in june under the agreement a majority of the lenders have the right to compel trip leasing to commence repayment of its outstanding borrowings in four quarterly installments commencing june and ending march in the event such action is taken  it is not expected that trip leasing will be able to make such payments from its anticipated cash balances and net cash flow from operations prior to the initial installment due date 
trip leasing is considering a number of financing alternatives to address these quarterly installments 
if trip leasing is unable to achieve such alternatives to the satisfaction of the trip warehouse loan s lenders  the company s investment in trip holdings may become impaired 
see note investment in trip holdings in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under these warehouse loan agreements are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
a decline in the value of the railcars respectively securing borrowings under these warehouse loan agreements or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases could reduce trlwt s or trip leasings leasing subsidiaries ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time the leasing subsidiaries purchase railcars with short term borrowings under their respective warehouse loan agreements and the time they obtain permanent financing for such railcars could decrease our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if either or both of these leasing subsidiaries are unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under their respective warehouse loan agreements  the lenders under the warehouse loan agreement may foreclose on the portion of such leasing subsidiaries lease fleet pledged to secure its loan facility or trinity may decide to take such actions as might be necessary to resolve such financing issues 
as of december  there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million was available under the tilc warehouse loan facility and billion outstanding under the trip leasing warehouse loan agreement 
we may be unable to re market railcars from expiring leases on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization percentages and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms  or upon lease defaults or bankruptcy filings by third party lessees 
our ability to re lease or sell leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for leases or ownership of newer or specific use models  
table of contents the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of leased railcars  the prevailing market and economic conditions  including the availability of credit  interest rates  and inflation rates  the demand for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  the volume of railcar traffic  and the volume and nature of railcar loadings 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms or newer railcars  requiring us to re market leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease rates  lower lease utilization percentages and reduced revenues 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our railcar related and structural wind towers products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty parts and components at competitive prices such as brakes  wheels  side frames  bolsters  and bearings for the railcar business  as well as flanges for the wind towers business 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our parts and component needs 
specialty parts and components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty parts and components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of two suppliers continue to produce the parts and components we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty parts and components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use various gases  including natural gas  at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  prolonged conflicts could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general 
hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas potentially resulting in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs 
speculative trading in energy futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to product replacement and repair claims 
depending on the product  we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials pursuant to express limited contractual warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part  component or material is highly disproportionate to the original cost 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair or replacement costs  and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage  and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous  toxic  or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability claims and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial 
table of contents norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our production process may exceed our insurance coverage or expose us to the entire damages judgment if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured  contractually indemnified  or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade  economic changes or instability  or social unrest could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar and railcar component part design  performance  and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts and components within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars  parts  and components in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences  and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and agencies  or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies  could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in mexico 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have an employment agreement with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may not be able to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts  and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies  potentially preventing us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials  parts  or components 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry and rail interchange  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the united states national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved 
table of contents safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our construction products group business is subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found to be not in compliance with these standards and specifications  we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration and the united states mine safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation  investigations  or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation  investigations  or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our financial results 
we periodically evaluate for potential impairment the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  or on an interim basis  whenever events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired 
due to an overall market decline for products in the rail group during the second quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
impairment losses related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us 
railcars as a significant mode of transporting freight could decline  become more efficient over time  experience a shift in types of modal transportation  and or certain railcar types could become obsolete 
as the freight transportation markets we serve continue to evolve and become more efficient  the use of railcars may decline in favor of other more economic transportation modalities 
features and functionality specific to certain railcar types could result in those railcars becoming obsolete as customer requirements for freight delivery change 
business  regulatory  and legal developments regarding climate change may affect the demand for our products or the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 
the company has followed the current debate over climate change in general  and the related science  policy discussion  and prospective legislation 
additionally  the potential challenges and opportunities for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed 
however  any such challenges or opportunities are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industries 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company s operations or opportunities 
potential opportunities could include greater demand for wind towers and certain types of rail cars  while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of rail cars and higher energy costs 
further  when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape 

table of contents changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  and our independent registered public accounting firm may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements 
for a further discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes  see critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of our employees belong to labor unions and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our operations in the us and all of our operations in mexico 
disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
we cannot be assured that our relations with our workforce will remain positive or that union organizers will not be successful in future attempts to organize at some of our facilities 
if our workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs 
in addition  we could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with lay offs  shutdowns or reductions in the size and scope of our operations or difficulties of restarting our operations that have been temporarily shuttered 
natural disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  earthquake  flood  or any other natural disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters that could disrupt our business  we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters 
in addition  insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters
