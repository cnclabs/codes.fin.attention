table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview dolby laboratories has partnered with the entertainment industry for more than years 
we provide the products  services  and technologies used to capture and render a superior experience for consumers of entertainment content  regardless of how or where that content is enjoyed 
to achieve this we leverage our core competencies  from expertise in signal processing and compression technology  to our ability to develop and deliver compatible tools and technologies for each stage of the content creation  distribution  and playback process 
specifically  we provide products and services to help content creators encode in our premium formats  deliver the products  tools  and technologies for distributors to support these formats  and license decoding technologies to the manufacturers of entertainment devices to ensure that content is ultimately experienced as the creator and distributor intended 
over the years we have introduced innovations that have significantly improved audio entertainment  such as noise reduction for the recording and cinema industries and surround sound for cinema and home entertainment 
today we derive the vast majority of our revenue from our audio technologies 
looking forward  we see a number of industry trends that create opportunities for the future growth of our audio business  including the ongoing global transition from analog to digital television and the increasing use of portable devices  such as tablets and smart phones  to play back digital content 
we believe our portfolio of technologies and solutions optimize the audio experience for portable devices  providing a rich  clear  and immersive sound  while also meeting the compression needs of the limited bandwidth channels of online and cellular networks 
we see opportunities to extend our core competencies beyond audio solutions 
for example  we believe that significant improvements can be made in the technology currently used to deliver premium video to displays  and that we have identified solutions that can substantially improve the video experience 
similarly  we believe the clarity and quality of voice communications can be improved through the application of our existing audio technologies in areas such as multi party conferencing 
business model we generate revenue by licensing technologies to original equipment manufacturers oem of consumer entertainment ce products and software vendors 
we also generate revenue by selling products and related services to creators and distributors of entertainment content 
we work with the global entertainment industry in three principal ways first  we offer products and services to content creators and distributors  such as studios and television broadcasters  including satellite and cable operators  and increasingly  content streaming and download service providers 
these content creators and distributors use our products  services  and technologies to encode content  creating a rich  clear  and immersive audio experience for consumers 
second  we license our technologies  such as dolby digital  dolby digital plus  and dolby pulse  to oems and software vendors for use with consumer products that decode and play back audio content encoded with our proprietary technologies 

table of contents third  we work directly with standards setting organizations to promote adoption of our technologies in their specifications in order to ensure a common standard across devices and improve the overall consumer experience 
today  our technologies are standard in a wide range of ce products  including virtually all dvd players  blu ray disc players  audio video receivers  and personal computer pc dvd software players 
we license our technologies to oems and software vendors in countries and our licensees distribute products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
additionally  we sell our products and provide services in over countries 
in fiscal   and  revenue from outside of the us was   and of our total revenue  respectively 
geographic data for our licensing revenue is based on the location of our licensees headquarters 
products revenue is based on the destination to which we ship our products  while services revenue is based on the location where services are performed 
opportunities  challenges  and risks our revenue increased in fiscal from fiscal our licensing and products markets are characterized by rapid technological changes  new and improved product introductions  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  changing licensee needs  and product obsolescence 
additionally  as described below  our licensing revenue is subject to uncertainties and market and technology trends relating to market growth as well as the mix of ce products incorporating our technologies 
our licensing business could be affected by adverse changes in general economic conditions because our technologies are incorporated in ce products  many of which are discretionary goods 
furthermore  as described below  our products business and revenue are subject to intense competition and uncertainties relating to the transition to d cinema  and events and uncertainties relating to purchasing decisions by our customers 
our product sales are likely to be materially affected if demand for our d products does not improve 
licensing licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing   and of total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
we categorize our licensing revenue into the following markets items listed in each market incorporate our technologies pc market primarily consists of software dvd players and microsoft windows operating systems broadcast market primarily consists of televisions and set top boxes ce market primarily consists of dvd players and recorders  blu ray disc players  audio video receivers  and home theater in a box systems other markets mobile primarily consists of cell phones and other mobile devices gaming primarily consists of video game consoles licensing services revenue from the administration of joint licensing programs automotive primarily consists of in car dvd players 
the growth of the internet  accompanied by a shift toward online content consumption  has resulted in a global consumer trend toward an array of online streaming and download services 
content creators are increasingly focused on delivering content across a multitude of media and devices with varying bandwidth and performance requirements  including pcs  connected tvs  set top boxes  gaming consoles  connected blu ray disc players  and mobile devices 
many of these devices are increasingly designed to capture and send content through improved camera and wifi technologies  as well as play back rich media experiences 
this increasingly complex array of devices  aimed at both creating and consuming content  presents a challenge for content 
table of contents creators and device manufacturers looking to ensure consistent audio quality 
we believe this challenge provides an opportunity similar to that of digital broadcast  whereby we can deliver the industry solutions to optimize the audio experience across the online and portable device ecosystem 
in the area of content creation and delivery  our technologies are included in dvd  blu ray disc  and certain broadcast standards 
we are working to extend our technologies to online delivery services 
we work with a growing number of online content aggregators  including netflix  amazon  vudu  apple  and the roxio now platform  to encode video and audio content with our technologies 
we also work with leading music services such as rhapsody and omnifone to adopt our audio encoding tools for a rich music experience 
our pc market represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our technologies are common in most pcs today  primarily due to dvd and blu ray disc playback being incorporated into pcs and the inclusion of dolby technologies in the dvd and blu ray disc standards 
over time we have licensed our technologies to a range of pc licensees  including independent software vendors isv  pc oems  and operating system providers 
the release of major operating systems has historically resulted in changes in the mix of our pc licensees 
in microsoft introduced its windows vista operating system  which included our technologies within two of its operating system editions to enable dvd audio playback 
in fiscal microsoft released its current operating system  windows  which includes our technologies within four editions to enable dvd audio playback 
as a result  since the mix of our pc licensing revenue from operating systems has increased relative to that from oems and isvs 
currently  we license our audio codec technologies directly to oems such as apple  toshiba  and sony to support optical disc playback on pcs  and we license our pc entertainment experience pcee technologies to multiple pc oems through our pcee licensing program 
we also license our technologies through isvs such as cyberlink and corel 
we face the risk that microsoft may not include our technologies in the commercial version of the windows operating system or future microsoft operating systems 
if our technologies were not to be included in the commercial version of the windows operating system or future microsoft operating systems  we intend to support the playback of dvd  blu ray disc  broadcast  and online content on pcs by licensing our technologies directly to oems 
given the anticipated release date of windows  we would not expect these changes to have a financial impact until fiscal  as we expect that microsoft will continue to license its windows operating systems with our technologies at least until the release of windows beyond this  the financial impact is uncertain and would depend on several factors  including the extent and rate at which windows is adopted in the marketplace  the extent to which earlier versions of microsoft operating systems  including windows  continue to be licensed after the release of windows  our ability to establish and extend direct licensing relationships with oems and isvs  as we have done in the past  pc oems may not participate in our new licensing program  or they may install our software on fewer pcs  or require aftermarket end user installation  the rate at which disc based media shifts to online media content  resulting in fewer pcs with optical disc drives and declines in pc dvd and blu ray disc players  if we license our technologies on a per device basis  rather than on a per application basis  we will no longer collect multiple royalties per pc  which may impact our results of operations  and our ability to extend the adoption of our technologies in online and mobile platforms 

table of contents in the short term  revenue from our pc market continues to be dependent on several factors  including underlying pc unit shipment growth and the extent to which our technologies are included in operating systems and isv media applications 
licensing revenue from our pc market decreased in fiscal  primarily driven by decreased isv media applications in pc shipments 
we continue to face risks relating to purchasing trends for netbooks  low cost pcs  and tablets  which may not include operating systems or isv media applications with our technologies  unauthorized and infringing pc software with our technologies  for which we do not receive royalty payments  hard disk drive shortages due to the thailand flooding may adversely impact pc sales  the inclusion of our technologies in business oriented editions of windows could result in our technologies residing in a greater percentage of pcs  resulting in substantial discounts and reducing the average per unit royalty we receive from microsoft over time  and certain pc oems have excluded  and we expect others may exclude in the future  isv media applications from their product offerings for windows based pcs  because windows incorporates dvd playback software 
our broadcast market  driven by demand for our technologies in televisions and set top boxes  represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our broadcast market has benefited from increased global shipments in fiscal of digital televisions and set top boxes incorporating our technologies 
we view the broadcast market as an area for potential continued growth  primarily driven by geographic markets outside of the us we also view broadcast services  such as terrestrial broadcast or iptv services  which operate under particular bandwidth constraints  as another area of opportunity for us to offer dolby digital plus  he aac  and dolby pulse  which enable the delivery of high quality audio content at reduced bit rates  thereby conserving bandwidth 
notwithstanding our success in the broadcast market to date  we may not be able to capitalize on these opportunities and actual results may differ from our expectations 
our ce market  driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd players and recorders and blu ray disc players  represented approximately   and of licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
within our ce market in fiscal  we experienced an increase in revenue from blu ray disc players and home theater in a box systems incorporating our technologies 
blu ray disc continues to represent an important source of revenue within our ce market  as blu ray disc players are required to support dolby digital for primary audio content and dolby digital plus for secondary audio content  and dolby truehd is an optional audio standard 
however  there is a risk that revenue from blu ray disc players may not offset future declines in revenue from dvd players and that blu ray disc revenue may also decline 
revenue generated from our other markets  driven by mobile  gaming  licensing services  and automotive  represented approximately   and of licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
mobile revenue in fiscal was primarily driven by demand for the aac  he aac  dolby digital plus  and dolby digital audio compression technologies incorporated into mobile devices  and to a lesser extent by dolby mobile  our suite of post processing technologies optimized for mobile devices 
we view the mobile market as an area of opportunity to increase revenue  however  actual results may differ from our expectations 
revenue from licensing services was primarily driven by demand for standards based audio compression technologies used in broadcast  pcs  ce  and mobile products 
gaming and automotive revenue was primarily driven by sales of video game consoles and in car entertainment systems with dolby digital  aac  dolby digital plus  dolby truehd  and atrac technologies 
consumer entertainment products throughout the world incorporate our technologies 
we expect that sales of products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies  such as brazil  china  india  and russia  will increase as consumers in these markets have more disposable income to purchase entertainment products  
table of contents although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we further expect that oems in lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production of consumer entertainment products in the future to satisfy this increased demand 
additionally  we have seen oems shift product manufacturing to these lower cost manufacturing countries 
there are risks associated with the opportunities of doing business in emerging economies that have affected  and will continue to affect  our operating results  such as oems failing to report or underreporting shipments of products incorporating our technologies 
products products revenue  driven primarily by sales of equipment to cinema operators and broadcasters  represented   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our cinema products represented approximately   and of total products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales of our cinema products tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the cinema industry  including the popularity of individual movies  as cinema owners often purchase equipment to meet expected box office demand 
cinema products revenue in fiscal reflects decreased unit shipments for traditional cinema products  as more exhibitors convert to digital cinema  and also increased competition and promotional pricing for d products 
the cinema industry is in the midst of a transition from traditional film to digital cinema 
we estimate that the cinema industry is approximately halfway through this transition 
digital cinema offers motion picture studios a means to achieve cost savings in printing and distributing movies  to combat piracy  and to enable repeated movie playback without degradation in image and audio quality 
we offer our dolby digital cinema screen server and central library server  which allow for the storage and playback of digital content  as well as our digital audio processor 
we expect most cinema owners who are either constructing new theaters or upgrading existing theaters to choose digital cinema products over traditional film cinema products 
digital cinema specifications are based on open standards which  unlike traditional cinema standards  do not include our proprietary audio technologies 
furthermore  we are facing more pricing and other competitive pressures in the digital cinema products market than we have experienced in our traditional film cinema market 
digital cinema standards are defined by the digital cinema initiative dci specifications 
our currently available digital cinema server software does not comply with the current dci specifications 
we are developing software upgrades and expect to be able to comply with the current dci specifications in the first half of fiscal in the meantime  cinema owners may delay or choose not to purchase our digital cinema products 
if cinema owners do purchase our digital cinema products  they may require contractual provisions that would obligate us to comply with the current dci specifications within that period of time 
if dolby systems are not in compliance within a certain period of time  we may become obligated to the cinema owners  some of whom are existing customers  to replace the non compliant systems with compliant systems 
the transition to digital cinema has been driven in part by the recent transition to d enabled screens  which require digital servers for d playback 
our digital d products provide d image capabilities when combined with a digital cinema projector and server 
while we believe the success of certain d cinema releases has led to the creation and distribution of more d cinema content  we estimate that the cinema industry is in the later stages of this transition 
additionally  the d market has become increasingly competitive  leading to our loss of market share 
we also face risks that our customers maintain excess product inventory levels which could reduce future anticipated sales 
several of our competitors have introduced digital cinema products that support the presentation of movies with higher resolution k digital cinema projectors 
certain major exhibitors have begun installing k digital cinema equipment in their theaters 
in the future  other exhibitors may feel they need to outfit some or all of their theaters with k digital cinema equipment to compete in markets where competitors are promoting k products 

table of contents we currently do not offer a k digital cinema solution  although we are developing one 
if we encounter delays in the development of the solution or if we are unable to provide a solution at a market competitive price  our future prospects in digital cinema may be limited and our business could be adversely affected 
our traditional film cinema products are primarily used to read  decode  and play back a film soundtrack  to calibrate cinema sound systems  and to adapt analog cinema audio systems to digital audio formats 
as the cinema industry has invested more in digital cinema  revenue from our traditional film cinema products has declined 
we expect this decline to continue 
our broadcast products represented approximately   and of products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our broadcast products are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio content for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
in fiscal we began selling our professional reference monitor product  a flat panel video reference display for video professionals 
these professionals use the monitor for color critical tasks  such as calibrating color accuracy to professional reference standards 
our professional reference monitor uses our dynamic range imaging technologies  which enable enhanced contrast  extended brightness  and dynamic range  along with reduced power consumption in led backlit lcd televisions 
we do not anticipate generating significant revenue from this product in fiscal services our services revenue  which represented approximately   and of total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively  is primarily tied to the cinema industry  and in particular  to the number of movies being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
several factors influence the number of movies produced in a given fiscal period  including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry  as well as tax incentive arrangements provided by many governments to promote local filmmaking 
other we are monitoring the situation in thailand in light of the recent flooding to determine any potential risks of disruption which would adversely affect our operating results 
while we are unable to predict the effect of the recent catastrophe  it potentially may adversely affect our licensees global supply chains and our product distributors operations 
the flooding also impacted the facility of a contract manufacturer to which we were transferring manufacturing operations 
we are now planning to transfer manufacturing operations to a different facility and we also are undertaking a contingency plan to increase our available supply of product 
however  we continue to monitor the thailand situation and conditions could worsen 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  and pursuant to securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations 
gaap and sec rules and regulations require us to use accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and or results of operations and requires significant judgment on the part of management in its application 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgment  and estimates 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we consider the following to be critical accounting policies and estimates because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management judgments about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see our risk factors for further information on the potential risks to our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies  trademarks  and know how and to sell products and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution  and other factors 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the revenue recognition accounting standards to exclude sales of qualifying tangible products that contain essential software elements from the scope of the software revenue recognition standards 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this accounting standard for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after september  due to this adoption  we no longer account for product sales that contain software elements under the software revenue recognition standards 
also in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple element me revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether these arrangements exist  how the elements should be separated  and how fees associated with a revenue arrangement arrangement fees should be allocated to each element  require an entity to allocate arrangement fees using the estimated selling price esp of each element if the entity does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the selling price or third party evidence tpe of the selling price  and require a vendor to allocate arrangement fees using the relative selling price method 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the amended accounting standards for me revenue arrangements with qualifying tangible products entered into or materially modified after september  prior to adoption  we were not able to establish vsoe of the standalone selling price for the undelivered support and maintenance elements for a majority of our me arrangements 
the previous accounting standards required vsoe in order to allocate the arrangement fees to each undelivered element 
since we had not established vsoe  we allocated the arrangement fees to the undelivered element and ratably recognized the revenue over the estimated support and maintenance period 
under the new accounting guidance  we allocate the arrangement fees to each element based on its relative selling price  which we establish using a selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price of each element based on its vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we determine our best estimate of the selling price for an individual element within a me revenue arrangement using the same methods used to determine the selling price of an element sold on a standalone basis 
if we sell the element on a standalone basis  we estimate the selling price by considering actual sales prices 
otherwise  we estimate the selling price by considering internal factors such as pricing practices and margin objectives 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies  customer demands  and industry technology lifecycles 
management applies judgment to establish margin objectives  pricing strategies  and technology lifecycles 

table of contents we evaluate each element in a me arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and delivery of an undelivered element is both probable and within our control 
when these criteria are not met  the delivered and undelivered elements are combined and the arrangement fees are allocated to this combined single unit 
our adoption of the amended guidance changed our units of accounting for our revenue transactions with qualifying tangible products by allowing us to use esp  to the extent vsoe or tpe is not available  to allocate the total fees amongst the delivered and undelivered elements in an arrangement 
if the unit separation criteria are met  we account for each element within a me arrangement such as hardware  software  maintenance  and other services separately  and we allocate fees from the arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
for some arrangements  customers receive certain elements over a period of time  after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive upgrades 
revenue allocated to the undelivered element is recognized either over its estimated service period or when the upgrade is delivered 
we do not recognize revenue that is contingent upon the future delivery of products or services or upon future performance obligations 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we have completed all contractual obligations 
we account for the majority of our digital cinema server sales as me arrangements that may include up to three separate units  or elements  of accounting 
the first element consists of our digital cinema server hardware and the accompanying software  which is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
this element is typically delivered at the time of sale 
the second element is the right to receive support and maintenance  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered over a service period subsequent to the initial sale 
the third element is the right to receive specified upgrades  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered when a specified upgrade is available  subsequent to the initial sale 
the application of the new revenue accounting standards to our digital cinema server sales typically results in the allocation of a substantial majority of the arrangement fees to the delivered hardware element based on its esp  relative to the vsoe or esp of the other elements  which we recognize as revenue at the time of sale 
a small portion of the arrangement fees are allocated to the undelivered support and maintenance element  and in some cases to the undelivered specified upgrade element  based on the vsoe or esp of each element 
the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to the support and maintenance element is recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service period and the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to specified upgrades is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the upgrade 
goodwill  intangible assets  and long lived assets we evaluate and test our goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
our operating segments are aligned with the management principles of our business 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value 
if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we move to the second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and if an event occurs or circumstances change such that there is an indication of a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units  which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
during our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the third quarter of fiscal  we had two reporting units via  corresponding to our wholly owned subsidiary  which has no assigned goodwill  and dolby entertainment technology det  with goodwill of million 
the cash flow model was based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs 
we estimated our future revenue by applying growth rates  consistent with those used in our internal 
table of contents forecasts  to our current revenue forecasts 
the revenue and cost estimates were based on several sources  including our historical information  third party industry data  and review of our internal operations 
the cash flow forecasts were adjusted by a discount rate of approximately  based on our weighted average cost of capital derived by using the capital asset pricing model 
the primary components of this model include weighting our total asset structure between our equity and debt  the risk free rate of return on us treasury bonds  market risk premium based on a range of historical returns and forward looking estimates  and the beta of our common stock 
our model used an effective tax rate of approximately 
based on the methodology described above  the fair value of our det reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  therefore  we did not recognize an impairment charge related to goodwill in fiscal our market capitalization at the end of our third quarter of fiscal was approximately billion  which exceeded the aggregate carrying value of our reporting units by approximately 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology  patents  trademarks  customer relationships  and contracts  which are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the total future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes we make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this includes estimating actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
our policy is to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position is sustainable upon examination by tax authorities 
we include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
when accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued are reduced in the period that such determination is made and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax asset and liability balances  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and the reserve resulting from uncertainties in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or if the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
stock based compensation we determine the expense for all employee stock based compensation awards by estimating their fair value and recognizing that value as an expense  on a ratable basis  in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate over the expected term of the award 
we estimate the expected term of our stock based 
table of contents awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees 
we use a blend of the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility of our traded options as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
we reduce the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise our estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimate

the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our broadcast and other markets  and to a lesser extent  by increases in revenue from our ce market  partially offset by decreases from our pc market 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market was primarily driven by higher shipments in fiscal of digital televisions and set top boxes that incorporate our technologies 
the increase in revenue from our other markets was primarily driven by higher back royalties  in addition to increases in sales of devices incorporating our dolby mobile technology 
the increase in revenue from our ce market was primarily driven by increases in revenue from shipments of blu ray disc players  home theater in a box systems  digital media adaptors  and audio video receivers that incorporate our technologies  which were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from shipments of standard dvd players 
the decrease in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by decreased isv media applications in pc shipments 
the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our broadcast and pc markets  and to a lesser extent  by increases in revenue from our ce and other markets 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of digital televisions that incorporate our technologies sold in europe and apac in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by a greater number of computers sold containing windows operating systems that incorporate our technologies in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our ce market was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from blu ray disc players incorporating our technologies in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in revenue attributable to camcorders  and to a lesser extent  dvd players that incorporate our technologies 
in fiscal  we had an increase in revenue from reported shipments of camcorders incorporating our technologies that pertained to prior period sales 
the increase in revenue from our other markets was primarily due to an increase in he aac related revenue in the mobile market 
products 
the decrease in products revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to decreases in d and traditional cinema products revenue in fiscal  coupled with our adoption of new revenue recognition 
table of contents accounting standards in fiscal decreases in d products revenue in fiscal resulted from increased competition and promotional pricing  while decreases in traditional cinema products revenue were primarily due to lower shipments  as more exhibitors converted to digital cinema 
in addition  products revenue in fiscal included recognition of million of deferred revenue related to sales prior to the beginning of the year  which were accounted for under previous revenue accounting standards 
in fiscal substantially all products revenue resulting from current period sales were accounted for under the new accounting standards 
the increase in products revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in d and digital cinema products  coupled with our adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards in the beginning of fiscal we sold a greater number of d and digital cinema units in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  due to strong market demand driven by the success of certain d cinema releases  accompanied by promotions offering various bundled sets of digital cinema units  d units  and d glasses 
in addition  the new revenue recognition accounting standards allow us to recognize substantially all of the revenue associated with our digital cinema products sold in the period of sale 
for additional details  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by increases in revenue from support and maintenance for digital cinema equipment and from other theater services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly mastering services on digital films  and distribution activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which consisted primarily of municipal debt securities  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could impact our results of operations 
as of september   the weighted average effective maturity of our investment portfolio was less than one year 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   hypothetical changes in interest rates of and would have an impact on the carrying value of our portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing  and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom  australia  china  the netherlands  and germany 
we also conduct a growing portion of our business outside of the us through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi  and euro 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
most of our revenue from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currency 
therefore  if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  we will have increased operating expenses  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency  operating expenses will decrease  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure  in an effort to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest and other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
our foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the related receivables and payables for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
as of september   the outstanding balance sheet derivative instruments had maturities of days or less 
for additional information related to our foreign currency forward contracts  see note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency forward contracts as of september  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for these forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million
