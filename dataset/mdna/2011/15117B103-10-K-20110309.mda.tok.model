item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company currently focusing on the development of several immunotherapy technologies 
our lead programs include rindopepimut cdx  a vaccine that is expected to enter into phase development for glioblastoma multiforme in the second half of  and cdx  an antibody drug conjugate currently in a randomized phase b trial for treatment of advanced breast cancer 
we have additional programs at various stages of clinical and preclinical development  including cdx a therapeutic human antibody candidate for cancer indications  apc targeting technology programs  cdx and cdx  and an immune cell mobilizing agent cdx we are currently resourcing our priority programs and supplement the development of additional programs through external collaborations and funding 
our strategy is to develop and demonstrate proof of concept for our product candidates before leveraging their value through partnerships or  in appropriate situations  continuing late stage development through commercialization ourselves 
demonstrating proof of concept for a product candidate generally involves bringing it through phase clinical trials and one or more phase clinical trials so that we are able to demonstrate  based on human trials  good safety data for the product candidate and some data indicating its effectiveness 
we thus leverage the value of our technology portfolio through corporate  governmental and non governmental partnerships 
this approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product 
our current collaborations include the commercialization of an oral human rotavirus vaccine 
our product candidates address market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non existent 
our products are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to utilize the human immune system and enable the creation of preventative and therapeutic agents 
we are using these technologies to develop targeted immunotherapeutics comprised of antibodies  adjuvants and monotherapies and antibody drug conjugates that prevent or treat cancer and other diseases that modify undesirable activity by the body own proteins or cells 
a number of our immunotherapeutic and antibody drug conjugate product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trial programs 
the following table includes the programs that we currently believe are material to our business product generic indication field partner status clinical cdx rindopepimut glioblastoma multiforme phase b cdx glembatumumab vedotin metastatic breast cancer and melanoma phase b cdx muscle invasive bladder cancer phase cdx multiple solid tumors phase preclinical cdx cancer  autoimmune disease and transplant preclinical cdx immuno modulation  multiple tumors preclinical cdx renal and ovarian cancer preclinical marketed products rotarix rotavirus infection glaxosmithkline marketed 
table of contents the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of product candidates to each take five years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product candidate 
our estimates that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
we test potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and immunogenicity 
we may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of product candidates 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and our future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product candidate 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates increases 
regulatory approval is required before we can market our product candidates as therapeutic or vaccine products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data is safe and effective 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials through phase have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs  biologics and vaccines have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  contracts or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
during the past five years through december   we incurred an aggregate of million in research and development expenses 
the following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended december   and the amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs  license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program 
prior to  the privately held celldex research did not maintain records that allowed for quantification of research and development expenses by project 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands clinical rindopepimut cdx cdx cdx cdx preclinical cdx cdx cdx other other programs total r d expense clinical development programs rindopepimut cdx our lead clinical development program  rindopepimut  is a peptide based immunotherapy that targets the tumor specific molecule called egfrviii  a functional variant of the naturally expressed epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  a protein which has been well validated as a target for cancer therapy 
unlike egfr  egfrviii is not present in normal tissues  and has been shown to be a transforming oncogene that can directly contribute to the cancer cell growth 
egfrviii is commonly present in glioblastoma multiforme  or gbm  the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer  and has also been observed in various other cancers such as lung  liver  and head and neck cancer 
the food and drug administration fda has granted orphan drug designation for rindopepimut for the treatment of egfrviii expressing gbm as well as fast track designation 
in april  we and pfizer inc pfizer entered into a license and development agreement the pfizer agreement under which pfizer was granted an exclusive worldwide license to rindopepimut 
the pfizer agreement also gave pfizer exclusive rights to the use of egfrviii vaccines 
table of contents in other potential indications 
the pfizer agreement also provided for reimbursement by pfizer of all costs incurred by us in connection with the collaboration since the effective date 
on september   we received written notice the pfizer notice from pfizer of termination with respect to the pfizer agreement 
the pfizer notice was given under a provision of the pfizer agreement which permitted termination at any time and for any reason  upon days written notice to us 
the pfizer notice did not state a reason for termination 
in november  the pfizer agreement was terminated the pfizer termination and all rights to rindopepimut were returned to us 
effective with the pfizer termination  pfizer is no longer funding the development of rindopepimut 
the phase victori and phase a activate studies of egfrviii immunotherapy were led by collaborating investigators at the brain center at duke comprehensive cancer center in durham  north carolina and at md anderson cancer center in houston  texas and enrolled and evaluable patients  respectively 
an extension of the phase a study act ii at the same two institutions evaluated additional gbm patients treated in combination with maintenance temozolomide tmz the current standard of care 
we initiated a phase b randomized study act iii of rindopepimut combined with standard of care  tmz  versus standard of care alone in patients with gbm in over sites throughout the united states 
in december  we announced an amendment to convert the act iii study to a single arm phase clinical trial in which all patients were to receive rindopepimut in combination with temozolomide 
the decision  which followed the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee  was based on the observation that the majority of patients randomized to the control standard of care arm withdrew from this open label study after being randomized to the control arm 
patients participating in the control arm of the study were offered the option to receive treatment with rindopepimut 
under this amendment  the act iii study provided for a multi center  non randomized dataset for rindopepimut in patients with newly diagnosed gbm 
in november  we announced complete data for the primary endpoint of the patients enrolled to receive rindopepimut in combination with maintenance tmz in the act iii study 
the data showed that of patients were progression free at months after entry into the study 
taking into account the to months required to complete pre study chemoradiation and enter into the study  the month time point in act iii corresponds to approximately months after diagnosis 
the activate and act ii trials  which were conducted in two leading centers  reported progression free rates at months after diagnosis of and  respectively  and similar results were seen in the act iii trial  which enrolled patients in over centers in the united states 
the following table summarizes the progression free survival pfs and overall survival os rates from clinical trials of rindopepimut as reported in november as compared to matched historical controls and the standard of care

  importantly  rindopepimut showed a similar benefit in patients whether or not they expressed an active dna repair gene mgmt that has been shown to limit the benefit from tmz treatment 
in act iii  the number of patients who were expected to be resistant to the tmz chemotherapy appeared to do better with vaccination than the numbers observed in the historical data 
patients who have an active dna repair gene  mgmt unmethylated  generally have a worse outcome  presumably because they do not gain much benefit from tmz as reported in the literature 
patients with a methylated mgmt promoter in their tumor do not express mgmt and have a more favorable outcome to tmz treatment 
patients with methylated tumors n that were treated with the rindopepimut regimen experienced a median pfs of months  which compares favorably with the published data from the soc of radiation plus tmz r tmz of months 
those with unmethylated tumors n treated with the rindopepimut regimen experienced a pfs of months  which compared favorably to the pfs with soc of months in this patient population 
thus  rindopepimut would appear to benefit both methylated and unmethylated mgmt patients 
based on ongoing discussions to date with the fda  we are currently planning to initiate a pivotal phase randomized study of rindopepimut in patients with gbm in the second half of glembatumumab vedotin cdx cdx is an antibody drug conjugate adc that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody  cr  linked to a potent cell killing drug  monomethyl auristatin e mmae 
the cr antibody specifically targets glycoprotein nmb or gpnmb that is expressed in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer and melanoma 
the adc technology  comprised of mmae and a stable linker system for attaching it to cr  was licensed from seattle genetics  inc the adc is designed to be stable in the bloodstream 
following intravenous administration  cdx targets and binds to gpnmb and upon internalization into the targeted cell  cdx is designed to release mmae from cr to produce a cell killing effect 
treatment of breast cancer in june  an open label  multi center phase study was initiated of cdx administered intravenously once every three weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior therapy median of seven prior regimens 
the study began with a bridging phase to confirm the maximum tolerated dose mtd and then expanded into a phase open label  multi center study 
the study confirmed the safety of cdx at the pre defined maximum dose level mg kg in patients 
an additional patients were enrolled as an expanded phase cohort for a total of treated patients at mg kg  the phase dose to evaluate the pfs rate at weeks 
as previously seen in melanoma patients  the mg kg dose was well tolerated in this patient population with the most common adverse events of rash  alopecia  and fatigue 
the primary activity endpoint  which called for at least of patients in the phase study portion to be progression free at weeks  was met as of evaluable patients were progression free at weeks 
for all patients treated at the maximum dose level  tumor shrinkage was seen in and median pfs was weeks 
a subset of patients had triple negative disease  a more aggressive breast cancer subtype that carries a high risk of relapse and reduced survival as well as limited therapeutic options due to lack of over expression of her neu  estrogen and progesterone receptors 
in these patients  had any tumor shrinkage  week pfs rate was  and median pfs was weeks 
tumor samples from a subset of patients across all dose groups were analyzed 
table of contents for gpnmb expression 
the tumor samples from most patients showed evidence of stromal and or tumor cell expression of gpnmb 
the most common treatment related toxicities were fatigue  rash  nausea  alopecia hair loss  neutropenia and vomiting 
in may  the fda granted fast track designation to cdx for the treatment of advanced  refractory resistant gpnmb expressing breast cancer 
in september  we initiated a randomized phase b controlled study in patients with heavily pre treated  advanced breast cancer whose tumors are confirmed to express gpnmb via a validated  centralized diagnostic assay 
we expect that a significant portion of the enrolled patients will have triple negative disease  since gpnmb is frequently expressed in this patient population 
patients will be randomized to receive either cdx or single agent investigator choice chemotherapy 
activity endpoints will include objective response rate orr  pfs and os 
we expect to complete enrollment of patients at approximately clinical sites in the united states in with preliminary data expected in treatment of metastatic melanoma in june  a phase open label  multi center  dose escalation study was initiated to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cdx for patients with un resectable stage iii or stage iv melanoma who have failed no more than one prior line of cytotoxic therapy 
a total of patients were enrolled in this trial 
the trial initially evaluated doses of cdx between mg kg to mg kg given once every three weeks 
cdx was generally well tolerated  with rash and neutropenia emerging at higher doses 
the mtd was determined to be mg kg administered intravenously iv once every three weeks 
the study achieved its primary activity objective with an orr in the phase cohort of 
median pfs was months 
cdx was found to be active in advanced melanoma patients in the study 
the most frequent treatment related adverse events included rash  fatigue  alopecia hair loss  pruritus  diarrhea and neuropathy 
more frequent dosing schedules of cdx were also evaluated  including a weekly and a two out of every three week regimen  to explore if more frequent administration can provide additional activity in patients with metastatic melanoma 
doses of mg kg given once every week and mg kg given for two out of three weeks were identified as the mtd in each schedule 
the response rate was observed to be and  respectively 
this increased activity was accompanied by increased toxicity 
in the subset of patients with tumor biopsies  high levels of tumor expression of gpnmb appeared to correlate with favorable outcome 
in the seven patients whose tumors were found to express high amounts of gpnmb  and who were treated at the maximum tolerated doses across all dosing schedules  median pfs was months 
the development of rash  which may be associated with the presence of gpnmb in the skin also seemed to correlate with greater pfs 
melanoma is a difficult disease to work with and  at this point in time  our intention is to first focus our resources on advancing cdx in breast cancer 
we intend to conduct additional phase development of cdx in combination with other therapies in investigator sponsored studies to further develop this product candidate in melanoma 
cdx our lead apc targeting technology product candidate  cdx  is in development for the treatment of epithelial tumors such as colorectal  pancreatic  bladder  ovarian and breast cancers 
cdx targets the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin  known as hcg beta  which is an antigen often found in epithelial tumors 
the presence of hcg beta in these cancers correlates with a poor clinical outcome  suggesting that this molecule may contribute to tumor growth 
normal adult 
table of contents tissues have minimal expression of hcg beta  therefore  targeted immune responses are not expected to generate significant side effects 
the phase studies are complete 
the phase studies investigated the safety and immunogenicity of cdx alone and in combination with adjuvants  including gm csf known to increase mannose receptor expression on dendritic cells and toll like receptor tlr agonists poly iclc or hiltonol and r or resiquimod 
patients with an assortment of different tumor types that are known to express hcg beta were enrolled with retrospective analysis for hcg beta expression 
a regimen of every two week dosing for four doses was utilized with the possibility of retreatment if patients demonstrate tumor regression or stable disease 
the phase studies enrolled over patients with heavily pretreated  advanced stage colorectal  breast  pancreatic  bladder ureteral  ovarian and testicular cancer 
all patient cohorts demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no dose limiting toxicity 
the combination of cdx with tlr agonists significantly enhanced immune responses against hcg beta 
immune responses occurred even in the presence of high circulating levels of hcg beta  suggesting that the cdx can overcome antigen tolerance in advanced and heavily pretreated cancers 
nine patients in the studies experienced disease stabilization from months to months following the initiation of cdx vaccination 
these data provide the basis for advancing cdx into a front line patient population selected for hcg beta expressing cancers 
in may  we initiated a patient randomized phase controlled study to evaluate the cdx regimen in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in patients with newly diagnosed muscle invasive bladder cancers that express hcg beta 
cdx cdx  also developed from the apc targeting technology  is a fusion protein consisting of a fully human monoclonal antibody with specificity for the dendritic cell receptor  dec  linked to the ny eso tumor antigen 
in humans  ny eso has been detected in of all melanoma  lung  esophageal  liver  gastric  prostate  ovarian and bladder cancers  thus representing a broad opportunity 
this product is intended to selectively deliver the ny eso antigen to apcs for generating robust immune responses against cancer cells expressing ny eso unlike cdx  which targets the mannose receptor expressing dendritic cells  cdx is the first apc product targeting dec expressing dendritic cells 
we are developing cdx for the treatment of malignant melanoma and a variety of solid tumors which express the proprietary cancer antigen ny eso  which we licensed from the ludwig institute for cancer research in we believe that preclinical studies have shown that cdx is effective for activation of human t cell responses against ny eso in september  we initiated enrollment in a dose escalating phase clinical trial aimed at determining the optimal dose for further development based on the safety  tolerability  and immunogenicity of the cdx vaccine 
the trial will evaluate three different doses of the vaccine in combination with tlr agonists poly iclc or hiltonol and or r or resiquimod 
we expect to enroll approximately patients with solid tumor cancers at multiple clinical sites in the united states 
in october  we announced interim data for the first patients enrolled in the study  of whom had confirmed ny eso expression 
the interim data showed that six patients maintained stable disease and were eligible for multiple cycles of the treatment regimen  including patients who have received or more cycles weeks of treatment followed by a week rest  with stable disease of up to months 
the treatment was well tolerated and there were no dose limiting toxicities 
robust anti ny eso immunity was induced with the majority of the patients developing anti ny eso antibody responses and of the patients having increases in ny eso specific t 
table of contents cell responses  including both cd and cd responses 
importantly  the t cell responses were directed against multiple regions of the ny eso antigen 
preclinical and other development programs cdx cdx is a fms like tyrosine kinase ligand fltl that we licensed from amgen in march cdx is a growth factor for stem cells and immune cells called dendritic cells 
based on previous experience with this molecule  we believe that cdx has considerable opportunity in various transplant settings as a stem cell mobilizing agent 
in addition  cdx is an immune modulating molecule that increases the numbers and activity of specific types of immune cells 
we believe cdx has significant opportunity for synergistic development in combination with proprietary molecules in our portfolio 
in march  we filed an investigational new drug ind application for cdx we are in discussions with collaborators to initiate clinical development with a phase study in healthy volunteers 
cdx we have entered into a license agreement with the university of southampton  uk  to develop human antibodies to cd  a potentially important target for immunotherapy of various cancers 
in preclinical models  antibodies to cd alone have been shown to mediate anti tumor effects  and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapy 
cd is a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes 
it acts downstream from cd and may provide a novel way to regulate the immune responses 
in september  we exercised an option under our research and commercialization agreement with medarex  whereby we have a commercial license to the human antibody technology specifically for our cd antibody 
preclinical models with our human monoclonal antibody to cd have demonstrated immune cell activation and anti tumor responses 
we expect to file an ind application for a dose escalation phase study during the fourth quarter of after completing required preclinical toxicology studies 
cdx cdx is a fully human monoclonal adc that targets tim  an immunomudulatory protein that appears to down regulate immune response to tumors 
the antibody  cdx  is linked to a potent chemotherapeutic  monomethyl auristatin e mmae  using seattle genetics proprietary technology 
the adc is designed to be stable in the bloodstream  but to release mmae upon internalization into tim expressing tumor cells  resulting in a targeted cell killing effect 
cdx has shown potent activity in preclinical models of ovarian and renal cancer 
cdx cdx is a molecule that inhibits a part of the immune system called the complement system 
the complement system is a series of proteins that are important initiators of the body acute inflammatory response against disease  infection and injury 
excessive complement activation also plays a role in some persistent inflammatory conditions 
cdx is a soluble form of naturally occurring complement receptor that inhibits the activation of the complement cascade in animal models and in human clinical trials 
we believe that regulating the complement system could have therapeutic and prophylactic applications in several acute and chronic conditions  including organ transplantation  multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  age related macular degeneration amd  atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus  paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria pnh  dense deposit disease ddd in kidneys  and myasthenia gravis 
we are currently defining the most appropriate clinical 
table of contents development path for cdx and are focusing on rare disease conditions of unregulated complement activation as the fastest route to fda approval 
marketed products rotavirus vaccine rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children 
in  we licensed our oral rotavirus strain to glaxo and glaxo assumed responsibility for all subsequent clinical trials and all other development activities 
glaxo gained approval for its rotavirus vaccine  rotarix  in mexico in july  which represented the first in a series of worldwide approvals and commercial launches for the product leading up to the approval in europe in and in the us in we licensed in our rotavirus strain in and owe a license fee of to cincinnati children hospital medical center cch on net royalties received from glaxo 
we are obligated to maintain a license with cch with respect to the glaxo agreement 
the term of the glaxo agreement is through the expiration of the last of the relevant patents covered by the agreement  although glaxo may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
the last relevant patent is scheduled to expire in december no additional milestone payments are due from glaxo under the agreement 
in may  we entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of prf purchased a interest in the milestone payments and net royalties that we will receive on the development and worldwide sales of rotarix 
we have received a total of million in milestone payments under the prf agreement 
no additional milestone payments are due from prf under the agreement 
the prf agreement terminates on december   unless otherwise extended 
royalty rates on rotarix escalate from to based on net product sales in countries that have valid patent protection 
these royalty rates are discounted by for non patent countries primarily international markets 
in september  we received notice from glaxo that glaxo would begin paying royalties on sales of rotarix vaccine at the lower of the two royalty rates under their license agreement 
glaxo decision to pay the lower royalty rate which is of the full rate is based upon glaxo assertion that rotarix is not covered by the patents glaxo licensed from us in australia and certain european countries 
we are currently evaluating the basis for glaxo action and our potential remedies 
if glaxo position stands  the royalties to which prf is entitled will no longer be limited by a million annual threshold 
with respect to the million annual threshold  if worldwide net royalties on sales of rotarix exceed million in any year  we would retain approximately of all royalties in excess of million 
irrespective of glaxo position  we will still retain approximately of the royalties on worldwide sales of rotarix if prf receives times the aggregate cash payments of million it made to us  though the potential amount of such residual royalties will be lower if glaxo position stands 
in late march  the fda temporarily suspended the use of rotarix in the united states as a precautionary measure following the discovery of pcv dna material in the vaccine 
in may  the fda determined that healthcare practitioners could resume the use of rotarix 
our royalties from sales of rotarix were negatively impacted during the year ended december  by the fda decision to temporarily suspend the use of rotarix from march through may and that negative impact from the temporary suspension may extend into the future as well 
however  our net loss and cash position were not impacted even though our royalty revenue was impacted because there was an offsetting impact on our royalty expense 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include 
table of contents accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  research and development expenses and stock based compensation expense 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we account for business combinations that were completed after january   including the curagen merger  or will be completed in the future  under the acquisition method of accounting 
we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as ipr d  using a variety of methods including present value models 
each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of ipr d assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant assumptions regarding the probability of completing ipr d projects  which would require obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of the associated drug candidate  a market participant estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to complete ipr d projects  a market participant estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the transaction are expensed as incurred 
ipr d assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets are maintained on our consolidated balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired 
if a project is completed  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed 
if a project becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs 
ipr d assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination with a finite life are recorded at fair value and amortized over the greater of economic consumption or on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
the company performed an annual impairment test of the goodwill asset as of july  and concluded that the goodwill asset was not impaired 
for acquisitions completed prior to january   including the avant merger  we expensed the fair value of ipr d to research and development expense as of the acquisition date and included transaction costs associated with the business combination as part of the cost of the acquired company 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in january  we adopted a new us gaap accounting standard which amends existing revenue recognition accounting guidance to provide accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this new guidance eliminates the requirement to establish objective evidence of fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard  we had entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees were recognized as revenue when we had a contractual right to receive such payments  provided that i a contractual arrangement exists  ii the contract price is fixed or determinable  iii the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and iv we had no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
upfront non refundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we had continuing performance obligations under the terms of the agreement were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the estimated service period as we completed our obligations 
where our level of effort was relatively constant over the performance period or no other pattern was estimable  the revenue was recognized on a straight line basis 
revenue was limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments due or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if the estimated service period was subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee was recognized was modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
the determination of the performance period involved judgment on management part 
funding of research and development was recognized as revenue over the term of the applicable contract as costs are incurred related to that contract 
payments received to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
revenue from contracts and grants is recognized as the services are performed and recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the government or our contractual partner 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
product royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and are recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development costs  including internal and contract research costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs  manufacturing of clinical material  toxicology and other studies  personnel costs  depreciation  license fees and funding of outside research 
stock based compensation expense we record stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards expected to vest at the grant date and is adjusted  if necessary  to reflect actual forfeitures 
compensation expense for all stock based awards to employees and directors is recognized using the straight line method over the term of vesting or performance 
we record stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees based on the fair value of the stock options which is re measured over the vesting term resulting in periodic adjustments to stock based compensation expense 
results of operations our financial statements prior to the avant merger reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of celldex research

our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances

to date  the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities 
the timing of any new collaboration agreements  government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements  contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the next twelve  we will take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our long term liquidity needs including  but not limited to  the licensing of technology programs with existing or new collaborative partners  possible business combinations  issuance of debt  or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings 
while we may continue to seek capital through a number of means  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business  and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development
