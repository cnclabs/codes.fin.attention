back to contents global economic growth and increased demand for oil and natural gas are the primary drivers of customer expenditures to develop and produce oil and natural gas 
the recovery within the global economy began in and is anticipated to continue in increased economic activity  particularly in emerging asia and middle east economies  and market predictions for continued economic growth supports expectations of increasing demand for oil and natural gas 
spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which is dependent upon forecasts of the expected future supply and future demand for oil and natural gas products and associated estimates of costs to find  develop  and produce reserves  increased in as compared to changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending resulted in increased demand for the company s products and services 
in north america  customer expenditures increased for both oil and natural gas projects resulting in a increase in the north american rig count in as compared to the increase in oil directed drilling is a direct reflection of the global price of oil  which is currently trading at a premium  on a btu basis  relative to natural gas in north america 
the increase in gas directed drilling was driven by activity in unconventional shale gas plays due to the favorable prices of wet gas  despite relatively low prices for natural gas 
spending on gas directed projects in was supported by hedges on production made in prior periods when futures prices were higher  the need to drill and produce natural gas to hold leases acquired in earlier periods  the influx of equity from companies interested in developing a position in the shale resource plays and associated production of natural gas liquids in certain basins 
as a result of streamlining operational costs in and proactive management of operational costs during  the company was favorably positioned to respond to increased activity and product demand in further  innovative sales initiatives and strategic international efforts enabled the company to increase revenues by in as compared to forecasting the company s position in the current recovery cycle is challenging  as it differs from past cycles due to the overlay of continued worldwide uncertainties  including significant political unrest and radical regime and governmental changes in significant oil producing countries 
changes in product demand to liquid rich natural gas and oil products from natural gas products affected the type of industry drilling activity and increased petroleum pricing 
despite recent favorable activity the company expects continued uncertainty in drilling activity in due to a number of factors including commodity prices  global demand for oil and natural gas  supply and depletion rates of oil and natural gas reserves  as well as broader variables including government fiscal policies and current and potential political unrest in key petroleum producing countries 
the oil field services sector experienced a cyclical low in the third quarter of stabilization of the business and cost containment measures taken by the company beginning in were still being realized throughout the company expects improved economic conditions will continue throughout despite drilling activity uncertainty 
as exploration and production companies outlooks improve with higher expectations of forecast liquid rich natural gas and oil prices  the company remains optimistic capital budgets for drilling and completion activities will strengthen 
the company expects rig count in the oil basins  which have contributed to drilling revenue with increased teledrift business in the permian basin  to lead to margin relief on pricing 
the company expects that north american gas market activity will continue to remain stable in unconventional plays such as barnett  haynesville  marcellus and other basins which utilize the company s drilling tools 
in addition  the company expects chemical additives will continue realizes to enhanced performance  when added to fracturing fluids utilized in this type drilling further supporting the stability of product demand of the company s chemicals segment which is closely aligned to rig count activity 
the company plans to pursue identified international opportunities in the company expects drilling and completion activity to remain relatively stable compared to levels 
market conditions are forecast to improve slightly and pricing is expected to remain competitive throughout the company intends to continue the strategic initiative to add drilling jars and shock subs to the company s fleet and to reduce the company s sub rental usage 
the company also intends to continue to pursue international market opportunities with the teledrift line of mwd products during with research efforts focused on the chemicals segment  the company has been able to timely respond to the increased demand for growth in unconventional liquid rich and oil sand formation plays 
as a result of the company s success in unconventional areas  such as the marcellus shale  and within tight sand gas play areas  such as the niobrara  the company expects to continue to experience growth within identified basins by leveraging the proven success of the company s products  in particular  complex nanofluids 
the drilling segment has effectively redesigned the company s motors to operate more successfully in areas such as haynesville  barnett and bakken 
the increase in operational performance of the company s artificial lift segment enabled the company to significantly increase the customer base in capital expenditures in the drilling segment were million in compared to million in capital expenditures were significantly curtailed in in response to decreased demand 
management has forecast drilling capital expenditures of million in  however  this amount may fluctuate dependent upon market demand and realized results of operations 
the company intends to sharpen the focus of capital expenditures within the drilling segment to further increase the company s international presence 
the company s business is comprised of three reportable segments chemicals  drilling and artificial lift 
the company s focus is on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through the chemicals and drilling segments  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through the artificial lift and chemicals segments 
the company believes product offerings and geographical presence throughout all three business segments provides the company with diverse sources of cash flow 
although each segment has unique technical expertise  all segments share a commitment to provide customers with quality  competitively priced equipment and services 
the chemicals segment is comprised of two business divisions specialty chemicals and logistics
