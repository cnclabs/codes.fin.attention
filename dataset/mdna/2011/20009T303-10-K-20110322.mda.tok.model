item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere in this report 
general prior to  we were primarily focused on developing proprietary dna array based tools and instruments for the genetic research community  under the brand formerly known as customarray  as well as providing molecular diagnostics services through our wholly owned subsidiary  combimatrix diagnostics cmdx 
on april   we announced a strategic and operational restructuring plan the restructuring plan intended to significantly reduce operating costs  increase the focus on our diagnostic services business and transition senior management 
as part of the restructuring plan  we closed our customarray business and facilities located in mukilteo  washington and relocated our corporate headquarters to irvine  california 
since the restructuring  our strategic focus is on commercializing our diagnostics services business by increasing the volume of our existing tests  expanding the number of tests offered by our laboratory  increasing the number of customers and partners  and improving reimbursement for our testing 
we also initiated a search for a new president and chief executive officer  which was completed on august  with the hiring of r 
judd jessup 
concurrent with mr 
jessup appointment  mark mcgowan  our chairman of the board of directors  discontinued serving as interim president and ceo  a role which he had assumed as a result of dr 
amit kumar resignation from that role on june  dr 
kumar was our president and ceo from september to june  as a result of executing the restructuring plan  the financial results of our customarray business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted  amounts and disclosures throughout this report relate to our continuing operations 
we are a molecular diagnostics company that operates primarily in the field of genetic analysis and molecular diagnostics through our wholly owned subsidiary  combimatrix diagnostics cmdx  located in irvine  california 
cmdx operates as a diagnostics reference laboratory that provides dna based clinical diagnostic testing services to physicians  hospitals and other laboratories in two primary areas i prenatal and postnatal developmental disorders  and ii oncology 
cmdx provides its services through 
table of contents the use of array comparative genomic hybridization acgh  which enables the analysis of genetic anomalies 
our mission is to empower physicians to positively impact patient care through the delivery of innovative dna based clinical services 
we also own a one third minority interest in leuchemix  inc leuchemix  a private drug development company focused on developing a series of compounds to address a number of oncology related diseases 
prior relationship with acacia research corporation we were originally incorporated in october as a california corporation and later reincorporated as a delaware corporation in september in december  we merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of acacia research corporation acacia 
in december  we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec in order to register our common stock under the securities act of as part of a plan to split off from acacia the split off 
on august  the split off date  the split off was effected and our common stock became publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market symbol cbmx 
as of the split off date  we ceased to be a subsidiary of  or affiliated with  acacia 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and anticipated operating cash savings from our restructuring plan will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurances that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
overview of recent business activities during  our business activities were driven primarily by our restructuring plan  which was initiated during the second quarter and was substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of during this time we closed our customarray business  relocated our corporate headquarters to irvine  california  and hired r 
judd jessup as our president and chief executive officer 
we also strengthened our senior management team by hiring daniel forche as senior vice president of sales and marketing during the fourth quarter of we also added mark mcgowan to our board of directors  who became chairman of the board during the second quarter 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially 
table of contents from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  fair value measurements  accounting for derivatives embedded in certain debt securities  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been performed  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectability of amounts is reasonably assured 
service revenues from providing diagnostic tests are recognized when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician or clinic 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including commercial insurance companies  healthcare institutions  individuals and government payors including medicare and medicaid 
we report revenues from contracted payors based on a contractual rate  or in the case of medicare and medicaid  published fee schedules for our tests 
we report revenues from non contracted payors based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net recognized revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from non contracted third party payors  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
revenues from the sale of acgh slides  including shipping and handling fees but excluding statutory taxes collected from customers  as applicable  are recognized when delivery occurs 
there is no written or implied right to return or exchange the products 
revenues from multiple element arrangements are based on the relative selling price method  whereby we allocate consideration received to all deliverables of an arrangement at the inception of the arrangement based on the relative selling prices of each element 
in order to determine the selling price of a deliverable  we apply the following hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  and our best estimate of selling price for the deliverable if 
table of contents neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
several factors are considered when determining the estimated selling price of a deliverable  including  but not limited to  the cost to produce the deliverable  the expected margin on that deliverable  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies and the value added components of differentiated deliverables  if determinable 
in order for a deliverable to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  both of the following criteria must be met the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and when a general right of return exists  the delivery or performance of an undelivered item is considered probable and under our control 
our revenue arrangements do not have a general right of return 
when a deliverable does not meet the criteria to be considered a separate unit of accounting  we group that deliverable with other deliverables that  when combined  meet the criteria  and the appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined 
accounting for stock based compensation the compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense  on a straight line basis  over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award which is generally three years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures in compensation expense recognized 
fair value measurements we measure fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
we utilize a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable market inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level observable market inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions derivatives embedded in certain debt securities we evaluate financial instruments for freestanding or embedded derivatives 
derivative instruments that have been separated from the host contract and do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with changes in value recognized in as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change 
accounting for income taxes we recognize income taxes on an accrual basis based on tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
a tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not ie  likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being 
table of contents realized upon settlement 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if all  or some portion  of such assets will more than likely not be realized 
should they occur  our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense 
since our inception  no such interest or penalties have been incurred  however 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
due to the restructuring plan  management determined that our patent intangible assets were impaired 
this matter is discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management 
under the impairment test  if a reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
during the second quarter of  the company fair value as determined by the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market at the time fell below our carrying value  triggering an impairment analysis 
this matter is discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of the results of operations revenues and cost of revenues dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change services cost of services products cost of products services revenues 
services revenues are generated from providing dna based genomic testing services in the areas of pre and postnatal development disorders in children as well as oncology 
services revenues increased primarily due to volume increases of our diagnostic tests in both categories as well as increases in average revenue recognized per test 
billable test volumes were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases were driven primarily by increased sales and market penetration over previous periods 
average revenue per test was approximately  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due primarily to improved reimbursement from non contracted third party payors  resulting in higher average recognized revenues per test during compared with 
table of contents products revenues 
product revenues are generated exclusively from selling bacterial artificial chromosome  or bac  arrays and related reagents to a single distributor located in taiwan 
for the year ended december  compared to  product revenues increased due primarily to increased volumes of our bac arrays delivered to the taiwanese distributor 
we have recently been notified from our distributor that its customers are considering other bac array providers and as a result  it is likely that our revenues from product sales may decrease in future periods 
cost of products and services revenues 
cost of products and services include direct materials such as array and laboratory costs  direct laboratory labor wages and benefits  allocation of overhead and stock compensation expenses 
cost of services included  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of non cash stock compensation expense 
these costs increased for the periods presented commensurate with the increases in revenues from to operating expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change research and development expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses patent amortization and royalties equity in loss of investee goodwill impairment research and development expenses 
these expenses include labor and laboratory supply costs associated with investigating new tests  but primarily consist of development costs to maintain and improve our existing suite of diagnostic tests offered 
prior to launching a new test or modifying an existing test  appropriate clinical trials and extensive laboratory validations  consistent with the various regulatory bodies that govern our industry  must be performed 
these costs are classified as research and development for all periods presented 
the decrease during was due primarily to greater allocation of laboratory resources on production and commercial efforts compared to the prior comparable periods  where there was a greater emphasis on developing new tests 
in addition  research and development expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in stock compensation charges were due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested during the current year 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses include costs associated with marketing our tests to healthcare providers  compensation and benefit costs of our sales force and general and administrative staff  information technology  executive management  financial accounting and human resources  as well as facilities related costs  insurance  legal  audit and other professional services 
the increase was due primarily to increased sales and marketing activities as well as higher headcount during the marketing  general and administrative expenses also included a one time   write down of a cost basis investment that in management view had incurred another than temporary decline in the underlying market value of the investment  as well as one time ceo recruiting costs 
in addition  marketing  general and administrative expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash stock compensation expenses reflect prior stock option awards becoming fully vested during  partially offset by additional expense recognized from the issuance of new stock option grants made during 
table of contents equity in loss of investee 
this expense represents our recognition under the equity method of accounting of our minority interest in the operations of leuchemix  in which we own a one third minority interest 
during  our equity investment in leuchemix reached and as a result  we ceased recognizing additional expense from their underlying operations 
this has caused a decrease in this expense for the year ended december  compared to goodwill impairment 
the decline in our market capitalization during the second quarter of as indicated by the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market was considered by management to be a potential goodwill impairment triggering event 
as a result  we performed a business valuation using a market based approach and determined that all of our million in goodwill was impaired 
other non operating items dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change qualified therapeutic discovery program income litigation settlement gain loss from early extinguishment of debt interest income interest expense derivatives gains charges qualified therapeutic discovery program income 
we were awarded  in under the internal revenue service section d for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
earlier in  we submitted two grant proposals under this program and were notified that our applications were accepted and the related funds were paid  during the fourth quarter of we have not applied for  and do not expect to receive  any additional funding under this program 
also  since this program is non recurring in nature  we elected to classify the payments as other income for the period presented 
litigation settlement gain 
in february  we received gross proceeds of million from entering into a settlement agreement with national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa 
contingent attorneys costs and expenses relating to the settlement were million 
thus  the net amount of the settlement gain recognized was million during the year ended december  there were no such events in loss from early extinguishment of debt 
in march  we fully retired our secured convertible debenture the debenture 
as a result  the remaining  unamortized debt discount of  was written off as a non operating loss from early extinguishment of debt in the year ended december  there were no such events in interest expense 
since july  interest expense was primarily comprised of interest charges associated with the debenture  which accrued interest at an annual rate of on the outstanding principal balance 
interest expense also included amortization of the million of debt discount originally recognized from issuance of the debenture and related warrants using the effective interest method 
interest expense decreased as a result of retiring the debenture in march remaining interest charges are from certain capital leases for laboratory equipment 
derivative gains charges 
these gains charges represent the net gain or expense recognized from mark to model adjustments to the embedded derivatives associated with the debenture that were outstanding during the periods presented 
in accordance with us gaap  the conversion feature  cash 
table of contents redemption option  potential acceleration of maturity of the debenture and potential adjustments to the conversion price all represented embedded derivatives of the debenture that were recorded separately at fair value as other liabilities  with the corresponding fair value adjustments reflected as non operating charges or gains  depending upon the results of mark to model valuation adjustments 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using the convertible bond model  discounted cash flows and binomial lattice models 
in march  the debenture was retired 
as a result  the remaining derivatives liability of  was written off as a non operating gain in inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the net increase in are described below 
cash is held primarily in general checking accounts as well as in money market mutual funds backed by us government securities 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the change in working capital was due primarily to the impact of net cash flow activities as discussed below 
the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  change net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the overall net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the net litigation settlement proceeds from national union of million received in february investing activities 
the decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was due primarily to our ongoing short term cash management activities and changes in short term investments in connection with certain financing activities discussed below 
fixed asset purchases were  and  in and  respectively 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash flows from financing activities was due primarily to the repayment of the debenture totaling million during compared to repayment of a line of credit totaling  in also  net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants as well as the exercise of common stock options were zero during compared to million in restructuring plan 
on april   we announced a restructuring plan intended to focus our company on our diagnostic services business while shutting down our customarray business 
total restructuring charges incurred through december  were million before sale of surplus property  equipment and inventory  of which  were non cash write downs  million were paid out in cash as of december  and  were accrued as short term payables and are expected to be paid out in subsequent periods 
net of proceeds received from the sales of surplus property  equipment and inventory  we recognized a loss from restructuring for the year ended december  of 
table of contents million  which is included as a component of loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
future liquidity 
we have a history of incurring net losses and net operating cash flow deficits 
we are also deploying new technologies and continue to develop commercial products and services 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and anticipated operating cash savings from our restructuring plan will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurances that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
for example  reduction in operating costs could jeopardize our ability to launch  market and sell new diagnostics products and services necessary to grow and sustain our operations 
the anticipation that we will be required to obtain additional financing in the foreseeable future raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond the fourth quarter of in addition to seeking additional capital from outside sources  our plans in regard to these matters include restructuring our business  which we executed in  as well as reducing other costs that are not considered strategically vital to our business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
capital requirements 
we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending any patents claims  should they arise  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
however  we have entered into an operating lease for our laboratory space and corporate offices  totaling approximately  square feet 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
we have executed three capital leases totaling  for certain laboratory equipment
