item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except per share data overview we are a global designer and manufacturer of custom engineered ejectors  vacuum systems  condensers  liquid ring pump packages and heat exchangers to the refining and petrochemical industries  and a supplier of components and raw materials to the nuclear power generating market 
our equipment is used in critical applications in the petrochemical  oil refining and electric power generation industries  including nuclear  cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in alternative energy applications  including ethanol  biodiesel and coal and gas to liquids and other applications  and other diverse applications  such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  soap manufacturing  food processing  pharmaceuticals  and heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
our corporate offices are located in batavia  new york and we have production facilities in both batavia  new york and at our wholly owned subsidiary  energy steel  located in lapeer  michigan 
we also have a wholly owned foreign subsidiary located in suzhou  china  which supports sales orders from china and provides engineering support and supervision of subcontracted fabrication 
in advancement of our strategy to diversify our products and broaden our offerings to the energy industry  on december   we acquired energy steel 
this transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting

fiscal and near term market conditions the downturn in the global economy which commenced in fiscal led to reduced demand for petroleum based products  which in turn led our customers to defer investment in major capital projects 
we have seen an improved business environment over the past few quarters and believe that we are in the early stages of a business recovery 
while there continues to be risks around a global economic recovery  we believe current signs are more positive than a year ago 
in addition  we believe that the significant increase in construction costs  including raw material costs  which had occurred over the four to five year period prior to the recent downturn  also led to delays in new commitments by our customers 
the increase in costs resulted in the economics of projects becoming less feasible 
while some material costs have improved  copper and steel are again elevated and remain volatile 
near term demand trends that we believe are affecting our customers investments include as the world recovers slowly from the global recession  many emerging economies continue to have relatively strong economic growth 
this expansion is driving growing energy requirements and the need for more refined petroleum products 
although uncertainty in the capital markets continues  there has been some improved access to capital  which has resulted in certain previously stalled projects being released 
the expansion of the middle eastern economies and the continued growth in demand for oil and refined products has renewed investment activity in that area 
the planned sequential project activity for refineries is encouraging 
asia  specifically china  began experiencing renewed demand for refined petroleum products such as gasoline 
this renewed demand is driving increased investment in petrochemical and refining projects 

table of contents south america  specifically brazil  venezuela and colombia  is seeing increased refining and petrochemical investments that are driven by their expanding economies and increased local demand for gasoline and other products that are made from oil as the feedstock 
the us refining market has exhibited recent improvement  including near term increases in orders of short cycle and spare parts 
historically  these types of orders have suggested a recovery  as delayed spending is released 
we expect the us refining market will not return to the levels experienced during the last upcycle  but will improve compared with its levels over the past few years 
we expect that the us refining markets will continue to be an important aspect of our business 
investments in north american oil sands projects have recently increased  especially for extraction projects in alberta and foreign investment in alberta which suggest that downstream investments that involve our equipment might increase in the next one to three years 
investment in new nuclear power capacity may become subject to increased uncertainty due to political and social pressures  enhanced by the tragic earthquake and tsunami which occurred in japan in march however  the need for additional safety and back up redundancies at existing plants could increase demand in the near term 
we expect that the consequences of these near term trends will be more pressure on our pricing and gross margins  as the us refining market has historically provided higher margins than certain international markets 
because of continued global economic uncertainty and the risk associated with growth in emerging economies  we also expect that we will have continued volatility in our order pattern 
we continue to expect our new order levels to remain volatile  resulting in both strong and weak quarters 
for example  sequentially the past eight quarters had new order levels of        and  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
for the next several quarters  we also expect to see smaller value projects than what we had seen during the last expansion cycle 
this will require more orders for us to achieve a similar revenue level 
we believe that looking at our order level in any one quarter does not provide an accurate indication of our future expectations or performance 
rather  we believe that looking at our orders and backlog over a rolling four quarter time period provides a better measure of our business 
mix shift stronger international growth in refining and chemical processing with domestic growth in nuclear power and navy projects we expect growth in the refining and chemical processing markets to be driven by emerging markets 
we have also expanded our addressable markets through the acquisition of energy steel and our focus on us navy nuclear propulsion projects 
we believe our revenue opportunities will be equivalent between the domestic and international markets 
over the long term  we expect our customers markets to regain their strength and  while remaining cyclical  continue to grow 
we believe the long term trends remain strong and that the drivers of future growth include demand trends global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next two decades  primarily in emerging markets 
this is expected to offset estimated flat to slightly declining demand in north america and europe 
global oil refining capacity is projected to increase  and is expected to be addressed through new facilities  refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
increased demand is expected for power  refinery and petrochemical products  stimulated by an expanding middle class in asia 
increased development of geothermal electrical power plants in certain regions is expected to meet projected growth in demand for electrical power 

table of contents increased global regulations over the refining and petrochemical industries are expected to continue to drive requirements for capital investments 
increased demand is expected from the nuclear power generation industry 
increased focus on safety and redundancy is anticipated in existing nuclear power facilities 
long term increased project development of international nuclear facilities is expected  despite the recent tragedy in japan 
construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east is anticipated  where natural gas is plentiful and less expensive  is expected to continue 
increased investments in new power projects are expected in asia and south america to meet projected consumer demand increases 
long term growth potential is believed to exist in alternative energy markets  such as coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  ethanol and waste to energy 
shale gas development and the resulting availability of affordable natural gas as feedstock to us based chemical petrochemical facilities is expected to lead to renewed investment is chemical petrochemical markets in the us we believe that all of the above factors offer us long term growth opportunity to meet our customers expected capital project needs 
in addition  we believe we can continue to grow our less cyclical smaller product lines and aftermarket businesses 
emerging markets require petroleum based products 
these markets are expected to continue to grow at rates faster than the us therefore  we expect international opportunities will be more plentiful relative to domestic projects for these markets 
we believe the domestic and international markets will offer similar opportunities for us in the near term 
our domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate product sales  which had increased from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal  decreased to in each of fiscal and fiscal our order rates for fiscal were domestic and international  compared with fiscal  which were domestic and international 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share total assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with sales of  for fiscal the increase was driven by our acquisition of energy steel and the improvement in our base markets for petroleum based products 
energy steel contributed  or of the growth in fiscal domestic sales increased by  in fiscal  driven by our acquisition of energy steel 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  the same as fiscal international sales increased by  in fiscal  with increases in the middle east and south america up  and  respectively  partly offset by slower sales in asia  down  by market  sales for fiscal were to the refining industry down from in fiscal  to

our gross margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross margins in fiscal were impacted by certain project wins  which occurred in late fiscal and early fiscal  during a period when pricing was extremely competitive due to a small number of available opportunities 
in addition  fiscal margins  especially in the first half of the year  benefitted from projects won late in the last upcycle 
gross profit for fiscal decreased  compared with fiscal gross profit decreased due to a lower gross margin  which was mostly offset by higher volume 
gross profit in fiscal was adversely impacted by inventory step up and intangible asset amortization related to the energy steel acquisition 
these charges were in fiscal selling  general and administrative  or sg a  and other expenses for fiscal were  up compared with  in fiscal the increase in sg a was related to our acquisition of energy steel  which had of sg a including of intangible asset amortization costs related to post acquisition operating costs 
there were also of transaction costs related to the acquisition 
sg a  excluding energy steel  decreased  driven by lower pension and variable compensation costs 
sg a and other expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal to of sales compared with of sales in fiscal interest income for fiscal was  up from in fiscal this increase was due to higher average levels of cash during fiscal compared with fiscal interest expense was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the increase was due to an interest charge for unrecognized tax benefits

income per diluted share was and for the respective periods 
excluding the transaction costs related to the energy steel acquisition  net income and income per diluted share was  and in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a decrease  as compared with sales of  for fiscal the decrease was due to reduced demand for petroleum based products as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in fiscal  which caused our customers to defer investment in major capital projects 
this decline in sales occurred in all product lines 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  which were up from in fiscal domestic sales decreased by  in fiscal international sales declined  in fiscal  driven by sales declines in canada  south america  the middle east and europe  somewhat offset by higher sales in asia and africa 
sales for fiscal were to the refining industry down from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries up from and to other industrial applications down from  including electrical power 
our gross margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit for fiscal decreased  or  compared with fiscal gross profit decreased due to lower volume  which resulted in the significant under utilization of our production capacity 
the lower volume and utilization declines were partly offset by improved raw material purchasing benefits  especially in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and continued improvements in productivity 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  and other expenses for fiscal were  down compared with  in fiscal included in fiscal costs was a pre tax charge of for restructuring 
table of contents costs 
sg a and other expenses as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal to of sales compared with of sales in fiscal sg a expenses decreased due to lower variable costs eg  sales commissions  compensation  headcount expenses related to lower sales and cost controls in place throughout fiscal interest income for fiscal was  down from in fiscal this decrease was due to lower rates of return on our investments  which are primarily short term us treasury securities 
interest expense was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the increase was due to an interest charge of for unrecognized tax benefits  as discussed below  taken in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the increase was due to a charge for unrecognized tax benefits of related to research and development tax credits taken in tax years through such charge is management s estimate of our potential exposure related to an ongoing internal revenue service examination of our research and development tax credits 
we believe our tax position is correct and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our position 
associated with the tax charge was an interest charge of  as noted in the above paragraph  and a tax credit  related to such interest charge 
the combination of these charges and credit was a net charge to earnings of in taxes and in interest  which lowered our earnings per share in fiscal by per share

stockholders equity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity that can be found in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the following table shows the balance of stockholders equity on the dates indicated march  march  march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income earned in fiscal we repurchased shares in fiscal a total of shares have been repurchased  pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
at march  and may   the number of shares remaining that have been approved for repurchase under the stock repurchase program is on march   our net book value was up over march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income and an increase in the value of pension assets 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  to  due to a dividend increase which occurred in early fiscal we repurchased shares in fiscal  pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets appearing in item of part ii of this annual report on form k march  cash and investments working capital working capital ratio working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities 
working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
we use the ratios described above to measure our liquidity and overall financial strength 
as of march   our contractual and commercial obligations for the next five fiscal years ending march and thereafter were as follows payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases pension and postretirement benefits accrued compensation accrued pension liability liability for unrecognized tax benefits other liabilities total for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal to our postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february   we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged 
we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
no contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plan for fiscal net cash used by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with net cash provided of  for fiscal the largest changes  compared with fiscal  were an increase in unbilled revenue of  compared with a decrease of  in fiscal and a decrease in customer deposits of  compared with an increase of  in fiscal 
the increase in unbilled revenue was driven by timing of billings for a small number of projects  while the customer deposits decrease was the reversal of a large portion of the fiscal increase  which  in fiscal  resulted from major customers providing upfront negotiated cash payments to assist in lowering the cost for us to complete their projects 
we expect the unbilled revenue to convert to accounts receivable and then to cash in the first and second quarters of fiscal the customer deposits will likely continue to decrease throughout fiscal  as the large payments received in fiscal are used as planned to procure raw materials to fulfill orders 
the main contributors to cash generation  which partly offset the cash uses noted above  were net income   and depreciation and amortization   net working capital accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable contributed  
table of contents capital spending in fiscal was  up from  in fiscal  driven by an equipment investment to support the northrop grumman order for the us navy 
we used to purchase shares of stock as part of our stock buyback program in fiscal  compared with in fiscal in addition  we paid in dividends in fiscal  up from in fiscal cash and investments were  on march  compared with  on march   down 
the largest components of cash usage were the purchase of energy steel for  the items noted above  an unbilled revenue increase of  and a decrease in customer deposits of  we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in either a money market account or in us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of up to days 
our money market account is used to securitize our outstanding letter of credits and allows us to pay a lower cost on those letters of credit 
capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and for all other items 
in excess of of our fiscal capital expenditures were related to the northrop grumman project for the us navy won in fiscal sixty five percent of our capital spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately  to  over of our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be for machinery and equipment  with the remaining amounts to be used for information technology and other items 
our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na provides us with a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
in addition  the agreement allows us to increase the line of credit  at our discretion  up to another  for total availability of  borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
there were no other amounts outstanding on our credit facility at march  and our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate  or 
availability under the line of credit was  at march  we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
orders and backlog orders during fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  representing a decrease for fiscal orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy included in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
domestic orders were  or  of our total orders and international orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal domestic orders decreased by  or  primarily due to a larger order in fiscal in excess of  from northrop grumman to provide surface condensers for the us navy 
this was partly offset by the  of orders received from energy steel in fiscal international orders decreased by  or  as strong orders for refining in the middle east did not repeat in fiscal middle east orders were down  or  compared with fiscal orders from other international regions were flat as weakness in china was offset by increases in the rest of asia  as well as canada 
backlog was  at march  compared with a record  at march   a decrease 
backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately to of orders currently in backlog are not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications including the northrop grumman order for the us navy and all energy steel orders 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 

table of contents in fiscal  one order for  which had been placed on hold by our customer in fiscal  was cancelled 
all other orders which were previously on hold by our customers have now been released  the last order on hold for  was released subsequent to the end of the year 
outlook we believe that we are in the early stages of a recovery in the refinery and petrochemical markets 
we also believe the improved strength of the alternative energy markets  including the nuclear market  will continue into fiscal we experienced significant organic order growth in the second half of fiscal  supplemented by our acquisition of energy steel 
we believe that  with our current backlog of  improved order levels in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and strong pipeline  our recovery will continue into fiscal we expect revenue to increase to  to to million  in fiscal approximately  to of our revenue is expected to come from energy steel 
in fiscal  energy steel contributed of our revenue  as we completed our acquisition late in the third quarter of fiscal for the fourth quarter of fiscal  energy steel contributed of our revenue 
our backlog on march  was  order levels in the second half of fiscal were  compared with  in the first half of fiscal included in the second half figures was  of orders from energy steel 
we expect fiscal order levels to continue to be variable across the year  though we are optimistic that orders will be more similar to the second half of fiscal than the first half of the year 
we continue to expect a stronger international market  with pockets of strength in the us  especially in alternative energy  including nuclear business 
normally  we convert to of our existing backlog to sales within a month period 
however  the northrop grumman for the us navy project currently in our backlog will convert to revenue over the next three fiscal years  with the majority of the revenue occurring in fiscal and fiscal therefore  our march  backlog will extend beyond our historical level 
we expect to convert approximately to of our march  backlog to sales in fiscal for fiscal  we expect sales to be less variable by quarter than in fiscal in fiscal  fourth quarter sales were nearly double the level of sales in the first quarter 
our expected growth range for fiscal assumes conversion of backlog as well as continued market improvement and investment by our customers 
the upper end of the range  and above  may be achieved by acceleration of projects by refining and petrochemical and alternative energy end users  our historical customer base 
in addition  increased focus on safety and redundancy projects at us nuclear facilities may drive near term opportunities at energy steel 
we do  however  anticipate more revenue concentration in fiscal than in prior years 
two orders  the us navy project and a middle east refinery project  are expected to account for approximately of fiscal revenue 
any unexpected delay in either of these projects could impact fiscal revenue and earnings 
we expect gross profit margin in fiscal to be in the to range 
this margin level represents an increase from fiscal  which included some lower margin projects won during the depths of the downturn in our markets 
while we still have a few lower margin projects in our backlog  the overall margin within our backlog has improved compared with the start of fiscal we expect that the current shift of business in the refining and petrochemical market toward international markets  where margins are generally lower than domestic project margins will have the effect of reducing our margins 
in addition  at the start of a recovery we have historically experienced margins that are somewhat muted compared to later on in a recovery 
gross profit margins are expected to improve with anticipated volume increases throughout fiscal and beyond 
due to changes in geographical markets and end use markets  we expect gross margins are unlikely to reach the range achieved in the prior up cycle 
we believe long term upcycle gross profit margin percentage in the mid to upper s is a more realistic expectation 
we also expect this recovery will continue to be more focused on emerging markets  which historically have lower margins and more competitive pricing than developed markets 
we believe achievement of the upper end of our margin projections  and potential upside above the range  can occur if we experience i increased volume that increases utilization of capacity  ii continued improvements in our manufacturing productivity  and or iii expanded margin opportunities at energy steel 

table of contents sg a spending is expected to increase during fiscal to between  and  this includes the full year impact of energy steel compared with months in fiscal 
in addition to energy steel  we continue to invest in personnel as we prepare for increased opportunities in fiscal and beyond 
our effective tax rate during fiscal is expected to be between and 
cash flow in fiscal is expected to be positive  driven by improved net income and despite the significant increase in revenue  the minimal need for additional working capital 
we also expect to see reductions in unbilled revenue  partly offset by the drawdown of customer deposits which have been high since the fourth quarter of fiscal contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   other than noted above  we were unaware of any other material litigation matters 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred as of a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately  when evident to management 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 
business combinations and intangible assets 
assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based upon detailed valuations that use various assumptions made by management 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 

table of contents pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
the company is currently under examination by the united states internal revenue service the irs for tax years and the irs has completed its examination for tax years through in june  the irs proposed an adjustment  plus interest  to disallow substantially all of the research and development tax credit claimed by the company in tax years through the company filed a protest to appeal the adjustment in july a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to this tax position was recorded at march  and critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  fair value estimates of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize a substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method 
table of contents for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows are discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the transaction and the time value of money 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  the high cost barrier to entry of markets  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to deprecation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal is for our defined benefit pension and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k related to revenue  contingencies  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in the normal course of business  management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 
based upon this review  management does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements  which have not already been adopted  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of march  or march   other than operating leases and letters of credit

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from market changes to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  price risk and project cancellation risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate  price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales  the same as for fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  all sales for which we or our subsidiaries were paid were denominated in the local currency us dollars or rmb 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our purchases in foreign currencies represented  and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or fiscal  and as of march  and  respectively  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 
price risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions 
although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence  among other things  such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices 
moreover  the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility 
such factors  in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products 
project cancellation and project continuation risk economic conditions over the past few years have led to a higher likelihood of project cancellation by our customers 
we had one project for  cancelled in the first quarter of fiscal we also had one project for cancelled in fiscal our last project on hold  in the amount of  was released in april currently  we have no projects on hold 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred 
as a result  we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled 
open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers 
if it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date  management will move the project into placed on hold ie  suspended category 
furthermore  if a project is cancelled by our customer  it is removed from our backlog
