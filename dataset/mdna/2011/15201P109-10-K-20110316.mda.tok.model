table of contents through our subsidiary banks  we conduct commercial and retail banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans  construction  development and land loans  and commercial loans and consumer loans 
most of our loans are secured by real estate located in central florida 
our profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and also includes commissions earned on bond sales  brokering single family home loans  sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments 
non interest expense consists of compensation  employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses 
our two subsidiary banks operate through bank branch locations in fourteen counties in central florida  including the four branches acquired from td bank  na during january  as summarized in the table below subsidiary banks no 
of locations counties centerstate bank of florida csb citrus  hendry  hernando  indian river  lake  marion  okeechobee  osceola  orange  pasco  polk  sumter  putnam valrico state bank vsb hillsborough correspondent banking division we also operate a correspondent banking and bond sales division 
the division is integrated with and part of our lead subsidiary bank  csb  located in winter haven  florida  although the majority of our bond salesmen  traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in birmingham  alabama and atlanta  georgia 
the business lines of this division are primarily divided into three inter related revenue generating activities 
the first  and largest  revenue generator is commissions earned on fixed income security sales 
the second category includes a correspondent bank deposits ie  federal funds purchased and b correspondent bank checking accounts 
the third  and smallest revenue generating category  includes fees from safe keeping activities  bond accounting services for correspondents  and asset liability consulting related activities 
the customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in florida  alabama  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and west virginia 
fdic assisted acquisitions and other branching activities we closed three small branches during and transferred the deposit and loan accounts to other existing branches 
we did not open any new branches during however  we acquired four additional branches with million of deposits pursuant to a fdic assisted transaction on january  no loans were included in the assisted acquisition  but subsequently we selected and purchased approximately million of performing loans from the fdic at par without loss share protection 
during we acquired three failed financial institutions through fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions included approximately million of deposits and loans with a fair value as of the acquisition 
table of contents date of approximately million 
substantially all the loans have loss share agreements beginning with the first dollar of loss 
in total  these three acquisitions included nine branch locations  all within or contiguous with our current geographical market footprint 
also during  we hired a seasoned and experienced management team in the vero beach  florida area  and opened a new branch around this team 
similarly  we also hired another seasoned and experienced management team in the okeechobee  florida area  and opened a new branch around this team as well 
in january we closed on a previously announced transaction with td bank  na whereby we acquired four branches in putnam county  florida 
total deposits acquired approximated million of which we did not pay a premium 
in addition  we selected and purchased approximately million of performing loans located within our fourteen county market area in central florida 
we purchased the loans for of the legal unpaid balance and have an option during the initial two year period to put back any loan that becomes past due greater than thirty days or becomes classified pursuant to banking regulation guidelines 
capital offering during the third quarter of we raised additional capital through a public stock offering 
we sold a total of  common shares at per share 
after investment banking fees and other expenses  the net increase to our common equity was approximately million 
about a year later  during the third quarter of we again raised additional capital through another public stock offering 
we sold a total of  common shares at per share 
after investment banking fees and other expenses  the net increase to our common equity was approximately million 
these capital raises were both offensive and defensive in nature 
we used them to support our growth from the acquisitions discussed above  as well as a buffer against losses and potential losses in our loan portfolio resulting from the significant downturn in the florida real estate market 
we also used a portion of this capital to redeem the tarp preferred shares and warrants in critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
a standardized loan grading system is utilized at each of our subsidiary banks 
the grading system is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers of each bank assign a loan grade to their 
table of contents newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
we use a loan grading system of through grade is excellent and grade is doubtful 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to that particular bank s board of directors 
our loan review officer  who is independent of the lending function and is not an employee of any subsidiary bank  periodically reviews each bank s loan portfolio and lending relationships 
the officer may disagree with a particular bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
as such  our lending process is decentralized  but our credit review process is centralized 
beginning in late  our ceo initiated a new program referred to as centercourt  whereby all of our bank presidents and our chief lending officers are gathered together in one room along with our ceo  cfo  coo and chief loan review officer 
each bank president and chief lending officer present their prepared written report on the status of their bank s loan portfolio 
past due  non accrual  impaired  potentially impaired  and loans in process of foreclosure  as well as oreo issues are presented and discussed 
these meetings are generally held once per quarter 
the objectives include early and quick identification and resolutions of potential loan losses  as well as sharing information and ideas between banks 
the process also contributes to each bank s allowance for loan loss analysis assumptions and preparation 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of the company s loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the aggregate of these two components results in our total allowance for loan losses 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has selected november as the date to perform the annual impairment test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet 
other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions 
they are initially measure at the fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
goodwill and intangible assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax asset a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required when it is considered more likely than not greater than probability that all or part of the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
we expect to realize our deferred tax asset over the allowable carryforward periods 
therefore  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our deferred tax asset as of december  however  if an unanticipated event occurred that materially changed pre tax and taxable income in future periods  a valuation allowance may become necessary 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income our net loss for the year ended december  was  or loss per share basic and diluted  compared to net loss of  or loss per share basic and diluted for the year ended december  this was our second consecutive year we reported losses  and in both years the primary underlying reason was related to credit costs  which is a reflection of the continued deterioration of the real estate market in florida 
although our overall credit cost was higher in versus  our net loss was lower  due to a variety of other factors including higher commissions earned on correspondent banking bond sales  higher gain on sale of securities available for sale  a bargain purchase gain from one of our fdic assisted transactions  and earnings growth from the acquisitions during the year 
these and other factors contributing to our results are discussed below 
net interest income margin net interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets  less interest expense

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses expense increased  to  during the year ending december  compared to  for the comparable period in our policy is to maintain the 
table of contents allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach

the correspondent banking bond sales division had an outstanding year most of which can be attributed to a record third quarter 
we expect significant volatility in the fixed income business  and therefore do not consider their initial three year performance necessarily a trend 
we sold a significant amount of securities available for sale during the current year pursuant to our asset liability management process 
we manage our balance sheet with the objectives of lowering our overall cost of deposits and freeing up additional capital 
as we shrink higher cost time deposits  the release on the asset side of the balance sheet is security sales 
with a slightly smaller balance sheet  as well as improving margins  results in excess capital to deploy on additional acquisitions  which tend to produce substantially higher rates of returns than a small incremental net interest income margin 
we do not know if we will be successful with additional acquisitions  and if we do shrink the balance sheet with security sales  we do not know what future interest rates will be and therefore uncertain as what potential gains  if any  could be expected

table of contents we use a combination of performance incentive bonus guidelines to motivate our employees and influence behavior 
these are primarily tied to earnings performance and growth metrics at each business unit 
as our net income increases and our assets grow  our employee incentive bonus compensation also increases 
in addition  we also have incentive compensation programs tied to growth of core deposits for certain employee classes responsible for these types of deposit customer relationships 
although we reported a net loss for on a consolidated basis  two of our banks were profitable 
in addition  our performance guidelines reward balance sheet growth as well  up to certain levels 
as a result  several business units qualified for an incentive award 
approximately of the  employee incentive bonus compensation recognized during relates to our largest subsidiary bank  csb  excluding the employees from the other two national chartered banks that were merged into it during december the remaining was dispersed among most of the remaining business units and several of the senior corporate officers 
see our compensation discussion and analysis in our current year s proxy statement for a discussion of executive compensation 
during our occupancy expense increased by  or and our depreciation expense increased by  or compared to this increase was due to the nine additional offices we acquired and the two denovo branches discussed above 
marketing expenses increased by  or year to year 
most of this increase relates to the continued checking account marketing campaign as well as an effort to develop internet related marking programs 
in addition  we have grown in geographical markets as our branch network continues to grow 
data processing expenses increased by  or during compared to this increase was primarily due to conversion and merger related activities and adding additional offices 
the increase in the line item legal  accounting and other professional expenses was primarily due to consulting fees paid for services relating to managing foreclosure and repossessed properties  outsourcing fees related to certain internal audit functions  and increases in legal fees associated with various new and potentially new business lines and various regulatory issues 
loss from the sale of repossessed real estate  loss from the write down in valuation of repossessed real estate and losses from other repossessed assets as well as foreclosure related expenses as a group was  during compared to  during  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase is reflective of the continuing deterioration in the real estate market in central florida and the economy in general 
income tax benefit provision we recognized an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of  an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax benefit of  an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the reason our effective tax rates are higher than our statutory tax rate is because we had substantial tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby increasing our taxable loss substantially above our book loss as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations

we also acquired four ocala national bank offices from the fdic in january in addition to the 
table of contents added cost from growth  we also incurred substantially more credit related expenses this year compared to last year  due to the deterioration in real estate market 
we also incurred an impairment charge relating to a core deposit intangible 
significant line items listed above are discussed in more detail below 
our largest non interest expense is employee and employee related expenses 
total salaries  wages and employee benefits for accounted for of our total non interest expense  and for referring to the table above  employee salaries and wages increased by  or to  for  compared to  for the increase was primarily due to the correspondent banking division started in november the majority of employee salaries and wage expense from the correspondent banking division is related to commissions on bond sales  which is all variable based

the atlanta office did not open until july excluding the correspondent banking division  discussed above  total salaries and wage expense was  for compared to  for this increase was due to the increase in full time equivalent employees ftes  excluding correspondent banking division 
we closed three small branches during  but acquired four larger branch offices in january  which is the primary reason for the increase in ftes  along with our internal growth

year year employee salary and wages remove correspondent banking division salary and wages employee salary and wages  excluding correspondent banking division total average ftes remove correspondent banking division average ftes average ftes excluding correspondent banking division cost per average fte  excluding correspondent banking division we use a combination of performance incentive bonus guidelines to motivate our employees to perform 
these are primarily tied to earnings performance and growth metrics at each business unit 
as our net income increases and our assets grow  our employee incentive bonus compensation also increases 
in addition  we also have incentive compensation programs tied to growth of core deposits for certain employee classes responsible for these types of deposit customer relationships 
although we reported a net loss for on a consolidated basis  two of our banks were profitable 
in addition  our performance guidelines reward balance sheet growth as well  up to certain levels 
as a result  several business units qualified for an incentive award 
approximately of the  employee incentive bonus compensation recognized during relates to our largest subsidiary bank  which is also our most profitable 
the remaining was dispersed among most of the remaining business units and several of the senior corporate officers 
during our occupancy expense increased by  and our depreciation expense increased by  compared to this increase was due to the correspondent banking division which opened an office in birmingham in november and in atlanta in july in addition we acquired four larger bank branch offices in ocala in january and closed three small ones in april marketing expenses increased by  or year to year 
most of this increase relates to the checking account marketing campaign which had previously been in place at one of our banks 
data processing expenses increased by  during compared to this increase was primarily due to adding  converting and integrating our new correspondent banking division offices both in 
table of contents birmingham and in atlanta 
these offices  with their bloomberg terminals and other specialized it equipment requirements are significantly more expensive than our average commercial bank branch office 
however  in addition to converting these offices  we also converted four offices in ocala which we purchased from the fdic in january  after operating dual systems for almost four months during the conversion process 
the increase in the line item legal  accounting and other professional expenses was primarily due to monthly consulting fees paid relating to the correspondent banking business initiated during the fourth quarter of  consulting fees paid for services relating to managing foreclosure and repossessed properties  outsourcing fees related to certain internal audit functions  and increases in legal fees associated with various lease negotiations  new and potentially new business lines and various regulatory issues 
we recognized a core deposit impairment charge related to deposits acquired in our acquisition of the former mid florida bank  now part of our csna bank 
the transaction account balances decayed faster than originally expected  and as such a write down in value was required 
we also recognized an impairment charge of  related to excess bank property held for sale 
this property was not acquired as a result of foreclosed loans  but was purchased by the bank for future expansion  and in one case relates to a single family home purchased by the company several years ago  at the then appraised value  as a result of moving one of our executive officers 
during the last quarter of  we obtained new appraisals and wrote the properties down to estimated market values based on these appraised values less estimated cost to sell 
bank regulatory expenses  including deposit insurance expense  increased by  or in compared to this increase was a result of increased deposit insurance premiums  which were a result of increased rates and growth in deposits  and a special assessment levied by the fdic of approximately  during the second quarter of in december  each of our banks were required to prepay a three year insurance premium  which in the aggregate is approximately  and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
loss from the sale of repossessed real estate  loss from the write down in valuation of repossessed real estate and losses from other repossessed assets as well as foreclosure related expenses as a group was  during compared to  during  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was reflective of the deterioration in the real estate market in central florida and the economy in general 
income tax benefit provision we recognized an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of  an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax provision expense of  an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the reason s effective tax rate was higher than our statutory tax rate is because we had substantial tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby increasing our taxable loss substantially above our book loss as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the primary reason for the difference in effective tax rates between the two years is that we went from a relative small pre tax income amount in to a much larger pre tax loss in the table below demonstrates this difference 
in thousands of dollars year year loss income before provision for income taxes net tax exempt income taxable loss income statutory income tax rates income tax benefit provision effective tax rates 
table of contents comparison of balance sheets at december  and december  overview our total assets grew by  or  from  at december  to  at december  the increase was the result of our three failed bank acquisitions from the fdic 
investment securities available for sale we account for our securities at fair value and classify them as available for sale  except for trading securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
if our management intends to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if our management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
our available for sale portfolio totaled  at december  and  at december   or and  respectively  of total assets 
see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 
we use our security portfolio primarily as a tool to manage our balance sheet  manage our regulatory capital ratios  as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  we remain short term in our decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
we have designated all of our securities as available for sale  except our trading portfolio  to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
we believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels 
the available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december   compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december  we invest primarily in direct obligations of the united states  obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the united states  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and obligations of government sponsored entities and agencies of the united states

the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage 
table of contents of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets

seventeen and a half percent of our total loans  or  are covered by fdic loss sharing agreements related to the acquisition of three failed financial institutions during the third quarter of pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic is obligated to reimburse us for of losses with respect to the covered loans beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred  subject to the terms of the agreements 
we will reimburse the fdic for its share of recoveries with respect to the covered loans 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provide for fdic loss sharing and our reimbursement to the fdic for recoveries for ten years 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to commercial loans provides for fdic loss sharing for five years and our reimbursement to the fdic for a total of eight years for recoveries 
eighty two and a half percent of our loans  or  are not covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 
of this amount approximately are collateralized by real estate  are commercial non real estate loans and the remaining are consumer and other non real estate loans 
the loans collateralized by real estate are further delineated as follows 
residential real estate loans these are single family home loans originated within our local market areas by employee loan officers 
we do not use loan brokers to originate loans for our own portfolio  nor do we acquire loans outside of our geographical markets 
the size of this portfolio is  representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  commercial real estate loans this is the largest category  of our loan portfolio representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
this category  along with commercial non real estate lending  is our primary business 
there is no significant concentration by type of property in this category but there is a geographical concentration such that the properties are all located in central florida 
the borrowers are a mix of professionals  doctors  lawyers  and other small business people 
approximately of these loans are owner occupied 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  construction  development and land loans we have no construction or development loans with national builders 
we do business with local builders and developers that have typically been long time customers 
this category represents approximately  of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of this amount is land development  lots  and other land loans 
approximately  of loans in this category are non performing non accrual loans loans as of december   of which substantially all are collateralized by residential building lots  commercial building lots  undeveloped land and vacant land both residential and commercial 
loan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities  which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed of total capital 
due to the lack of diversified industry and the relative proximity of markets served  we have concentrations in geographic regions as well as in types of loans funded

table of contents the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio 
see liquidity and market risk management for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans  as defined by asc impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan contract 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over the most recent two years 
this actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment 
the following portfolio segments have been identified residential real estate loans first mortgage residential real estate second mortgage residential real estate home equity lines of credit commercial real estate loans apartment loans commercial real estate other than multifamily apartment loans construction  development  land loans commercial loans not collateralized by real estate consumer and other loans not collateralized by real estate the historical loss factors for each portfolio segment is adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the environmental factors that we consider are listed below 
we consider changes in the levels of and trends in past due loans  non accrual loans and impaired loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans 
also  we consider changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
we consider levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries 
we consider changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans 
we consider changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses 
we also consider changes in the quality of our loan review system 
we consider changes in the experience  ability  and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 

table of contents we consider changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments national and local economic trends and conditions 
we consider the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio industry conditions 
we consider the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
in the table below we have shown the two components  as discussed above  of our allowance for loan losses at december  and the data in the table below excludes loans covered by fdic loss share agreements

we also observed continued degradation of real estate values nationally in general  and within florida specifically 
we believe the changes in these trends differ significantly enough from historical trends such that we have increased our general allowance risk factors 
as shown in the table above  our allowance for loan losses alll as a percentage of total loans outstanding was at december  and at december  our alll had a net increase of  during this twelve month period 
of this amount   relates to an increase in our component  or general allowance  which is due to changes in this component s risk factors  as discussed above 
our specific allowance  component  is the aggregate of the results of individual analyses prepared for each one of our impaired loans  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements  on a loan by loan basis 
this component decreased by  during the same period 
the primary reason the specific allowance decreased was due to partial charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
net charge offs during were  compared to  in approximately  of commercial loan charge offs during the year is related to the troubled loans which were disposed of in the wholesale debt market 
the company sold troubled commercial loans with an aggregate unpaid legal balance of approximately  for an amount equal to about of the unpaid legal balance 
the company had been receiving about to on average of the unpaid legal balance when a troubled loan is eventually foreclosed and the asset is repossessed and eventually sold 
we are committed to the early recognition of problems and to maintaining a sufficient allowance 
we believe our allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate

non performing loans consist of non accrual loans and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements 
non performing assets consist of non performing loans plus a oreo ie real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  b other repossessed assets that is not real estate  and c are not covered by fdic loss share agreements 
we place loans on non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when we place a loan on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status or interest is recognized only to extent received in cash

oreo is carried at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell 
further declines in real estate values can affect the market value of these assets 
any further decline in market value beyond its cost basis is recorded as a current expense in our statement of operations 
the current carrying value represents approximately of the unpaid legal balance of the related loan when the asset was repossessed

management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be repaid as agreed pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once the loan has been identified as impaired  a written analysis is performed to determine if there is a potential for a loss 
if it is probable that a loss may occur  a specific reserve  or a partial charge down  for that particular loan is then recognized 
the loan is then placed on non accrual status and included in non performing loans 
if the analysis indicates that a loss is not probable  then no specific reserve  or partial charge down  is recognized 
if the loan is still accruing  it is not included in non performing loans 
loans that are monitored for impairment pursuant to asc generally include commercial  commercial real estate  land  acquisition development of land  and construction loans greater than  smaller homogeneous loans  such as single family first and second mortgages  consumer loans  and small business and commercial related loans are not generally subject to impairment monitoring pursuant to asc  but are analyzed for potential losses based on historical loss factors  current environmental factors and to some extent loan grading

in this current real estate crisis that the nation in general and florida in particular has been experiencing  it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in certain circumstances it may be more beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market 
when we have modified the terms of a loan  we usually reduce the monthly

table of contents loans are modified to minimize loan losses when we believe the modification will improve the borrower s financial condition and ability to repay the loan 
generally we do not forgive principal  however  we forgave  of principal on one of our tdr loans in we generally either reduce interest rates or decrease monthly payments for a temporary period of time and those reductions of cash flows are capitalized into the loan balance

liquidity and market risk management market and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
we measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset liability management effort 
each of our banks generally attempts to maintain a range set by policy between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
the range set by the banks has been approved by their board of directors 
if any of our banks fall outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval  by that particular bank s board of directors 
the asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 

table of contents our gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals

the table below presents the market risk associated with our financial instruments 
in the rate sensitivity analysis table  rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by repricing periods 
the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on our judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if we had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates

as stated earlier  the rate sensitivity table above summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods at a point in time 
it does not include assumptions about sensitivity to changes in various interest rates by asset or liability type  correlation between macro environment market rates and specific product types  lag periods  cash flows or other assumptions and projections 
however  in addition to static gap analysis  our banks also use simulation models to estimate the sensitivity of their net interest income to changes in interest rates 
simulation is a better technique than gap analysis because variables are changed for the various rate conditions 
each category s interest change is calculated as rates ramp up and down 
in addition  the repayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed 
rate shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next four quarters under several rate change levels 
these levels span in bps increments up and down from the current interest rates 
in order to simulate activity  maturing balances are replaced with the new balances at the new rate level  and repricing balances are adjusted to the new rate shock level 
the interest is recalculated for each level along with the new average yield 
net interest margin is then calculated and a margin risk profile is developed 
the results of these calculations  as of december  looking four quarters into the future  for our combined banks  are summarized in the table below 
change in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps resulting effect on net interest income a current a the percentage change in each of these boxes represents a percentage change from the net interest income dollars that the models projected for the next four quarters 
to put this in perspective  as an example  our net interest income for was  assuming a bps decrease in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would decrease by  or approximately  likewise  assuming a bps increase in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would increase by  or approximately  it is important to reiterate again  that these models are built on a multitude of assumptions and predictions 
this is not an exact science 
the benefit that we see is measuring our overall interest rate risk profile 
although we are by no means suggesting the exactness of the numbers above  what we see as a take away is that in general  it appears that if market interest rates increase  it would suggest a benefit to our net interest income 
if market interest rates decrease  it would suggest a negative effect on our net interest income 
we believe that our interest rate risk is manageable and under control as of december  simulation and rate shock stress testing our net interest income nim is a forward looking analysis 
that is  it estimates  based on various assumptions  what the effect on our nim might be given various changes in future interest rates 
another way of analyzing our interest rate risk profile is looking at history 
the table below measures the correlation between our nim and market interest rates over a ten year period starting at the beginning of and ending on december  we used the prime lending rate as a surrogate for market interest rates 
this simple correlation is not perfect because we ignore changes in duration of our asset liability portfolio over time and changes in the slope of the yield curve over time  as well as other significant environmental changes that may occur  such as the banking crisis of and however  it will demonstrate that over time our asset liability portfolio generally tended to be asset sensitive 
that is  in general  over this historical period  when market interest rates increased  our nim increased  and when market interest rates decreased  our nim decreased 
in the table below  the prime rate is measured by the vertical bars  and their scale is on the left hand side of the graph 
each bar represents a month 
our nim is represented by the line graph and its scale is on the right hand side of the graph 
the line graph is connecting a series of dots  which represents our nim for a given quarter 

table of contents net interest margin vs 
prime logo managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process 
our philosophy is to not try to guess the market in either direction 
we do not want to be excessively assets sensitive or excessively liability sensitive 
we try to manage our asset liability portfolio with the goal of optimizing our yield without taking on excessive interest rate risk 
contractual obligations while our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity  the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on our future obligations

the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
each of our subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on our company 
selected consolidated capital ratios at december   and were as follows capital ratios dollars are in thousands actual well capitalized excess amount ratio amount ratio amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets 
table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce our earnings from such activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than approved and unfunded loans and letters and lines of credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk for their specific bank 
substantially all of our interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of each of our subsidiary banks 
as such  the board of directors of each subsidiary bank is responsible to review and approve the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
