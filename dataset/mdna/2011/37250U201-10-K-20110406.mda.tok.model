table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview geomet  inc is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the exploration for and development and production of natural gas from coal seams coalbed methane or cbm and non conventional shallow gas 
we were originally founded as a consulting company to the coalbed methane industry in and have been active as an operator and developer of coalbed methane properties since our principal operations and producing properties are located in the cahaba basin in alabama and the central appalachian basin in west virginia and virginia 
we also own additional coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights  principally in alabama  british columbia  virginia  and west virginia 
as of december   we own a total of approximately  net acres of coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights 
our ability to successfully leverage our competitive strengths and execute our strategy depends upon many factors and is subject to a variety of risks 
for example  our ability to drill on our properties and fund our capital budgets may depend  to a large extent  upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations at or above current levels  maintain borrowing capacity at or near current levels under our revolving credit facility  and the availability of future debt and equity financing on satisfactory terms 
our ability to fund new opportunities and compete for and retain the qualified personnel necessary to conduct our business is also dependent upon our financial resources 
prolonged weakness in the global economy and in natural gas prices  which may affect both our cash flows and the value of our gas reserves  limitations on our ability to replace production through drilling activities  a material adverse change in our gas reserves due to factors other than changes in gas prices changes  our ability to transport our gas to markets  drilling costs  lower than expected production rates and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  may adversely affect our ability to fund our anticipated capital expenditures  pursue property acquisitions  and compete for qualified personnel  among other things 
changes in natural gas prices may significantly affect our revenues  financial condition  cash flows  natural gas reserves and borrowing capacity 
markets for natural gas have historically been volatile and we expect this trend to continue 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond our control 
we are unable to accurately predict the prices we will receive for our natural gas 
accordingly  any significant or sustained declines in natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  operating results  liquidity and ability to obtain financing 
declining or prolonged low natural gas prices may also result in non compliance with the covenants in our revolving credit facility agreement and could result in a lower determination of our borrowing base 
although we will attempt to cure any non compliance with covenants in our revolving credit facility in the event they occur  no assurance can be given that we will be able to cure such non compliance 
lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
further declines in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our proved natural gas reserves  our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and access to capital 
our capital expenditure budgets are highly dependent on future natural gas prices 
current business plan in the current natural gas pricing environment  the company intends to limit capital spending to its internally generated cash flows from operations 
accordingly  it is unlikely to consider any significant exploration activities until conditions improve  as such investments would likely not be economical 
we currently intend to drill our proved undeveloped locations in the pond creek field and to continue to conduct hydraulic fracturing in new infill wells or in behind pipe shallow zones in the gurnee field on a limited basis 
our current focus is to complete the developmental drilling program in the pond creek field and  in the gurnee 
table of contents field  improve production and determine the commerciality of future development through hydraulic fracturing techniques 
at current gas prices  it is unlikely that we would seek  nor could we obtain on reasonable terms  significant additional financing necessary to acquire additional properties or otherwise expand beyond our current developmental drilling and hydraulic fracturing programs 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in available borrowing capacity 
this business plan is consistent with our past actions taken in unfavorable pricing environments 
for example  when the price of natural gas declined precipitously at the end of  we stopped substantially all of our development activities  and in did not drill any new wells 
completion of rights offering and backstop transaction on september   the company issued and sold  shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock at per share 
after paying transaction fees and expenses in the amount of million  the company used the net proceeds of approximately million to reduce outstanding bank debt 
the preferred stock is senior to our common stock as to payment of dividends and distributions upon liquidation 
see liquidity and capital resources completion of rights offering and backstop transaction for additional information 
nasdaq deficiency letter on september   the company received a deficiency letter from the staff of the nasdaq stock market  advising the company that  for the previous consecutive business days  the bid price for the company s common stock had closed below the minimum per share required under nasdaq marketplace rule a for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
the notification letter stated that the company was afforded calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on january   the company received notice from the nasdaq stock market that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price per share required under nasdaq marketplace rule a and  as such  is in compliance for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  estimates  and a high degree of uncertainty in the preparation of our financial statements reserves 
our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved gas reserves 
proved gas reserves represent estimated quantities of gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production  and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering  and production data and  the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of changing market conditions  natural gas prices and future development costs will change from year to year  causing estimates of proved reserves to also change 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our unevaluated properties  our rate for 
table of contents recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by d m  independent petroleum engineers 
gas properties the method of accounting for gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expenses 
we use the full cost method of accounting for gas properties as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
under this method  all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of our gas properties are capitalized and segregated into us and canadian cost centers 
gas properties are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense is significantly affected by the unamortized historical and future development costs and the estimated proved gas reserves 
estimation of proved gas reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent proved reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
we perform a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of our full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
the ceiling test is imposed separately for our us and canadian cost centers 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less related deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling limitation test is calculated using natural gas prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for regional price differentials  held constant over the life of the reserves 
in addition  subsequent to the adoption of asc  the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations are not included in the computation of the discounted present value of future net revenues for the purposes of the ceiling limitation test calculation 
unevaluated properties the costs directly associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and relate to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of proved reserves together with overhead and interest costs capitalized for these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs associated with a specific unevaluated property are transferred to the amortization base with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
any impairment to unevaluated properties is transferred to the amortization base 
asset retirement liability we adopted asc  effective january  it establishes accounting and reporting standards for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets that result from the legal obligation to plug  abandon and dismantle existing wells and facilities that we have acquired  constructed or developed 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for asset retirement obligations be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  the asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 

table of contents income taxes we record our income taxes using an asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates at the end of the period 
under asc  the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted change 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment includes extensive analysis performed by the company at the end of each reporting period 
estimating the amount of valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in stockholder ownership that could trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
asc also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a consistent threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax asset recoverability our total net deferred tax asset at december  was million  which includes a valuation allowance of million 
our valuation allowance primarily relates to our canadian operations where we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our net deferred tax asset prior to expiration as well as certain immaterial state net operating losses where the company has ceased operations 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we considered the fact that we have recorded a cumulative  pretax loss of over the past three years 
this cumulative loss was the result of the company incurring a total of million in full cost ceiling test impairments during and the fourth quarter of relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income may be insufficient to overcome a history of such losses 
in developing our forecasts as to whether our net deferred tax asset would more likely than not be recovered  we considered the fact that there were no ceiling test impairments in  as well as the fact that the situation that contributed to the impairments was the unprecedented economic downtown which began in the fourth quarter of and resulted in the price of natural gas falling from a high of in the third quarter of to a low of in the fourth quarter of and to a further low of in the third quarter of in addition  we considered the fact that the current remaining capitalized costs plus planned future costs are significantly less than the historical ceiling test impairments and it is expected that future production will produce sufficient taxable income to cover these costs 
our first material net operating loss nol carryforward expires in and the last one expires in we also consider the lengthy carryforward period in the overall evaluation of our ability to realize our nols as it substantially increases the likelihood of utilization 
in order to test our net deferred tax asset for recoverability  we performed a historical based analysis by using our cumulative three year historical book loss and added back the historical book impairment and book depletion 
we used this three year historical average taxable income before tax depletion and intangible drilling cost amortization to project taxable income for the next years  which corresponds to our nol carry forward period 
we then reduced the total by the remaining book basis of our gas properties and projected future book basis 
in this analysis  our net deferred tax assets including all nols will be utilized prior to expiration 
we believe this analysis provides significant positive evidence that is objectively verifiable  as it uses three year historical operating results to predict future taxable income 
we have considered all applicable tax deductions in this analysis which are substantially known and are not subject to significant estimates 

table of contents in addition  we performed a forecast based analysis based on inputs from third party sources 
our primary inputs for this analysis come from our reserve report that is estimated and appraised by an independent third party engineer as well as future market pricing as determined by the new york mercantile exchange 
to test the sensitivity of the forecast  we adjusted several assumptions  including  but not limited to  the following use of three year historical average production  use of three year average pricing  and use of three year average margins 
under all scenarios  we generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize the net deferred tax asset prior to expiration 
the company will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted production  pricing  and margins are not achieved by amounts in excess of our sensitivity analysis  it may have a significant impact on the corresponding taxable income which may require a valuation allowance to be recorded against our then existing deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition and gas balancing 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas 
we use the sales method of accounting for the recognition of gas revenue whereby revenues  net of royalties  are recognized as the production is sold to purchaser 
the amount of gas sold may differ from the amount to which the company is entitled based on its working interest or net revenue interest in the properties 
we typically do not have any significant producer gas imbalance positions because we own working interest in the majority of our properties 
a ready market for natural gas allows us to sell our natural gas shortly after production at various pipeline receipt points at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on our nominations and net revenue interests 
pipeline imbalances occur when our production delivered into the pipeline varies from the gas we nominated for sale 
pipeline imbalances are settled with cash approximately thirty days after the month of production and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or increase of revenue depending upon whether we are over delivered or under delivered 
settlements of gas sales occur after the month in which the gas was produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period during which payments are received from the purchaser 
derivative instruments and hedging activities our hedging activities consist of derivative instruments entered into to hedge against changes in natural gas prices and changes in interest rates related to outstanding debt under our credit facility primarily through the use of fixed price swap agreements  basis swap agreements  three way collars  and traditional collars 
consistent with our hedging policy  we entered into a series of derivative instruments to hedge a significant portion of our expected natural gas production through we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge interest rates associated with a portion of our variable rate debt through typically  these derivative instruments require payments to receipts from counterparties based on specific indices as required by the derivative agreements 
these transactions are recorded in our consolidated audited financial statements in accordance with asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although not risk free  we believe this policy will reduce our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and changes in interest rates and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as a result  our derivative instruments are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in accordance with asc  as amended  all our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings for the natural gas derivatives or other comprehensive income loss for our interest rate swaps 
the natural gas derivatives have not been designated as hedge transactions while the interest rate swaps qualify and have been designated as such in accordance with asc at the inception of a derivative contract  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we document the relationship between the derivative instrument and 
table of contents the hedged items as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative instrument 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and hedge items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
mezzanine equity embedded derivative our series a convertible redeemable preferred stock has been classified within the mezzanine temporary equity section of the consolidated balance sheets because the shares are redeemable at the option of the holder and therefore do not qualify for permanent equity 
in addition  we evaluated the conversion feature and determined that because of certain anti dilution provisions  the conversion feature was not indexed to our stock and as such  the holder s conversion option was to be separated and recorded at fair value as a derivative liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative liability were recorded as a component of other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the derivative liability attributable to the conversion option was determined using an american binomial lattice model  which utilized assumptions including volatility  a discount factor and an expected term of years determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million to unrealized loss from change in fair value of derivative liability series a convertible redeemable preferred stock in the consolidated statements of operations as a result of the change in the fair value of the derivative liability 
on december   the company amended the terms of the preferred stock to adjust the anti dilution provision and further limit the company s ability to issue junior securities including additional shares of common stock  at a price lower than the current conversion price  without the consent of holders of a majority of shares of series a preferred stock 
after the amendment  the conversion feature is indexed to our stock and as such  is no longer required to be accounted for as a derivative 
on the effective date of the amendment  the bifurcated derivative liability on the company s consolidated balance sheet related to the conversion feature was reclassified to paid in capital on the company s consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
fair value measurement effective january   we adopted asc  formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are derived from unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
see disclosure related to the implementation of asc in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fasb has also issued staff position fas fsp  which delays the effective date of asc for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected to defer the application of asc thereof to nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with fsp non recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the company has not applied the provisions of asc include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of asc in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not 
table of contents active 
on january   we adopted asc as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  including nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination  impaired property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations 
there has been no significant impact to our consolidated audited financial statements related to the implementation of asc for our existing non financial assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the application of asc requires the use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  to measure the estimated fair value of the options and as a result various assumptions must be made by management that require judgment and the assumptions could be highly uncertain 
for share based awards outstanding prior to the adoption of asc  we will continue using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards before adoption 
therefore  we do not recognize any equity compensation cost on these prior awards in the future unless such awards are modified  repurchased or cancelled

gas sales increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the increase in gas sales was a result of higher natural gas prices  which increased approximately excluding hedging transactions  partially offset by a decrease related to production 
the decrease related to production was principally attributable to the normal production declines with no drilling in to offset such normal production declines 

table of contents lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the million decrease in lease operating expenses consisted of million decrease in costs and a million decrease related to production 
the million decrease in costs was primarily due to a company wide cost reduction strategy implemented in april compression expense 
compression expense decreased by million  or  to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the million decrease was comprised of million decrease in costs and a million decrease related to production 
the million decrease in costs was primarily due to a company wide cost reduction strategy implemented in april transportation expense 
transportation expense decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to the permanent release of excess transportation capacity effective may  production taxes 
production taxes decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease related to production taxes was primarily due to production tax refunds in the current year  partially offset by an increase in production taxes due to the phase in of state taxes on production of natural gas in the west virginia portion of our pond creek field 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the depreciation  depletion and amortization decrease consisted of a million decrease related to production and a million decrease in the depletion rate 
the decrease in the depletion rate was due to the ceiling write downs incurred throughout impairment of gas properties 
during  the carrying value of the company s gas properties did not exceed the full cost ceiling limitation 
as such  there was no such impairment recorded in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a company wide cost reduction strategy implemented in april terminated transaction costs 
during the current year  we incurred million of costs related to a proposed financing transaction with certain parties and million related to a potential sale of certain assets 
negotiations with those parties ceased and the related costs were expensed as terminated transaction costs 
no such expenses were incurred in the prior year 
realized gains on derivative contracts 
realized gains on derivative contracts decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
realized losses represent net cash flow settlements paid to the contract counterparty  while realized gains represent net cash flow settlements paid to us from the contract counterparty 
realized losses occur when natural gas prices exceed the derivative ceiling prices 
conversely  realized gains occur when natural gas prices go below the derivative floor prices 
unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized gains on open derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to unrealized losses of million in the prior year period 
unrealized gains and losses are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
interest expense 
interest expense remained materially unchanged compared to the prior year 
unrealized loss from the change in fair value of derivative liability series a convertible redeemable preferred stock 
the loss in was primarily the result of the increase in the market price of our common stock from the issuance date of our series a preferred stock of september  through the effective date of 
table of contents the amendment to series a preferred stock anti dilution feature 
the company amended the terms of the anti dilution provisions of its preferred stock on december  the effect of the amendment was to extinguish the liability and reclassify it to paid in capital 
future changes in the price of our common stock will not result in the recognition of gains or losses attributable to the anti dilution provisions of our preferred stock 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million in the current year as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the current year was 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was different than the amount computed using the statutory rate as follows us canada total amount computed using statutory rates state income taxes net of federal benefit valuation allowance nondeductible transaction costs other nondeductible items and other income tax provision year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following are selected items derived from our consolidated statement of operations and their percentage changes from the comparable period are presented below

gas sales decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in gas sales was a result of significantly lower natural gas prices  which decreased approximately excluding hedging transactions  partially offset by increased production  which increased 
the increase in production was principally attributable to the prior year development activities at our pond creek field and the commencement of gas sales in our garden city field in july  lasher field in october  and peace river in december  partially offset by the sale of an overriding royalty interest that was sold effective july  and decreased current year production in our gurnee field

lease operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the million decrease in lease operating expenses consisted of million 
table of contents decrease in costs  partially offset by a million increase in production 
the million decrease in costs was primarily due to a company wide cost reduction strategy implemented in april  partially offset by increased expenses related to the commencement of gas sales in our garden city field in july  lasher field in october  and peace river in december compression expense 
compression expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in compression expense was primarily due to the addition of peace river compression costs where gas sales commenced on december  transportation expense 
transportation expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to the fact that a greater amount of excess capacity was released in the prior year period effectively reducing transportation expense for that period 
the excess transportation capacity that caused the increase was permanently released in may as a result of this permanent release  we expect to incur less transportation costs in the future 
production taxes 
production taxes decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease related to production taxes was primarily due to decreased natural gas sales caused by lower natural gas prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the depreciation  depletion and amortization increase consisted of million in accelerated depletion caused by estimated natural gas reserve revisions recorded as of september   offset by a million decrease due to the decrease in the depletion rate resulting from our ceiling write downs incurred to date 
impairment of gas properties 
for the year ended december   impairments recorded to gas properties were million  net of tax benefit of million 
these impairments were caused by lower natural gas prices  as well as downward reserve revisions due in large part to continued under performance in the gurnee field 
we were able to limit the effect of lower natural gas prices through our ongoing cost reduction strategy  which we implemented in april general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the primary driver of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was the cost reduction strategy implemented in april  offset by million less capitalized overhead as a result of decreased drilling activities 
realized gains losses on derivative contracts 
realized gains on derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to realized losses of million in the prior year period 
realized losses represent net cash flow settlements paid to the contract counterparty  while realized gains represent net cash flow settlements paid to us from the contract counterparty 
realized losses occur when natural gas prices exceed the derivative ceiling prices 
conversely  realized gains occur when natural gas prices go below the derivative floor prices 
unrealized losses gains from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized losses on open derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to unrealized gains of million in the prior year period 
unrealized losses and gains are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase is due to the effect of a higher average outstanding debt balance in the current year period  partially offset by a lower average interest rate in the current year period 
additionally  the prior year included million of capitalized interest for which there was no comparable capitalized interest in the current year period as a result of no drilling activity 

table of contents income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increased benefit was primarily the result of the impairments recorded to gas properties of million  net of tax benefit of million 
these impairments were caused by lower natural gas prices  as well as downward revisions due in large part to continued under performance in the gurnee field 
we were able to limit the effect of lower natural gas prices through our ongoing cost reduction strategy  which we implemented in april the effective tax rate for the period was 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was different than the amount computed using the statutory rate as follows us canada total amount computed using statutory rates state income taxes net of federal benefit valuation allowance nondeductible items and other income tax benefit liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity cash flows provided by operations for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of less than million 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and other financial resources such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our projected capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
revolving credit facility on september   our fourth amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of five banks became effective 
the credit agreement replaced our third amended and restated credit agreement and provides for revolving credit borrowings of up to million with an initial borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base will be determined as of each june and december with the next determination scheduled to be completed by june all outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement become due and payable on september  the credit agreement provides for interest to accrue at a rate calculated  at the company s option  at the adjusted base rate plus a margin of to or the london interbank offered rate the libor rate rate plus a margin of to 
adjusted base rate is defined to be the greater of i the agent s base rate or ii the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent or iii the libor rate plus a margin of 
in all cases the applicable margin is dependent on the percentage of borrowing base usage 
under the credit agreement we are subject to certain financial covenants requiring maintenance of i a minimum current ratio  ii a maximum debt ratio and  iii depending on our debt ratio  either a a minimum interest coverage ratio or b a minimum fixed charge ratio 
the current ratio of consolidated current assets defined to include amounts available under our borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities defined to exclude up to million in accrued and unpaid preferred dividends is not permitted to be less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
at december   the current ratio  as defined  was 
the debt ratio defined as funded debt at the end of each fiscal quarter to trailing four quarter consolidated ebitda at the end of each fiscal quarter cannot exceed to through the quarter ending june  and to thereafter 
at december   the debt ratio  as defined  was 
if our debt ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter is above to  then the fixed charge ratio defined as consolidated ebitda less capital expenditures to consolidated net cash interest expense for the four preceding quarters is applicable and cannot be less than to at december   the fixed charge ratio  as 
table of contents defined  was 
if our debt ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter is to or less  the interest coverage ratio defined as consolidated ebitda to consolidated net cash interest expense plus letter of credit fees accruing during the preceding four quarters is applicable and cannot be less than 
at december   the fixed charge ratio  as defined  was 
consolidated ebitda is defined as earnings loss before deducting net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and also excludes non recurring charges and other non cash charges deducted in determining net income loss  which would include unrealized gains and losses from a change in the market value of open derivative contracts 
the company expects continued compliance with the aforementioned covenant in the near term 
we are also subject to covenants restricting or prohibiting cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities  and liens on properties 
cash dividends on our preferred stock are permitted if  following any such cash payment our availability is equal to or greater than of the then current borrowing base and our debt ratio is less than to there are no restrictions associated with the payment of pik dividends on our preferred stock 
completion of rights offering and backstop transaction on september   the company issued and sold  shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock preferred stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
after paying transaction fees and expenses in the amount of million  the company used the net proceeds of approximately million to reduce outstanding bank debt 
the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock as to payment of dividends and distribution upon liquidation 
dividends accrue quarterly on the preferred stock  including any preferred stock issued as paid in kind dividends pik dividends  which in our sole discretion  may be paid in any combination of cash  or  until the fifth anniversary of the closing of the rights offering  in pik dividends 
the applicable annual rate for dividends paid in cash is for the first three years and thereafter 
the applicable annual rate for pik dividends is 
all dividends are cumulative and all unpaid dividends compound on a quarterly basis at a annual rate 
at december   an additional  shares of our preferred stock are reserved exclusively for the payment of pik dividends 
the preferred stock is immediately convertible into common stock  at the sole option of the holder  at an initial conversion price of per common share as it may be adjusted from time to time  the conversion price 
the preferred stock converts into a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing i the sum of a plus b accrued but unpaid dividends by ii the conversion price 
at the current conversion price  up to an additional  shares of our common stock would be outstanding immediately after conversion of our preferred stock 
the conversion price and resulting number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of preferred stock is adjusted to reflect stock splits and similar events and is entitled to anti dilution adjustments for any dividends paid on common stock in cash or in common stock  the issuance of additional equity securities at a price less than the conversion price excluding shares  rights and options subject to certain employee benefit arrangements  and the occurrence of certain material corporate transactions at a per share valuation less than the conversion price 
at any time beginning eight years from the date of issuance  the preferred stock is redeemable  in whole or in part  at the sole option of the holder 
the purchase price per share  payable in cash  will be equal to the sum of the original purchase price and any accrued and unpaid dividends 
we have the option  beginning three years from the date of issuance  to convert the preferred stock into our common stock at the then current conversion price  subject to certain volume and other limitations 
in order for us to exercise this option  the daily volume weighted average trading price of our common stock must be greater than of the then current conversion price for twenty out of the previous thirty trading days 

table of contents the holders of the preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters on which the holders of our common stock are entitled to vote 
the holders of the preferred stock generally vote together with the holders of the common stock as a single class  with the preferred stock holders entitled to the number of votes such holders would have on an as converted basis 
certain actions also require a separate vote of the preferred stock 
upon the occurrence of a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company resulting in a payment or distribution of assets to the holders of any of our capital stock each such event  a liquidation event  the holders of the preferred stock including pik dividends are entitled to receive  prior and in preference to any payment  or segregation for payment  of any consideration to any holder of any junior security of the company  an amount in cash equal to the greater of i per share  plus any accrued but unpaid dividends in each case adjusted for any stock dividends  splits  combinations or similar events  or ii an amount equal to the amount such holders of the preferred stock would have received upon the liquidation event if they had converted their shares of preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
if not converted  the preferred stock including any pik dividends is redeemable by us on or at any time after a liquidation event 
in the absence of a liquidation event  if not converted  a holder of preferred stock including any pik dividends may cause us to redeem the preferred stock held by such holder  in whole or in part  on or after september   upon days prior written notice to us 
upon any redemption of preferred stock by us  as of the effective date of the redemption  we will pay to each holder of preferred stock  per share of preferred stock including any pik dividends held plus any accrued but unpaid dividends in each case adjusted for any stock dividends  splits  combinations or similar events 
during the year ended december   the company declared and issued pik dividends of  shares to the holders of preferred stock 
the preferred stock has been classified within the mezzanine temporary equity section of the consolidated balance sheets because the shares are redeemable at the option of the holder and therefore do not qualify for permanent equity 
the preferred stock balance in mezzanine equity will be accreted to its redemption value over the eight year redemption period 
in addition  we evaluated the conversion feature at september  and determined that its terms required the holder s conversion option to be separated and recorded at fair value as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative liability were recorded as a component of other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the derivative liability attributable to the conversion option was determined using an american binomial lattice model  which utilized assumptions including volatility  a discount factor and an expected term of years determined using a monte carlo simulation model  and resulted in a fair value of approximately million on the date of issuance 
the remaining net proceeds of million were allocated to series a convertible redeemable preferred stock in the consolidated balance sheets 
for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million to unrealized loss from change in fair value of derivative liability series a convertible redeemable preferred stock in the consolidated statements of operations as a result of the change in the fair value of the derivative liability 
on december   the company amended the terms of the preferred stock to adjust the anti dilution provision and further limit the company s ability to issue junior securities including additional shares of common stock  at a price lower than the current conversion price  without the consent of holders of a majority of shares of series a preferred stock 
the preferred stock initially contained an anti dilution provision that was triggered when the company issued certain additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock for consideration per share less than the conversion price of the preferred stock 
the anti dilution provision was amended during so that  in the event of such issuance  the conversion price of the preferred stock will be reduced to a price determined by multiplying the then current conversion price by a fraction a the numerator of which will be the 
table of contents sum of i the number of shares of common stock outstanding  on a fully diluted basis  before the additional issuance plus ii the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company for the additional issuance would purchase at the conversion price then in effect  and b the denominator of which will be the sum of x the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the additional issuance plus y the number of such additional shares of common stock that were actually issued 
in addition  the terms of the preferred stock was amended to prohibit the company from issuing any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock for consideration per share with regard to securities convertible into common stock  on an as converted basis less than the then current conversion price of the series a preferred stock without the prior vote or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock  for so long as at least  shares of series a preferred stock remain outstanding 
we amended the terms of the preferred stock because we believed that the valuation  accounting and disclosure obligations associated with the embedded derivative were burdensome and that such accounting treatment did not clearly represent the overall financial condition and results of operations of the company 
determining the periodic change in the fair value of the derivative liability required a costly valuation each quarter and produced significant volatility in the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the valuation required level inputs and assumptions  under asc  for reporting purposes  and was considered a critical accounting area which includes a high degree of judgment and uncertainty 
on the effective date of the amendment  december   the bifurcated derivative liability on the company s consolidated balance sheet related to the conversion feature was reclassified to paid in capital on the company s consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
in addition  we will no longer experience the potential volatility on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations from unrealized gains or losses resulting from future fair value fluctuations of the extinguished derivative liability 
as a result  we expect our consolidated financial statements to be more consistent with the underlying operations of the company

table of contents issuance costs of  were incurred as part of the issuance of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock 
as the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock was bifurcated on the consolidated balance sheet as disclosed in the table above   of the issuance costs were allocated to mezzanine equity series a convertible redeemable preferred stock 
the remaining  of issuance costs were allocated to other current assets and other noncurrent assets to be amortized over the term of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock and  as a result of the amendment to the preferred stock agreement on december    of original issuance costs  less  amortized in were reclassified to equity 
capital expenditures the following table is a summary of our capital expenditures on an accrual basis by category year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures leasehold acquisition exploration development other items primarily capitalized overhead total capital expenditures we expect our capital expenditure budget for to be million 
the amount and timing of our expenditures are subject to change based upon market conditions  natural gas prices  results of operations and other factors 
we routinely adjust our capital expenditure budget in response to changes in natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  cash flow  drilling results and changes in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the development of coalbed methane fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  the transportation alternatives  and the timing and rate of initial and subsequent natural gas production volumes 
changes in natural gas prices significantly affect our revenues  financial condition  cash flows and borrowing capacity 
markets for natural gas have historically been volatile and we expect this trend to continue 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond our control 
we are unable to accurately predict the prices we will receive for our natural gas 
accordingly  any significant or sustained declines in natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  operating results  liquidity and ability to obtain financing 
continued or prolonged low natural gas prices may also result in non compliance with the covenants in our revolving credit facility agreement and could result in a lower determination of our borrowing base 
lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
further declines in natural gas prices have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our proved natural gas reserves  our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and access to capital 
our capital expenditure budgets are highly dependent on future natural gas prices 
natural gas price risk and related hedging activities the energy markets have historically been volatile  and there can be no assurance that future natural gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging natural gas prices from time to time 
table of contents primarily using derivative instruments in the form of three way collars  traditional collars and swaps 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable price movements 
our price risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
we enter into hedging transactions  generally for forward periods up to two years or more  which increase the probability of achieving our targeted level of cash flows 
we generally limit the amount of these hedges during any period to no more than to of the then expected gas production for such future periods 
swaps exchange floating price risk in the future for a fixed price at the time of the hedge 
costless collars set both a maximum ceiling a sold ceiling and a minimum floor a bought floor future price 
three way costless collars are similar to regular costless collars except that  in order to increase the ceiling price  we agree to limit the amount of the floor price protection through a sold floor to a predetermined amount  generally between and per mmbtu below the bought floor 
we have accounted for these transactions using the mark to market accounting method 
generally  we incur accounting losses on derivatives during periods where prices are rising and gains during periods where prices are falling which may cause significant fluctuations in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
commodity price risk and related hedging activities at december   we had the following natural gas collar positions period volume mmbtu sold ceiling bought floor sold floor fair value january through march at december   we had the following natural gas swap positions period volume mmbtu fixed price fair value january through march january through march april through october april through october april through october november through march november through march november through march april through october april through october november through march november through march 
table of contents our production is sold at an all in price which includes the market price for natural gas plus a basis differential 
in january  we agreed to sell gross volumes of  mmbtu day of natural gas from our pond creek field for the period february through march through a forward physical sale contract with our existing purchaser at a price equal to the last day settlement price for the nymex contract for the month of sale plus a basis differential of   and for the periods february through march  april through october  and november through march  respectively 
gross sales from the pond creek field averaged approximately  mmbtu day for the year ended december  as such  the overall delivery agreement represents approximately of the average gross daily sales 
additionally  we fixed the nymex settle on a portion of the aforementioned forward sale as follows period volume mmbtu fixed market price fixed basis differential all in price gross sale april through october november through march the remaining volumes giving effect for the fixed amounts denoted above are as follows period volume mmbtu fixed basis differential february through march april through october november through march interest rate risks and related hedging activities when we enter into an interest rate swap  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge  at which time we prepare the documentation required under asc hedges of our interest rate are designated as cash flow hedges based on whether the interest on the underlying debt is converted to a fixed interest rate 
changes in derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as other comprehensive income or loss to the extent that they are effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
we use fixed rate swaps to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the objective of realizing a fixed cash flow stream from these activities 
at december   we had the following interest rate swaps description effective date designated maturity date fixed rate notional amount fair value floating to fixed swap the floating rate paid by the counterparty is the british bankers association libor rate 

table of contents contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business  debt service requirements and operating lease commitments 
the following table summarizes these commitments at december   beginning january  in thousands and thereafter long term debt and other obligations interest expense on revolving credit facility operating lease obligations interest rate swap contracts asset retirement obligations firm transportation contracts asc formerly fin total commitments maturities based on the september amended bank credit agreement terms  as amended  which extended the maturity date to september  the outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility bear interest at the company s option of either a the adjusted base rate  which is the greatest of i the agent s base rate  ii the federal funds rate plus  or iii the libor rate plus a margin of  plus a margin of to  or b the libor rate  plus a margin of to  based on borrowing base usage 
the rate at december   excluding the effect of our interest rate swaps  was 
as of december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amount of any payments related to this liability because there are currently no outstanding unpaid assessments from any tax authority  and it is likely that assessments would be offset by existing deferred tax attributes as they arise 
the following were maturities of long term debt for each of the next five years at december  year amount thereafter total debt in january  we agreed to sell gross volumes of  mmbtu day of natural gas from our pond creek field for the period february through march through a forward physical sale contract with our existing purchaser at a price equal to the last day settlement price for the nymex contract for the month of sale plus   and for the periods february through march  april through october  and november through march  respectively 
additionally  we fixed the nymex settle on a portion of the aforementioned forward sale as follows  mmbtu day for the period april through october was fixed at a total price for physical gas sales  including the aforementioned basis  of mmbtu and  mmbtu day for the period november through march was fixed at a total price for physical gas sales  including the aforementioned basis  of mmbtu 
these contracted volumes represent approximately of total expected gross production volumes for the contract period from the pond creek field 
if we are unable to fulfill our commitment  or a portion thereof  we are obligated to reimburse our counterparty 
table of contents for any price paid to replace the quantity of natural gas we failed to deliver which is in excess of the contract price 
this obligation is limited to the spot price for natural gas at the delivery point on the day we fail to deliver 
operating lease commitments we have operating leases for office space  office equipment and field compressors expiring in various years through future minimum lease commitments as of december  under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows year ended december  amount thereafter total future minimum lease commitments total rental expenses under operating leases were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
transportation contracts as of december   under the following firm transportation contracts  we can transport maximum daily volumes of mmbtu s continuing until october    mmbtu s continuing until april   and  mmbtu s continuing until april  we have a right to extend each of these contracts  in five year increments  at the maximum tariff rate 
as of december   the maximum commitment remaining under the transportation contracts is approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued release no 
 modernization of oil and gas reporting asc  which amended the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in regulations s k and s x  and added a section to regulation s k subpart to codify the revised disclosure requirements in securities act industry guide  which was eliminated 
the goal of release no 
is to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
companies affected by release no 
are now required to price estimated proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the month period prior to the end of the reporting period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based on future conditions 
sec release no 
is effective beginning for financial statements for fiscal years ending on or after december  the company adopted sec release no

this update provides amendments to subtopic and requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of level and level and the reasons for such transfers and activity in level fair value measurements to show separate information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
in addition  this update amends subtopic to clarify existing disclosures around the disaggregation level of fair value measurements and disclosures for the valuation techniques and inputs utilized for level and level fair value measurements 
the provisions in asu are applicable to interim and annual reporting periods beginning subsequent to december   with the exception of level disclosures of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements  which will be required in reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not impact the company s operating results  financial position or cash flows  but did impact the company s disclosures on fair value measurements 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated audited financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended december   a decrease in the prices received for natural gas production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues  which would have been offset by approximately million realized gas hedging gains 
interest rate risk 
we have long term debt subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the rates at december  and  excluding the effect of our interest rate swaps  were and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  interest on the borrowings averaged per annum and per annum  respectively 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility accrues interest at floating or market rates 
fluctuations in market interest rates will cause our interest costs to fluctuate 
based upon the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for the year ended december   a increase in market interest rates would have increased interest expense and negatively impacted our annual cash flows by approximately million 
million of the outstanding balance was excluded from our market rate analysis due to lack of interest rate exposure based on the interest rate swaps we have in place 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in canada and do not have operations in any other foreign countries 
we do not hedge our foreign currency risk and are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the canadian dollar 
our canadian prospect is temporarily shut in and  therefore  the impact on our consolidated financial statements is not significant 
we will continue to monitor the foreign currency exchange rate in canada and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk in the future
