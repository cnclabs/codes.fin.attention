overview document security systems markets and sells products designed to protect valuable information from unauthorized scanning  copying  and digital imaging 
we have developed security technologies that are applied during the normal printing process and by all printing methods including traditional offset  gravure  flexo  digital or via the internet on paper  plastic  or packaging 
our technologies and products are used by federal  state and local governments  law enforcement agencies and are also applied to a broad variety of industries as well  including financial institutions  high technology and consumer goods  entertainment and gaming  healthcare pharmaceutical  defense and genuine parts industries 
our customers use our technologies where there is a need for enhanced security for protecting and verification of critical financial instruments and vital records  or where there are concerns of counterfeiting  fraud  identity theft  brand protection and liability 
we have developed or acquired over technologies that provide to our customers a wide spectrum of solutions 
we hold numerous patents  patent pendings  trademarks and trade secrets that form the basis of our security technology offerings 
our competitive position in the security printing market is based largely on our attention to the research and development of technologies  ideas and know how that combat a widening range of copying  scanning and other duplication devices that exist in today s market that can be used for counterfeiting and unauthorized duplication of sensitive information and images 
we sell our products under the authentiguard name generally in the following ways a as generic products  including safety paper and plastic cards geared for the end user market for printed security products  b as custom printed products  c as technology licenses  or d as customized digital implementations 
prior to  the company s primary revenue source in its document security division was derived from the licensing of its technology 
the company had limited production capabilities 
in  the company began to expand our ability to be a provider of anti counterfeiting products that utilize our anti counterfeiting technologies 
in  we acquired p  a privately held plastic cards manufacturer located in the san francisco  ca area 
p s primary focus is manufacturing long life composite  laminated and surface printed cards which can include magnetic stripes  bar codes  holograms  signature panels  invisible ink  micro fine printing  guilloche patterns  biometric  rfid and a patent pending watermark technology 
p s products are marketed through an extensive broker network that covers much of north america  europe and south america and by manufacturing for various industry integrators 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of dpi of rochester  llc  a privately held commercial printer located in rochester  ny 
we formed dpi to incorporate this new company which significantly improved our ability to produce our security paper products as well as improving our competitiveness in the market for custom security printing  especially in the areas of vital records  secure coupons  transcripts  and prescription paper along with the ability to offer our customers a wider range of commercial printing offerings 
in february  the company acquired premier packaging  a privately held packaging company located in the rochester ny area 
premier packaging is an iso registered manufacturer of custom paperboard packaging serving clients in the pharmaceutical  beverage  photo packaging  toy  specialty foods and direct marketing industries  among others 
the company expects the acquisition will allow it to introduce anti counterfeiting products to the packaging market that further expands the usage of its technologies 
the company believes that the ability to deter and prevent counterfeiting of brand packaging will provide major benefits to companies around the globe who are affected by product counterfeiting 
in the past few years  we have divested two operations so that we could focus our efforts on security and commercial printing 
during  we sold the assets of our retail printing and copying division  called patrick printing 
in october  we sold the assets and liabilities associated with legalstore in exchange for  shares of common stock of internet media services 
in october  we distributed our shares of internet media services in the form of a dividend to our shareholders 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and the following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
in october  the company sold legalstore 
in accordance with fasb asc  the company reported the results of legalstore as continued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component have not been eliminated given the company s continued involvement after the sale as a shareholder in internet media services  the purchaser of legalstore 
in october  we distributed our shares of internet media services in the form of a dividend to our shareholders 
in february  we acquired premier packaging  a  packaging company based in victor  ny  approximately miles from rochester  ny  our headquarters 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report 
revenue year ended december  year ended december  change revenue security and commercial printing packaging technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total revenue revenue revenue in increased from security and commercial print sales decreased  primarily due to decreases in commercial printing orders from the company s dpi division 
the company experienced lower orders from certain customers as a result of the change in the company s market focus 
generally  the company is seeking to reduce its overall commercial printing business and focus more of its printing on security printing opportunities 
furthermore  the company utilized a portion of it press time on printing for its newly acquired packaging company  which resulted in lower external print sales 
packaging sales were million for the ten and one half month period from february  to december  during  the company focused on streamlining operations between its security printing  commercial printing and packaging division to strengthen its competitive position in the markets it sells to and generate cost savings and synergies 
during  the company had approximately  as opposed to  in of intercompany sales which were eliminated for consolidated reporting 
the company s technology license revenue declined as usage by its largest licensee declined 
the company continues to seek long term licensing partners  however  we primarily focus our sales and business development efforts on end user solutions for our customers 
furthermore  during  the company did not have any legal product sales as this division was sold in october gross profit year ended december  year ended december  change costs of revenue security and commercial printing packaging technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total cost of revenue gross profit security and commercial printing packaging technology license royalties and digital solutions legal products total gross profit year ended december  year ended december  change gross profit percentage gross profit gross profit was flat between and  which was primarily due to the significant decrease in the gross profits generated from the company s security and commercial printing as a result of decreases in sales at the company s commercial printing division  which more than offset the increase in gross profits as a result of the company s packaging division which the company acquired in february in addition  the company did not have any gross profits from legal product sales as the division was sold in the fourth quarter of the company s gross profit percentage decrease for as compared to reflects the larger weight that packaging sales  which typically carry a lower gross profit margin  have on the company s overall revenue areas  along with the weakness in commercial printing sales 
the company expects that the impact of the company s acquisition of it packaging division will be to decrease overall gross profit margins for at least the near future  especially as the number of non security packaging projects out number the security packaging projects  which the company expects will be at higher profit margins 
operating expenses year ended december  year ended december  change operating expenses sales  general and administrative compensation professional fees sales and marketing research and development rent and utilities other other operating expenses depreciation and software amortization stock based compensation impairment of patents amoritization of intangibles   total operating expenses sales  general and administrative compensation costs were lower in as compared to  which reflects the impact of the addition of approximately  of sg a compensation expense from the packaging division the company acquired in february otherwise  sg a compensation costs would have decreased during as compared to as the result of staff reductions made by the company throughout and in early primarily in its commercial printing division 
professional fees in increased in due to increases in legal fees primarily associated with legal costs associated with the company s various business development and contractual activities  along with an increase in consulting costs 
in february of  the company hired an in house general counsel in an effort to reduce its overall legal costs in and beyond 
sales and marketing costs during increased from due to sales and marketing at the company s premier packaging division as well as an increase in marketing efforts and trade show participation for its security printing and plastic printing divisions in based on expectations that the sales downturn the company had experienced during the global recession was reversing 
research and development costs consist primarily of compensation costs for research personnel and direct costs for the use of third party printers facilities to test our technologies on equipment that we do not have access to internally 
research and development costs decreased due to a reduction in compensation cost 
rent and utilities increased as a result of the acquisition of premier packaging in february other operating expenses are primarily equipment maintenance and repairs  office supplies  it support  bad debt expense and insurance costs 
during  these costs decreased which was primarily the result of a one time write off of previously accrued estimated expenses of approximately  that were never incurred and a write off of previous accrued expenses that never transpired 
this more than offset increases in other expenses of  associated with the company s packaging division  which the company acquired in february stock based compensation expense in was  as compared to  of stock based compensation expense in which reflected the effect of reversals of previously recorded stock based compensation expense for stock options and restricted shares issued to the company s employees which terminated unvested due to employee terminations that occurred during the first quarter of the stock based compensation expense included options granted to employees at premier packaging when the company acquired it in february  and to certain senior management  along with stock based compensation expense related to warrants issued to third parties for consulting services 
impairment of patent acquisition costs of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of adverse decisions in the company s patent infringement case against the ecb which caused the company to reduce the estimated cash flows that supported the company s capitalized patent acquisition based intangible asset 
amortization of intangibles expense decreased in  as compared to the as a result of the reduction in the company s net capitalized patent acquisition and defense costs asset  partially offset by increases in amortization of other intangible expense of new other intangibles acquired during the company s acquisition of premier packaging in february other income and expenses year ended december  year ended december  change other income expense interest income interest expense amortizaton of note discount loss in equity investment gain on deconsolidation of legalstore 
com division gain on foreign currency transactions litigation settlements registration rights penalties other income other expense  net interest expense during  interest expense increased as a result of the increased debt carried by the company due to its use of a term note to help fund the company s acquisition of premier packaging in february along with the use of a revolving line of credit to fund the working capital needs of premier packaging 
amortization of note discount during  the company entered into two convertible notes that had conversion features at below fair value and therefore  a beneficial conversion feature 
accordingly  the company determined that a total of approximately  of note discount had been created as a result of the beneficial conversion features and a warrant issued with the debt 
the company was amortizing this expense over the expected life of the convertible notes 
on november   the holder exercised the conversion feature of the  convertible note for  shares of common stock  par value which retired the debt in full 
in conjunction with the conversion  the company recognized approximately  of note discount expense 
on december   the holder of the note exercised the conversion feature of the  convertible note for  shares of common stock  par value which retired the debt in full 
in conjunction with the conversion  the company recognized approximately  of note discount expense 
during  the company also recognized the amortization of note discount expense of approximately  for warrants that were issued in conjunction with the secured promissory note which had a fair value of approximately  gain on deconsolidation of legalstore division in october  the company sold legalstore for a non controlling interest ownership interest in internet media services 
the company recognized a gain on the transaction of approximately  as the estimated fair value of consideration received in exchange for the assets and liabilities sold exceeded the company s book value of the assets and liabilities 
the company accounted for the deconsolidation of the business by recognizing a gain in net income  measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received  which in the company s case was a equity interest in internet media services over the book value of the assets and liabilities transferred 
the company determined that the consideration received was not readily measurable because there was no activity in internet media services shares prior to the transaction 
therefore  the company determined that the value of the business transferred was more readily measurable by determining the fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
loss in equity investment the company recognized gains or losses on its investment in internet media services  the entity that purchased legalstore from the company in october under the equity method of accounting for investments 
during  the company recorded a cumulative loss in its investment of  on september   the company s board of directors declared a dividend pursuant to which the company distributed to its stockholders of record on october  on a pro rata basis an aggregate of  shares of common stock of internet media services 
as a result  the company has recorded a dividend of approximately  which was the book value of the investment as of september  litigation settlements on december   the company reached an agreement to issue  shares of common stock valued at approximately  and  of common stock warrants valued at approximately  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  for the purchase of common shares at per share in connection with the settlement of certain litigation between the company and the recipients 
the shares and common stock warrants were recorded at the aggregate estimated fair value of  registration rights penalties during  the company recorded expense of approximately  for the fair value of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at issuable to printer s llc as a result of the company s failure to file a registration statement under the terms of the  convertible note issued by the company in december other income the company received  during and  during for new york state qualified emerging technology company qetc refundable tax credits for the tax years ended    and net loss and loss per share year ended december  year ended december  change net loss net loss per share  basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding  basic and diluted net loss and loss per share during  the company experienced a net loss of million  a increase from the net loss of the increase reflects the impact of certain non recurring items such as the impairment asset charge of  the company recorded in the fourth quarter of   of accelerated note discount expense recorded by the company as a result of the conversion of certain debt instruments  and a significant increase in stock based compensation as compared to in addition  in  the company had significant non recurring income associated with the receipt of tax credits 
furthermore  in  the company acquired premier packaging  which increased the non cash depreciation expense and amortization expense  as the result of the recognition of the fair value of equipment and intangible assets acquired  by approximately  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows and other key indicators of liquidity are summarized as follows year ended december  year ended december  change vs 
cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities working capital current ratio x x cash and cash equivalents funds available from open credit facilities debt excluding unamortized debt discount and capitalized leases we have historically met our liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the private placement of equity securities and debt financings 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing an increase over our december  cash position of  the increase in the company s cash position was due to the  sale of equity to fletcher that the company made on december  operating cash flow during  the company used approximately million of cash for operations  a increase from our use of cash for operations in  which generally reflected the company s paydown of accounts payables and accrued expenses and timing of cash flows from its packaging division  which received approximately  in cash payments from customers in early january that otherwise would have reflected an improvement in operating cash flows in as compared to investing cash flow during  the company used approximately million for the acquisition of premier packaging 
the company made the acquisition of premier packaging as part of the implementation of its long term strategy to increase its ability to offer end user customers of secure documents and related product  with brand protection packaging specifically targeted with the premier packaging acquisition 
in addition  the company spent approximately  on equipment additions and patent related costs 
as the company becomes more of a manufacturer of security products  it expects to continue to see an increase in its capital expenditures for plant and equipment 
in addition  as the company continues to focus on the research and development of anti counterfeiting technologies  techniques and products  it anticipates continuing to spend capital on patents 
financing cash flows during  the company raised net proceeds through the sale of equity of approximately million  of which approximately million was raised on december  proceeds from these equity sales were used to provide some of the funding for an acquisition  make investments in fixed assets and in the company s patent portfolio  and to fund working capital 
in addition  the company borrowed  on a five year term note to fund its acquisition of premier packaging in february as of december   the company had approximately  in cash  primarily the result of its equity funding 
future capital needs as of december   the company has approximately  in cash and  available to it under one credit facility  along with up to  available under a credit line at its premier packaging subsidiary 
while the company s working capital position has significantly improved since december   the company continued to incur operating losses during  and therefore the company will likely use its cash on hand to fund its operations until it can consistently generate positive cash flow from its operations 
in addition  the company has approximately million of debt  of which approximately million is current  which may require the use of its cash on hand in order to pay 
while the company believes that its cash on hand will provide it sufficient resources in order to fund its operations and meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months  if the company cannot generate sufficient cash from its operations in the future  the company may need to raise additional funds in order to fund its working capital needs and pursue its growth strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  stock based compensation valuations  the valuation of intangible assets  and allocation of assets in business combinations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but are combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
the company has three reporting units with goodwill based on the current structure 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and performs annual assessments 
other intangible assets and patent defense costs other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application  acquisition and defense of the company s patents  contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company s technologies  a non exclusive licensing agreement  and customer lists obtained as a result of acquisitions 
the company s patents and trade secrets are for document anti counterfeiting and anti scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company s document security business 
patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent  which generally approximates its legal life 
external legal costs incurred to defend the company s patents are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patents and an expected successful outcome 
patent defense costs are expensed at the point when it is determined that the outcome is expected to be unsuccessful 
the company capitalizes the cost of an appeal until it is determined that the appeal will be unsuccessful 
the company s capitalized patent defense costs expenses are analyzed for impairment based on the expected eventual outcome of the legal action and recoverability of proceeds or added economic value of the patent in excess of the costs 
legal actions related to the same patent defense case are unified into one asset group for the purposes on the impairment analysis 
the company amortizes its other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over the remaining legal life  up to years 
intangible asset amortization expense is generally classified as an operating expense 
the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process 
the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense  unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product 
to date  the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material 
impairment of patent acquisition costs of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of adverse decisions in the company s patent infringement case against the ecb which caused the company to reduce the estimated cash flows that supported the company s capitalized patent acquisition based intangible asset 
conventional convertible debt when the convertible feature of the conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value  this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
prior to the determination of the bcf  the proceeds from the debt instrument were first allocated between the convertible debt and any embedded or detachable free standing instruments that are included  such as common stock warrants 
we record a bcf as a debt discount pursuant to fasb asc topic in those circumstances  the convertible debt will be recorded net of the discount related to the bcf 
we amortize the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method 
revenue recognition sales of security and commercial printing products  packaging and legal products are recognized when a product or service is delivered  shipped or provided to the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed 
for digital solutions sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with the fasb asc accordingly  revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service or product has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable the collection of our fees is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue from technology licenses once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the right and ability to use the product or technology has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
business combinations the company adopted the new fasb guidance on business combinations and non controlling interests 
the new guidance on business combinations retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued standard in that the acquirer of a business is required to account for the business combination at fair value 
as under previous guidance  the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the new pronouncement results in some changes to the method of applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in a number of significant aspects 
under the new guidance  all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
share based payments we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services the company determines the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table 
volatility expected option term years years risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
fasb asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis a valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
investment valuation and deconsolidation on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with internet media services whereby the company sold the assets and liabilities of legalstore  a division of the company  in exchange for  shares of common stock of internet media services 
the company recorded its investment in internet media services as an equity method investment at the fair market value of the business sold 
management determined that the transaction did not qualify as a non monetary exchange due to the exception noted in fasb asc 
a transfer of assets to an entity in exchange for an equity interest in that entity 
management determined that the transaction qualified as a derecoginition of a subsidiary under fasb asc therefore  the company accounted for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary the business by recording the consideration received at fair market value and recognizing a gain in net income measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received  shares of common stock of internet media services or a interest and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold 
given that the consideration received is not readily measurable because of the lack of activity in internet media services shares prior to the transaction  the company determined that the value of the business transferred is more readily measurable by determining the fair market value of the business transferred based on a discounted cash flow model 
the company is recording the equity method investment at fair value 
under the equity method investment the company is required to account for the difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary 
if the investor is unable to relate the difference to specific accounts of the investee eg  property and equipment  the difference should be considered to be the same as goodwill 
investors should not amortize goodwill associated with equity method investments after the date fasb asc is initially applied by the entity in its entirety 
the company has determined that given the lack of activity in internet media services shares prior to the transaction  the difference between the cost of the investment fair market value and the underlying equity interest is attributable to goodwill 
the company is continuing to report the activity in operating loss and not breaking out and reporting it as discontinued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component have not been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the equity method investment and because the company has significant continuing involvement in the operations of internet media services after the disposal transaction because of its ownership percentage and board representation 
on september   the company s board of directors declared a dividend which provided for the distribution by the company to its stockholders of record on october   on a pro rata basis  of its  shares of stock in internet media services 
the dividend was recorded at approximately  which was the book value of the investment as of september  fair value of financial instruments effective january   the company adopted the new accounting guidance relating to fair value measurements as required by the fair value measurement topic of the asc for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis and effective january  on a non recurring basis 
the new accounting guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value measurement topic of the asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions  such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information 
one of the company derivative instruments is an interest rate swap that changes a variable rate into a fixed rate on the term loan and qualifies as a cash flow hedge and is included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings 
when the hedged item is realized  gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci to the consolidated statement of operations on the same line item as the underlying transaction 
the cumulative net loss attributable to this cash flow hedge recorded in aocl at december   was approximately  the company accounts for warrants and other rights to acquire capital stock with exercise price reset features  or down round provisions  as derivative liabilities 
similarly  anti dilution provisions for issuances of common stock are also accounted for as derivative liabilities 
these derivative liabilities are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value at the end of each period reflected in current period income or loss 
the fair value of derivative liabilities is estimated using a binomial model or monte carlo simulation to model the financial characteristics  depending on the complexity of the derivative being measured 
a monte carlo simulation provides a more accurate valuation than standard option valuation methodologies such as the black scholes or binomial option models when derivatives include changing exercise prices or different alternatives depending on average future price targets 
in computing the fair value of the derivatives  the company uses significant judgments  which  if incorrect  could have a significant negative impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the input values for determining the fair value of the derivatives include observable market indices such as interest rates  and equity indices as well as unobservable model specific input values such as certain volatility parameters
