the company also recorded a million non cash unrealized gain on derivatives million net of tax effects 
net of both the non cash impairment and the non cash unrealized gain on derivatives the company would have recorded an adjusted net income of million 
the company realized revenues of million in compared to million in and million in revenues increased million from due to an increase in oil prices in kansas as prices averaged in compared to in and increased million due to volume increases in kansas oil sales 
in addition  revenues from the methane project increased million in over levels 
the average price received for kansas oil sales in was 
gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  per mcf in  and per mcf in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged in  per barrel in  and per barrel in production costs and taxes was million in  million in  and million in the increase in over levels was primarily related to increased well repair and maintenance cost in kansas  increased kansas property taxes  and increased landfill costs 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization for was million  million in  and million in the company s general and administrative cost was million in  million in  and million in the  and cost included non cash charges related to stock options of million  million  and million respectively 
the increase in general and administrative cost from to were related primarily to million of bonuses paid to company employees 
interest expense was million in  million in  and million in during  the company recorded a million gain on derivatives 
the gain was composed of a million unrealized gain partially offset by million of settlement payments made to macquarie 
in  the company recorded a million unrealized loss on derivatives 
see note derivatives and note fair value measurement for additional information related to the derivative transaction and the valuation of this transaction 
during  the company recorded a million million net of tax effect non cash writedown of its pipeline asset 
this writedown resulted from the company s assessment that cash flows generated from the pipeline were insufficient to recover the pipeline s net book value 
during the fourth quarter of the company received expressions of interest from potential purchasers of the pipeline asset which were significantly below the asset s pre writedown net book value of million 
these expressions of interest indicated that the carrying amount of the pipeline may not be recoverable 
during  the company recorded an million non cash ceiling test writedown of its oil and gas properties 
this writedown resulted from a significant reduction of the company s proved reserve value as of december  due to low year end oil prices 
the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of million in  a deferred tax benefit of million in  and million benefit in with million recognized as income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a revolving credit facility with f m bank trust company f m bank 
under the credit facility  loans and letters of credit are available to the company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of million or the company s borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s producing and non producing oil and gas properties and pipeline and the company s methane project assets 
the credit facility includes certain covenants with which the company is required to comply 
these covenants include leverage  interest coverage  minimum liquidity  and general and administrative coverage ratios 
as of september   the company was out of compliance on the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants under the credit facility prior to the assignment to f m bank 
the company was in compliance with the remaining financial covenants under the credit facility 
the noncompliance occurred primarily as a result of the low commodity prices in the last quarter of and first and second quarters of that are included in the covenant compliance calculations 
the company received a waiver for noncompliance of these covenants for the quarter ended september  as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants 
there can be no assurances that the lender will waive noncompliance of covenants should future instances occur 
on july   the company and f m bank entered into an amendment to the credit facility which increased the borrowing base from million to million  set the interest rate to the greater of prime plus or per annum  eliminated the monthly commitment reduction  and changed the maturity date to january  on february   the company and f m bank entered into an amendment to the credit facility which increased the borrowing base from million to million  increased the maximum line of the company s credit amount from million to million  and extended the term of the facility to january  the next borrowing base review will take place in june the total borrowing by the company under the facility at december  and december  was million and million respectively 
although the company has not been required as of the date of this report to make any payment of principal to f m bank under the borrowing base in effect at any time  the company can make no assurance that in view of the conditions in the national and world economies  including the realistic possibility of low commodity prices being received for the company s oil and gas production for extended periods  that f m may in the future make a redetermination of the company s borrowing base to a point below the level of the installment or other payments to f m in such amount and at such times in order to reduce the principal of the company s outstanding borrowing to a level not in excess of the borrowing base as it may be redetermined 
during and  the company focused on production and carefully used its cash flow and available credit to do so 
however  the company can make no assurance that it can continue normal operations indefinitely or for any specific period of time in the event of extended periods of low commodity prices  such as occurred in late and early  or upon the occurrence of any significant downturn or losses in operations 
in such event  the company may be required to reduce costs of operations by various means  including not undertaking certain maintenance or reworking operations that may be necessary to keep some of the company s properties in production or to seek additional working capital by additional means such as issuance of equity including preferred stock or such other means as may be considered and authorized by the company s board of directors from time to time 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to higher product prices received during as compared to the reduction in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to lower product prices received during as compared to cash flow used for working capital was million in and million in both and net cash used in investing activities was in  million in  and million in the increase in over levels was due to higher levels of drilling and polymer activity during the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction in investment of million in oil and gas properties and million in the methane project from levels 
in  million of cash was used in financing activities related primarily to the company entering into a sweep account arrangement allowing excess cash balances to be used to temporarily pay down the credit facility  thereby  reducing overall interest cost 
in no cash was provided by or used in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the decrease in was due to no new additional borrowings being made by the company under the credit facility 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold to purchasers at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
natural gas meters are placed at the customer s location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the purchasers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  day rate rentals and costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying an average price arithmetic average of the beginning of the month prices for the prior months to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b cost of properties not being amortized  and c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the cost being amortized 
prior to the year ending december   the ceiling limitation was calculated using the year end price 
the change from using the year end price to using the average price was based on adoption of asu  extractive activities oil and gas topic  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures see recent accounting pronouncements below 
oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations relate to the plugging  dismantling and removal of wells drilled to date 
the company follows the requirements of fasb asc  asset retirement obligations and environmental obligations 
among other things  fasb asc requires entities to record a liability and corresponding increase in long lived assets for the present value of material obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
over the passage of time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depleted over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
the company s asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the plugging  dismantling and removal of wells drilled to date 
the company s calculation of asset retirement obligation used a credit adjusted risk free rate of  when the original liability for wells drilled prior to was recognized 
in  the retirement obligations were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
the retirement obligations for new wells drilled in january through july were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
the retirement obligations for new wells drilled after july were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of the company used an estimated useful life of wells ranging from years and an estimated plugging and abandonment cost of  per well in kansas and  per well in tennessee 
management continues to periodically evaluate the appropriateness of these assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act wall street reform act was signed into law 
the wall street reform act permanently exempts small public companies with less than million in market capitalization nonaccelerated filers from the requirement in section b of the sarbanes oxley act of that requires a registrant to provide an attestation report on management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting by the registrant s external auditor 
disclosure of management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting under existing section a is still required for nonaccelerated filers 
in february   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  effective immediately  which amended asc topic  subsequent events 
the amendment was made to address concerns about conflicts with sec guidance and other practice issues 
among the provisions of the amendment  the fasb defined a new type of entity  termed an sec filer  which is an entity required to file with or furnish its financial statements to the sec 
entities other than registrants whose financial statements are included in sec filings eg  businesses or real estate operations acquired or to be acquired  equity method investees  and entities whose securities collateralize registered securities are not sec filers 
while an sec filer is still required by us gaap to evaluate subsequent events through the date its financial statements are issued  it is no longer required to disclose in the financial statements that it has done so or the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the company does not believe the changes have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires more robust disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  this update had no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events  which requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet  including the estimates inherent in the preparation of the financial statements 
the final rules were effective for interim and annual reports issued after june  the company has adopted the policy effective september  there was no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption 
in june  the fasb issued asc  codification which establishes fasb codification as the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
the final rule was effective for interim and annual reports issued after september  the company has adopted the policy effective september  there was no material effect on the presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of asc on december   the sec published the final rules and interpretations updating its oil and gas reporting requirements modernization of oil and gas reporting 
in january  the fasb released asu  extractive activities oil and gas topic  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  aligning us gaap standards with the sec s new rules 
many of the revisions were updates to definitions in the existing oil and gas rules to make them consistent with the petroleum resource management system  which is a widely accepted standard for the management of petroleum resources that was developed by several industry organizations 
key revisions include a changes to the pricing used to estimate reserves utilizing a month average price rather than a single day spot price which eliminates the ability to utilize subsequent prices to the end of a reporting period when the full cost ceiling was exceeded and subsequent pricing exceeds pricing at the end of a reporting period  b the ability to include nontraditional resources in reserves  c the use of new technology for determining reserves  and d permitting disclosure of probable and possible reserves 
the sec requires companies to comply with the amended disclosure requirements for registration statements filed after january   and for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  asu is effective for annual periods ending on or after december  adoption of topic did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued asu  accounting for extractive activities oil gas amendments to paragraph s this asu amends terminology as defined in topic s adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations due by period as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years long term debt obligations see note long term debt operating lease obligations see note commitments and contingencies total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas prices realizations ranged from monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
in order to help mitigate commodity price risk  the company has entered into a long term fixed price contract for mmc gas sales 
on august   the company entered into a five year fixed price gas sales contract with atmos energy marketing  llc  aem in houston  texas  a nonregulated unit of atmos energy corporation nyse ato for the sale of the methane component of landfill gas produced by mmc at the carter valley landfill 
the agreement provides for the sale of up to mmbtu per day 
the contract is effective beginning with september gas production and ends july  the agreed contract price of over per mmbtu was a premium to the then current five year strip price for natural gas on the nymex futures market 
in addition  the company has a remaining derivative agreement on a specified number of barrels of oil that currently constitutes less than half of the company s daily production that ends on july  on july  the company entered into a two year agreement on crude oil pricing applicable to a specified number of barrels of oil that then constituted about two thirds of the company s daily production 
the agreement was effective beginning august  the costless collar agreement has a per barrel floor and per barrel cap on a volume of  barrels per month during the period from august  through december   and  barrels per month from january through july  the prices referenced in this agreement are wti nymex 
while the agreement is based on wti nymex prices  the company receives a price based on kansas common plus bonus  which results in approximately per barrel less than current wti nymex prices 
under a costless collar agreement  no payment would be made or received by the company  as long as the settlement price is between the floor price and cap price within the collar 
however  if the settlement price is above the cap  the company would be required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly volumes hedged 
also  if the settlement price is below the floor  the counterparty would be required to pay the company the deficit of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly volumes hedged 
this agreement is primarily intended to help maintain and stabilize cash flow from operations if lower oil prices return  while providing some upside if prices increase above the cap 
if lower oil prices return  this agreement may help to maintain the company s production levels of crude oil by enabling the company to perform some ongoing polymer or other workover treatments on then existing producing wells in kansas 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million including  as of that date  million owed on its credit facility with f m bank 
the interest rate on the credit facility is variable at a rate equal to the greater of prime rate plus  or per annum 
the company s remaining debt of million has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company annual interest cost in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  during  the company paid million of interest on the f m bank line of credit 
the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in the interest rate on the f m bank credit facility would be approximately million assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of december  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company financial position  results of operations and cash flows
