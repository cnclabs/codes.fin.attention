item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe that coast is one of the largest wholesale suppliers of replacement parts  supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles rvs and boats in north america 
we supply more than  products and serve more than  customers throughout the united states and canada  from regional distribution centers in the united states and regional distribution centers in canada 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers collectively  aftermarket customers 
factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products our sales are affected primarily by the usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom our aftermarket customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and their purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and purchases of new and used rvs and boats by consumer  because they often accessorize their rvs and boats at or shortly after the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers  their confidence about economic conditions and the availability and the costs to them of credit 
as a result  recessionary conditions and a tightening in the availability or increases in the costs of borrowings to consumers often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increases in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
finally  the usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore their need for and purchases of the products we sell are affected by weather conditions 
we experienced significant decreases both in our sales and gross profits in as a result of the economic recession and credit crisis which adversely affected consumer confidence and led to reductions in discretionary income and spending  and reduced the availability of credit which many consumers rely on to finance the purchase and the costs of using rvs and boats 
in  we experienced a modest increases in sales and gross profits  as compared to  which we believe were due primarily to a stabilizing of the economy  an improving albeit cautionary economic outlook  some easing of consumer credit 
however  we continue to see fluctuations  rather than sustained growth  in consumer demand and  due primarily to continued uncertainties about the strength of the economic recovery  and recent increases in the prices of gasoline which can adversely affect the willingness of consumers to use and purchase rvs and boats  we expect conditions in the rv and boating markets to remain unstable and difficult  until there is a more sustained economic recovery  employment levels begin steadily increasing and the availability and cost of consumer credit improve 

table of contents overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides information comparing our results of operations in the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operation in fiscal and fiscal dollars are in thousands  except per share data

the economic recession and credit crisis  which began in the latter part of and worsened in and  continued to adversely affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending in nevertheless  as the above table indicates and as discussed below  we were able to increase our sales and reduce our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses and interest expense  which enabled us to increase both our pre tax earnings and net earnings in the year ended december   as compared to increase in sales 
we were able to achieve a million  or  increase in our sales in to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of i a firming in the demand for the products we sell in the first half of  as our after market customers replenished their inventories in anticipation of the customary increases in usage and purchases of rvs and boats in the spring and summer months  and ii an increase in sales of air conditioners during the last half of as a result of a gain in the share of the rv air conditioner after market that was primarily attributable to the withdrawal from the market of a manufacturer that had supplied air conditioners to some of the rv parts and accessories distributors with which we compete 
reduction in sg a expenses 
due to cost saving measures which we began implementing in late in response to the onset of the economic recessions and credit crisis and which we continued in and  we reduced our sg a expenses by  in as compared to that reduction  coupled with the increase in net sales  enabled us to increase operating income by approximately  in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense declined by  or  to  in  from  in  primarily as a result of i a reduction in average bank borrowings outstanding during  made possible primarily by reductions in average inventories and accounts receivable  and ii lower market rates of interest in which determine the rate of interest charged on our bank borrowings 
increases in pre tax and net earnings 
due primarily to the combined effects of the increase in net sales and the reductions in sg a expenses and interest expense in i pre tax earnings increased by  or  to  from  in  and ii net earnings increased by  or  to  or per diluted share  from  or per diluted share  in  as an increase in income tax expense of  or  substantially reduced the bottom line impact of the increase in pre tax earnings in 
table of contents outlook for continuing uncertainties and concerns among businesses and consumers regarding the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery and persistent high rates of unemployment have continued into we expect these conditions will continue to adversely affect purchases and the usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore  also the purchases  both by consumers and our aftermarket customers  of the products that we sell during as a result  our strategic goals for are to capture additional market share and to improve our gross margin  primarily by increasing our sales of higher margin proprietary products and other foreign sourced products and taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our costs of sales 
for example  during the latter part of  we succeeded in renegotiating some of our warehouse leases and  as a result  we expect warehouse rents to decline 
in addition  in response to this difficult economic climate  we are continuing to monitor and look for additional measures to reduce our sg a expenses 
as a result  we believe that we can achieve a modest improvement in our operating results in  as compared to  assuming that economic and market conditions in the united states and canada stabilize and the availability of credit to businesses and consumers increases 
on the other hand  if these conditions do not improve meaningfully in  it may become necessary for us to implement additional cost cutting measures 
due to the risks in the economy and in our business and the uncertainties that exist regarding future economic and market conditions  it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy whether we will succeed in achieving our goals for see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for a discussion of some of those risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including the assumptions and judgments we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance 
however  those assumptions and judgments are necessarily based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the prospects for realizing the values at which we had recorded these assets  pursuant to gaap we may be required to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves  an allowance for inventory obsolescence and a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to the extent necessary to reduce its carrying value to the amount of that asset that we believe we are likely to be able to use to reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
the amounts at which those allowances or reserves are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
we periodically increase or replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our allowances or reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic downturns  will be of 
table of contents short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  we make such estimates based upon the information available to us at that time and reevaluate and adjust the reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are included in revenue and our shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product for return 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we sometimes grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts receivable in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events or circumstances that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of customers to make payments to us on a timely basis  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory and reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
we are a wholesale distributor and not a manufacturer of products and  therefore  all of our inventory consists of finished goods 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines and estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and trends 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary for us to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which we operate  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were  or approximately of total inventories  at december   as compared to  or approximately of total inventories  at december  
table of contents deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce the amounts of our income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely  than not  that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us that it is more likely  than not  that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in their entirety prior to their expiration  then we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount that we believe we will be able to utilize 
that reduction would be implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that would be recorded in our statement of operations 
at december   the aggregate amount of our net deferred tax asset was approximately million  as compared to million at december  long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our canadian and other foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation as an expense in the calculation of net income loss 
the company recognizes stock compensation expense in the period in which the employee is required to provide service  which is generally over the vesting period of the individual equity instruments 
stock options issued in lieu of cash to non employees for services performed are recorded at the fair value of the options at the time they are issued and are expensed as service is provided 
stock based compensation expense in the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
warranty costs 
we generally do not independently warrant the products that we distribute 
instead  in almost all cases  the manufacturers of the products that we distribute warrant the products and allow us to return defective products  including those that have been returned to us by our customers 
however  we sell a line of portable and standby generators under a product supply arrangement which obligates us to provide warranty services for these products and to share the costs of providing those services with the manufacturer 
the duration of the warranty period for these products is months following the sale of the product to a retail customer 
we established warranty reserves for these products of  and  at december  and  respectively 
those amounts were determined on the basis of a number of factors  including our estimates of future sales of the products that we warrant and our historical and expected future warranty claims experience 
in the event changes occur in the conditions or circumstances upon which those assumptions and estimates were made  it could become necessary for us to increase the reserve by means of a charge to our income 
recent accounting pronouncements with the exception of those discussed below  there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended december   that we believe are of significance  or potential significance to the company based upon current operations 
in october  the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times 
specifically  
table of contents this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists 
the new rules are effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  we adopted the applicable sections of the fasb s guidance on earnings per share that addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
that guidance indicates that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of basic earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
the adoption of these applicable sections did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued new guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  as well as requiring the presentation  on a gross basis  of information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in level fair value measurements 
this guidance also clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation  inputs and valuation techniques 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and became effective for the company on january  disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and became effective for the company on march  the adoption of this new accounting guidance impacts only disclosure requirements and did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued an update to subsequent events 
this guidance amends the previous definition of an sec filer and removed the requirement that an sec filer disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
the update also requires sec filers to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued rather than the date the financial statements are available to be issued 
the company adopted this guidance upon issuance with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued an update to stock based compensation  which clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity shares trade should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market performance or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if the award otherwise qualifies as equity 
the standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  derived from our statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses operating income loss interest expense earnings loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss net sales net sales consist of revenues from the sales of the products we supply or distribute  net of an allowance for product returns 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the changes in our net sales in fiscal and  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding year 
dollars in the table are in thousands 

table of contents change vs 
change vs 
vs 
the increase in net sales in as compared to was due to a modest firming  in the first half of the year  in the demand for the products that we sell  as our customers replenished product inventories  and in the second half of the year  to an increase in sales of air conditioners that are installed on rvs 
that increase in our share of the rv air conditioner after market was primarily attributable to an unexpected withdrawal  from the rv market  of a manufacturer that had supplied air conditioners to some of the rv aftermarket distributors with which we compete  which led some of their after market customers to order air conditioners from us 
vs 
the decrease in sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to declines in purchases and in the usage of rvs and boats 
those declines were primarily attributable to the worsening of the economic recession  further increases in unemployment  and a decline in the availability of consumer and business credit in the united states and canada during  which adversely affected confidence  both of consumers and our after market  about future economic conditions and discretionary spending by them 
gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the costs of sales from net sales 
costs of sales consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  inbound freight charges  merchandise receiving  handling and storage costs  and out bound freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin vs 
although gross profits increased modestly in  as compared to  our gross margin declined to in from in this decline was due to a combination of factors  consisting primarily of i a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of lower margin items  ii selected price reductions that we implemented in response to increased price competition in our markets  iii an increase in freight in costs 
vs 
due to the decrease in our net sales in  gross profits declined by nearly million  or  in as compared to notwithstanding that decline  our gross margin improved to in from in  due to a combination of factors  including i a reduction in shipping costs due to decreases in the price of fuel  ii a reduction in cash discounts and rebates offered to our customers  iii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced from asia  v reductions in warehouse labor and other distribution costs due primarily a full year s effect of the cost savings measures that we began implementing in late  which included reductions in the number of and in the wages paid to warehouse personnel  and vi a strengthening of the canadian dollar during the second half of  which enabled our canadian subsidiary  which purchases products from suppliers in the united states  to improve its margins during that period 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  and administrative labor and other administrative expenses  professional fees  insurance and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
dollars in thousands sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales and in  we reduced our sg a expenses  in absolute dollars  by million  as compared to  and by an additional  in  as compared to these reductions in sg a expenses were attributable to cost cutting measures that we began implementing in the latter part of  including i workforce 
table of contents reductions  ii reductions in management salaries and employee wages  and iii reductions in selling and marketing and other administrative expenses  in response to the onset of the economic recession and the credit crisis 
in  we continued those cost savings measures and implemented others  including further reductions in salaries and wages 
we continued those cost savings measures throughout  with the exception of the salary and wage reductions 
effective july  we restored  on a prospective basis  one half of the salary and wage cuts that we implemented in and in  in response to improving economic conditions and increases in our sales and operating income 
the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income loss dollars in thousands operating income loss as a percentage of net sales vs 
the  or  increase in operating income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of the increase in net sales and the reduction in sg a expenses in vs 
we generated operating income of million in  an improvement of million from the loss from operations of million incurred in that improvement was the result of the increase in gross margin and the reduction in sg a expenses  which more than offset the effects on our operating results of the decrease in net sales in other expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other expense interest expense other expense total the largest component of other expense is the interest expense that we incur on borrowings 
the other component of other expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains or losses and gains or losses on disposal of assets 
vs 
interest expense decreased in by  or  in  as compared to  due primarily to a reduction in our average outstanding credit line borrowings and a decrease in the average rate of interest charged on those borrowings 
that reduction in credit line borrowings was made possible by a modest reduction in average inventories primarily as a result of efficiencies realized in our distribution and warehouse operations and a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to our continued application of the stringent credit standards adopted in the decrease in the average rate of interest charged on our credit line borrowings was due to declines in market rates of interest which determine the interest rates charged by the bank on those borrowings 
vs 
interest expense decreased by  or  in  as compared to  due primarily to reductions in our average outstanding credit line borrowings and decreases in the average rate of interest charged on those borrowings 
we were able to reduce our average outstanding borrowings in primarily as a result of i reductions in inventories due to the decline in net sales in  as compared to  and efficiencies we achieved in our warehouse and distribution operations  and ii decreases in accounts receivable due to the decline in net sales and our implementation of more stringent credit standards in response to the economic recession 
the decrease in the average rate of interest charged on our credit line borrowings was due to declines in market rates of interest in 
table of contents income tax provision benefit year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected primarily by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  including stock based compensation expense  and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries  because tax rates in their respective countries vary  sometimes considerably  from income tax rates in the united states 
in addition  in years when our income or loss is marginal  such as in and  state franchise and other taxes can lead to increases in our overall tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds 
see sources and uses of cash below 
as previously reported  effective november   we entered into a seventh amendment to the bank line of credit agreement the seventh amendment 
among other things  that amendment extended by three years the maturity date of the credit line to july   ii reduced the rates at which we pay interest on our borrowings  iii modified the formula for determining the maximum borrowings that may be outstanding at any one time during the period from february through may of each year from to of eligible accounts receivable and from to of eligible inventory  but in no event more than  interest on our borrowings under the revolving line of credit is payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at our option but subject to certain limitations  at libor plus per annum 
the amended revolving bank line of credit agreement contains only one financial covenant that we are required to meet  which is a quarterly fixed charge covenant 
that covenant requires us to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to for rolling month periods ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
at december  we were  and we expect that at march  we will be  in compliance with the quarterly fixed charge covenant 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness that the company may incur 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with  day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  we sometimes provide our most creditworthy customers with payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
sources and uses of cash we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
cash used in operations in and during  we used cash of million for our operations  which was comprised of a million increase in inventory and a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by cash provided by operations  consisting of a million increase in accounts payable and million increase in accrued liabilities  net earnings of million  million in depreciation and amortization and in stock based compensation expense 
by comparison  in  our operations provided net cash of million  due primarily to reductions in inventory and accounts receivable of million and million due primarily to the decline in net sales and measures taken to reduce inventories and  thereby reduce interest expense  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and income tax refunds 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities in and during  our financing activities provided us with million of cash principally the result of net borrowings of long term debt under our revolving bank line of credit 
in  we used net cash of million in financing activities  primarily to reduce outstanding bank borrowings  made possible by reductions in inventories and accountants receivable 
cash flows used in investing activities in and in  we used million of cash in investing activities in  principally to fund capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  office  and computer equipment 
in  we used cash of million in investing activities  primarily to fund the purchase of other assets and for capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  testing and design  and computer equipment 
contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately million 
the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments in thousands of dollars  as of december  year ending december  thereafter total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  maturities of contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations less than one year more than one and less than four years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations totals consists of borrowings under our bank credit facility  which matures in july our long term debt obligations consist primarily of borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit facility 
it is not possible to calculate future estimated interest payments on those borrowing predictably  because the amounts of such borrowings fluctuate throughout the year depending on our liquidity needs  which can vary widely primarily due to the seasonality of our business and the effects of prevailing economic conditions on the demand for and the purchases of our products by customers 
also  the interest rate on those borrowings is determined by reference to the bank s prime rate or libor  which also can and often do fluctuate during the year 
additionally  the formulas for determining the specific interest rate that will apply to such borrowings can change from year to year 
set forth above  under the caption financial condition  liquidity and capital resources are the formulas for determining the interest rates that will apply to those borrowings during the fiscal year ending december  dividend policy and dividend payments 
in  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders 
in we paid total cash dividends of  in november  our board of directors suspended the payment of cash dividends in order to preserve cash for operations in response to the worsening of the economic recession and the tightening of credit by banks and other lending institutions to businesses  as well as consumers 
in addition  our bank credit line agreement contains restrictions on our payment of cash dividends 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future 

table of contents expected uses and sources of funds we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range from  to  we expect that these expenditures will be of a recurring nature  for such purposes as the replacement and upgrading of warehouse  computer or office equipment in the ordinary course of our business 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures and our working capital requirements with borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds  assuming that there is not a further worsening of the economic recession in see item a of part i of this report above  entitled risk factors our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in part i of this report 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins by  among other things  establishing new product supply relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in asia  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 
there is no assurance  however  that  if required  we will be able to obtain bank borrowings for these purposes 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
we generate significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august  when usage of rvs and boats are at their peak  than we do during the remainder of the year when weather conditions are not optimal for outdoor activities 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we may incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when our sales are lower 
the following tables presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit of million 
we have substantial sales operations in canada and as a result  our earnings  cash flows and financial position can be affected by movements in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
consequently  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
therefore  from time to time  we may hedge the net investment of our foreign operations in canada by purchasing foreign exchange derivatives  such as purchased put option contracts  to mitigate the risk of changes in value of our net investment in our canadian subsidiary that can occur as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we held no foreign currency derivatives 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
