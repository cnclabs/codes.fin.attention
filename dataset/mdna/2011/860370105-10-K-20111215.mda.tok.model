for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item personalization 
our market research indicates that consumer preferences are shifting towards more personalized memorial services and merchandise for traditional burials as well as cremations 
in response to these changing preferences  we trained our funeral arrangers and sales counselors company wide to be more proficient in 
table of contents their ability to offer our customers a broad range of options  stressing our ability to design a personalized service that reflects the special interests and accomplishments of the deceased 
we also changed the way our product offerings are displayed at our locations  making it easier for our customers to appreciate the many options available to them 
we implemented this custom funeral planning program in all of our funeral homes and refresh the process periodically in order to keep our professionals up to date on our wider selection of merchandise and services 
we hope through this program to provide greater value to our families  leading to higher revenue per event and improved customer satisfaction 
enhanced cremation offerings 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremation 
in fiscal years  and  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our operations were cremations 
according to industry estimates  percent of funeral services in the united states during resulted in cremations  and cremations are expected to represent percent of funeral services in the united states by the year all of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services 
while the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of a traditional full service funeral  we have found that these revenues can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on customization 
for example  in addition to a personalized memorial service to celebrate the life of the deceased  an enhanced cremation may include a casket  an urn and a niche in a mausoleum or columbarium in which to place the remains 
we continue to market our products and services to address the rising demand for cremations 
in late fiscal year  we hired a vice president of cremation and in early fiscal year  we hired a senior vice president of cremation  both with extensive industry and cremation experience  to support our current operations and sales teams in growing cremation revenue and profits 
during fiscal year  we began a program of improving our cremation property and merchandise product offerings 
we are planning to develop cremation gardens and other cremation projects in our cemeteries over the next few years 
we have completed nine cremation gardens and other cremation memorialization projects  and we currently have projects under construction with more than additional projects under feasibility review 
we completed a number of these projects in fiscal year and spent approximately million 
this spending represents a shift from traditional cemetery inventory spending to cremation inventory spending 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million on cremation inventory development 
we intend to continue to improve our ability to satisfy the needs of those interested in cremation 
in fiscal year  our average revenue per cremation service increased percent compared to fiscal year we have alternative service firms  generally located on the west coast  that serve primarily cremation customers 
these firms are generally located in leased premises and have lower overhead than traditional funeral homes 
these firms primarily offer direct cremations with limited additional products and services 
although death care arrangements at these locations are typically less expensive than services at a traditional funeral home  it is not our goal to be the low price leader in these markets 
e commerce 
during fiscal year  we began using the internet to create new sales channels and new consumer relationships  and are continuing to invest in this initiative 
while we did not earn significant revenue from this activity in  we anticipate that our revenue will improve in the future 
during fiscal year  we continued to improve the internet websites of our funeral home locations 
many people access our websites to obtain information about services for a deceased relative or friend  and often read an obituary or sign a guest book 
we have added to our websites products and services that can be purchased to support the family of the deceased  including making personal photobooks  and creating permanent online memorials  as well as providing unique  meaningful gifts during and after the grieving period 
visitors to the websites can also make travel arrangements online and buy books on grief management and related topics 
management 
we have an experienced management team 
many of our regional managers owned and operated their own funeral homes and cemeteries and joined us when we acquired their business 
in addition  we have a senior management team with experience both in the industry and outside of the industry  which we believe allows us to introduce innovations effectively and improve the efficiencies of our existing businesses 
centralized support services 
our shared services center  which we opened in  was developed for the standardization and centralization of many of our facilities administrative and support processes such as accounting  
table of contents management reporting  payroll  trust administration  contract processing  accounts payable processing  accounts receivable collection and other services 
it allows us to decrease our costs without diminishing service by creating significant savings on items such as trust administration fees  travel expenses  office supplies  overnight delivery and long distance telephone services 
continuous improvement 
we have taken steps over the last few years to improve our purchasing and processing efficiencies 
over the last several years  we have worked to align our geographic regions to better integrate our operations and sales activities 
in  we instituted a companywide centralized purchasing department to leverage our size and negotiate more favorable supplier and vendor contracts 
during  we implemented a new companywide financial software system and in a new payroll system 
we implemented a companywide image scanning system and a new contract processing industry specific software system that serves as a platform for a new point of sale system currently being developed 
also  over the last two years  we implemented a new vendor invoice processing system that has streamlined the way we route  code and approve invoices for payment 
during  we established a continuous improvement department to work solely on these efforts 
we expect that these new systems and processes will improve productivity over time  and  as we look at our opportunities for growth  we expect to leverage the efficiencies that we have achieved 
financial information about industry and geographic segments 
for financial information about our industry segments for fiscal years  and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item business strategy our business strategy aims to improve our revenues  profitability and cash flow by implementing our long term strategic plan  which has four components our best in class initiative  our new invention initiative  our manage for cash  invest for growth initiative and our continuous improvement initiative 
improve rooftop performance through our best in class initiative 
during fiscal year  we completed the initial implementation of the best in class component of our strategic plan 
the initiative is designed to improve the performance of all of our rooftop locations  by repositioning us from more decentralized practices to more standardized best in class practices 
we have given all managers the same key metrics by which they can measure their performance  and have provided tools to facilitate the sharing of best practices by key metrics across the organization 
for example  key metrics include the number of funeral calls and amount of preneed sales 
if funeral calls or preneed sales are below expectations at a particular location  our program provides suggestions taken from our best performing locations that the manager can use to help grow funeral calls and preneed sales 
we are also looking at locations that are not producing acceptable levels of profitability to determine if changes can be made to achieve best in class results or if divestiture is a more prudent option 
the ultimate goal is organic growth and increased profitability 
additionally through our best in class initiative  we are focused intently on improving our revenues from cremation customers 
we have hired new management devoted solely to this effort and intend to continue to devote significant resources to it 
for additional information  see operations enhanced cremation offerings 
we are also working to expand our third party affiliations 
for additional information  see operations third party affiliations 
introduce new related revenue sources through our new invention initiative 
the new invention component of our strategic plan seeks to generate new tangential growth opportunities not tied to the growth of our base business 
an example of our progress with this initiative is our investment  along with other industry participants  in an internet start up company called tributes 
com 
tributes 
com offers consumers a means to create meaningful and lasting remembrances that either complement or substitute for traditional newspaper obituary notices 
previously  our locations incurred labor costs for preparing obituary notices  but did not receive any compensation from the publications that receive a fee for publishing the notice 
tributes 
com is intended to allow us to capture market share in the existing obituary notice revenue stream in each of the communities in which we operate  and to increase that revenue stream by offering additional and or permanent memorialization options 
while tributes 
com is still a start up company  we believe it will have significant benefits to our company  the industry and the families we serve 
additionally  we have begun using the websites of our businesses to create new sales channels

table of contents manage for cash  invest for growth 
this includes strengthening our balance sheet  supporting our base businesses  growing through prudent acquisitions  supporting new invention and deploying cash flow to improve shareholder returns 
the acquisition component of our strategic plan is to acquire businesses and implement our best in class practices in them 
we will evaluate acquisition opportunities that make sense for our business strategy at prices we believe will result in satisfactory returns to our shareholders 
during fiscal year  we completed million of acquisitions 
during the last five fiscal years  we have generated more than million each year in cash flow from operations 
as an indication of our board s confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and ability to continue to generate cash flow  our board increased our annual cash dividend by percent to 
per share in june twice during fiscal year  our board increased the availability under our current stock repurchase program  for a total increase of million 
we repurchased million shares of our stock under our stock repurchase program for approximately million during fiscal year also in fiscal year  we completed the acquisitions of two funeral cemetery combinations  completed the construction of one additional stand alone funeral home and one funeral home that is part of a combination operation and purchased a funeral home building that we previously leased 
during fiscal years and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  principal amount of our outstanding senior convertible notes at a significant discount to their par value 
since the inception of the debt repurchase program in fiscal year  we have repurchased million of our senior convertible notes at million less than face value and have produced million of annual cash interest savings 
we will continue to evaluate the use of our cash to pay dividends  repurchase debt and stock  invest in our strategic initiatives  construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or in strategic locations and make acquisitions of  or investments in  death care or related business  with a view towards choosing the best opportunities to enhance long term shareholder value 
increase efficiencies and profits through our continuous improvement initiative 
this effort aims to eliminate waste and inefficiency  produce more timely and accurate information for management  and improve productivity over time 
this includes embracing technology  standardized training  and cost reduction initiatives 
our corporate general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were the lowest in the last five fiscal years 
the death care industry industry consolidation 
death care businesses in the united states have traditionally been relatively small  family owned enterprises that have passed through successive generations within the family 
the decade of the s witnessed a trend of family owned firms consolidating with larger organizations  but this trend slowed dramatically in as the number of consolidators participating in the acquisition market declined  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursuing transactions at lower prices 
our industry continues to be characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations  with approximately percent of industry revenue being generated by independently owned operations 
we estimate that our industry  which consists of approximately  funeral homes and  cemeteries in the united states  collectively generates approximately billion in annual revenue 
large public death care companies have also experienced consolidation 
equity corporation international  previously the fourth largest public death care company  merged with service corporation international sci in also in  the loewen group  inc  at the time the second largest death care company  entered into bankruptcy proceedings 
loewen emerged from bankruptcy as alderwoods group  inc in and was subsequently acquired by sci in november in march  sci acquired keystone north america  inc  the fifth largest death care company in north america 
during the s  we grew rapidly primarily through acquisitions of funeral homes and cemeteries both domestically and abroad  financed by new equity and debt 
we ceased our acquisition activity in and developed strategies for improving our cash flow and reducing restructuring debt 
during fiscal years through  we completed our transitional strategies of improving our cash flow  restructuring and reducing our debt and 
table of contents selling our foreign assets 
during fiscal years through  we sold underperforming assets  refinanced and further reduced our debt and implemented new strategies to improve operations 
during fiscal years through we focused on our new long term strategic plan and on implementing new business systems to further improve operations 
we believe  at the appropriate pricing  that growing our organization through acquisitions remains a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
importance of tradition  barriers to entry 
we believe it is difficult for new competitors to enter existing markets successfully by opening new cemeteries 
the barriers to entry are lower in the funeral business 
entry into the cemetery market can be difficult due to several factors 
because families tend to return to the same cemetery for multiple generations to bury family members  it is difficult for new cemeteries to attract families 
additionally  mature markets  including many of the metropolitan areas where our cemeteries are located  are often served by an adequate number of existing cemeteries with sufficient land for additional plots  whereas land for new cemetery development is often scarce and expensive 
regulatory complexities and zoning restrictions also make entry into the cemetery market difficult 
finally  development of a new cemetery usually requires a significant capital investment that takes several years to produce a return 
continuing need for products and services  increasing number of deaths 
there is an inevitable need for our products and services 
although the number of deaths in the united states will reflect short term fluctuations  deaths in the united states are expected to increase at a steady  moderate pace over the long term 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in furthermore  the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in we believe the aging of the population is particularly important because it expands our target market for preneed sales  as persons over the age of are the most likely group to make preneed funeral and cemetery arrangements 
growing demand for cremation 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremations 
the trend toward cremations has historically been a significant concern for traditional funeral home and cemetery operators because cremations have typically included few  if any  additional products or services other than the cremation itself 
we are  however  focused intently on improving our revenues from cremations 
we have hired new management devoted solely to this effort and intend to continue to devote significant resources to it 
for additional information  including information about our strategies to address this trend  see operations enhanced cremation offerings above 
competition our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral home and cemetery firms 
we also compete with monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and crematories  and other non traditional providers of services or products 
discount retailers have begun marketing caskets at prices that are sometimes substantially lower than what we offer 
consumers can also now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
market share for funeral services and cemetery property is largely a function of goodwill  family heritage and tradition  although competitive pricing  professional service and attractive  well maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important 
market share for funeral and cemetery merchandise is largely a function of price 
extensive marketing through media advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased in recent years  especially with respect to the sale of preneed funeral services 
regulation our funeral home operations are regulated by the federal trade commission the ftc under the ftc s trade regulation rule on funeral industry practices  cfr part the funeral rule  which went into effect on april   and was revised effective july  the funeral rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices 
the preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate  itemized price information and various other disclosures 
table of contents about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from misrepresenting legal  crematory and cemetery requirements  embalming for a fee without permission  requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation  and requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services 
on march   representative bobby l 
rush d 
ill 
and eleven co sponsors introduced hr  the bereaved consumers bill of rights of to direct the ftc to draft regulations to extend the funeral rule to cemeteries  crematories and sellers of caskets and other funeral merchandise and to require certain disclosures with respect to preneed sales of funeral services or funeral goods 
the bill was referred to the subcommittee on commerce  manufacturing and trade on march  and no further action has been taken 
we cannot predict the effect this legislation might have on us if passed 
our operations are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
for example  state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral homes and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
our embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
we have a department that monitors compliance  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the funeral rule and all such laws and regulations 
federal  state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations  some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general 
we cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  persons including approximately  full time employees  and we believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining units

risk factors cautionary statements our business is subject to significant risks 
we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements in this report and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business our earnings from our trusts can be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates  which can have a significant adverse effect on our gross profit  net earnings and cash flows 
because of our preneed sales activities and the related state trusting requirements that accompany preneed sales  our business is impacted by changes in financial markets 
we maintain three types of trusts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services together with the preneed funeral merchandise and services trusts  preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care 
our trust assets are generally invested in a mix of equity and fixed income securities  and dividend and interest rates and investment gains and 
table of contents losses are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
generally  declines in market performance reduce the earnings in our trusts and reduce our earnings and cash flow 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise in the future and result in there being less funds available to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by operating cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiary  iti  earns trust management fees based on the fair market value of the trusts managed  therefore  declines in the fair market value of the assets in the trusts decrease the amount of fees we collect and earn for trust management 
in fiscal years    and cemetery perpetual care trust earnings  preneed trust earnings and iti trust management fees comprised percent  percent  percent  percent and percent of our revenue  respectively  and percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  of our gross profit  respectively  for each of those years 
during fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  we experienced significant declines in the market value of our trust portfolio  consistent with overall market declines during that time period 
during fiscal years and  our preneed trusts experienced a total return of percent and percent  respectively  and our cemetery perpetual care trusts experienced a total return of percent and percent  respectively 
however  these improved returns did not restore all of the market value lost during fiscal year and early on october   unrealized losses in our trust portfolio were million  and on october   unrealized losses amounted to million 
declines in our perpetual care trust earnings and in revenue for fees we earn for managing our trusts impact current revenue  while realized earnings and losses on preneed trust investments are allocated to the underlying contracts and recognized as revenue when the underlying products or services are delivered 
during fiscal years   and  we recognized million  million  million and million in revenue from trust related activities 
by comparison  in fiscal year  we recognized million from trust related activities 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded impairment charges in our trusts that will impact our revenues and gross profit in future years 
given that the contracts in our preneed trusts have historically had an average term of approximately years  we project that impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year could decrease our revenue and gross profit for the foreseeable future by approximately million to million per year 
if market conditions further deteriorate or we experience additional realized losses  trust related revenue would decrease  and the decrease could be material 
we believe that our trust investments will appreciate in value over the long term 
however  whether they will appreciate and over what time period cannot be predicted with any certainty 
additional information regarding our trusts and related risks are described in the risk factors that follow 
earnings in preneed trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower future revenues  earnings and cash flows 
declines in earnings in our preneed trusts can cause a decline in our reported future revenues  earnings and cash flows 
with respect to these trusts  we defer recognition and generally withdrawal of dividends  interest income and realized gains until the underlying product or service is delivered 
realized gains and losses generally have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  except to the extent there are tax consequences as described later in these risk factors 
dividends  interest income and realized gains and losses are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of future revenue recognized  and cash withdrawn  at the time the specific contract is performed 
in our preneed trusts  at october   the fair market value of the investments in the trusts of million was million lower than our cost basis of million 
in most of our trusts  unrealized gains and losses are not allocated to individual contracts  in accordance with our trust agreements  however  as gains and losses are realized  they are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of earnings we recognize and cash we withdraw at the time the contracts are ultimately performed 
thus  significant unrealized losses in these trusts  if they do not recover over time  can limit future earnings available to us 
although we have significant unrealized and unallocated losses in our trust portfolio  as of october   we also had million in earnings that have been realized and allocated to contracts that we will recognize in the future when the underlying contracts are performed 
for fiscal years through  funeral trust earnings included in our reported revenue amounted to million  million  million  million and million  respectively  and cemetery merchandise and service trust earnings amounted to million  million  million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents if the fair market value of these trusts were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contract 
no such charge has ever been recorded 
for additional information  see note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item realized capital losses in preneed trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have insufficient offsetting gains  can cause increases in our current period effective tax rate and a reduction of our current period reported net earnings and a reduction in operating cash flows in future periods 
approximately percent of the october  fair market value of our preneed trusts are trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
for fiscal years through  the trusts for which we are the grantor incurred net gains losses subject to valuation allowance analysis of million  million  million and million  respectively 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have insufficient offsetting gains  may require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
during fiscal year  we recorded a tax valuation allowance of million related to capital losses realized in our preneed trusts for which we are the grantor for tax purposes 
we recorded an additional million tax valuation allowance in fiscal year and were able to subsequently reduce this allowance by million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future to offset the capital loss during the carry forward period which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will pay higher taxes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all earnings in grantor trusts are ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
as of october   we have approximately million remaining in unrealized losses for tax purposes in trusts for which we are the grantor  hypothetically  if all of these losses were realized at once  this would have resulted in an additional valuation allowance of approximately million  assuming a projected tax rate of percent 
we currently have only a limited amount of embedded gains in our trusts 
also  we have utilized all previous capital gains recorded in tax year and prior tax years to offset prior capital losses 
accordingly  if we experience additional realized losses in these trusts and do not have or expect to have future capital gains available within or outside the trusts to offset these losses  we would record an additional valuation allowance and related reduction of net income 
earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower current and potentially future revenues  earnings and cash flows 
in addition  we may be required to fund realized net capital losses in these trusts  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flow 
pursuant to cemetery perpetual care contracts and laws  a portion  generally percent to percent  of the proceeds from cemetery property sales is deposited into perpetual care trusts 
the income from these trusts  which have been established in most jurisdictions in which we operate cemeteries  is used for maintenance of those cemeteries  but principal must generally be held by the trust in perpetuity 
the statutory provisions that create and regulate these trusts differ from state to state  as do the regulatory interpretations of the provisions 
the trusts are reviewed regularly by the respective state regulatory authorities 
we currently recognize all dividend and interest income earned and  in states where it is permitted  realized net capital gains generated by cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the cash withdrawn is used to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
therefore  declines in these eligible distributable earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts would cause a decline in current earnings and cash flows 
likewise  sustained declines in these earnings would 
table of contents reduce future revenues and cash flows and would require cash flow from other sources to continue to maintain our cemeteries at the same level 
for fiscal years through  earnings in these trusts contributed million  million  million  million and million  respectively  to cemetery revenue 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  at october   the fair market value of our investments of million was million lower than our cost basis of million 
if we realize losses in our cemetery perpetual care trusts and the fair market value of the trust assets is less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  some states may require us to make cash deposits to the trust to cover the net realized loss or may require us to stop withdrawing earnings until future earnings cover the net realized loss 
in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past  regulators may seek replenishment of the realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they cover the loss 
as of october   million was recorded for the estimated probable funding obligation 
we are currently utilizing some of the amounts that could be withdrawn from the trusts to satisfy our funding obligation resulting from previously realized capital losses 
as of october   we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states that could be subject to a future funding obligation 
because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  due to the different laws and our trust agreements in those states  we do not believe that we will be required to replenish the realized net capital loss  and have not recorded a funding obligation  however  it is possible that regulators may disagree with our conclusion  and future funding obligations may exist 
as of october   the realized net capital loss in these trusts was million  and the unrealized loss was million 
our distributions from cemetery perpetual care trusts include net realized capital gains on investment sales in states where permitted 
if regulations in these states are changed to no longer permit withdrawal of realized capital gains  our cemetery perpetual care trust eligible distributable earnings may be reduced in the future  which would reduce our earnings and cash flows 
in states where permitted  we withdraw and recognize as revenue net realized capital gains on investment sales in cemetery perpetual care trusts 
currently  our portfolio mix in these states is more heavily weighted to investments that potentially generate capital gains  such as equities 
in states where we do not withdraw capital gains  our portfolio mix is more heavily weighted to fixed income type securities 
if states where capital gains are currently permitted to be withdrawn make changes in legislation or regulations to not allow capital gains to be withdrawn  our future revenues and cash flow may be reduced from historical levels until we are able to replace some or all of the investments that potentially generate capital gains with ones that generate more ordinary income such as fixed income securities 
given current economic conditions and market values  we may not be able to make that shift quickly without triggering capital losses that could require additional funding obligations 
reduced market values of preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts will also reduce our trust management fees 
the fees that our subsidiary  iti  earns for managing the trusts are based on the fair market value of the trusts as determined by quoted market prices 
thus as market values decline  the earnings iti earns and the cash we withdraw for managing the trusts is also reduced 
to the extent market values do not improve  we will earn less in iti fees than we have historically earned 
during fiscal years through  iti trust management fees collected were approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
our trust portfolio has a significant concentration in the financial services sector  which may be more susceptible to additional adverse impact from the current economic environment 
as of october   approximately percent of our preneed trust portfolios and percent of our cemetery perpetual care trust portfolios are invested in issuer specific investments in the financial services sector 

table of contents for the issuer specific financial services sector concentration in the preneed trust portfolio  approximately percent was invested in preferred stock  percent in fixed income securities and percent in common stock investments 
unrealized losses in the financial services sector represented percent of the total unrealized losses of million in our preneed trust portfolio 
for the issuer specific financial services sector concentration in the cemetery perpetual care trust portfolio  approximately percent was invested in preferred stock  percent in fixed income securities and percent in common stock investments 
unrealized losses in the financial services sector represented percent of the total unrealized losses of million in our cemetery perpetual care trust portfolios 
the current economic environment may result in greater declines to the fair market value of our investments in this and other sectors as compared to the performance of our overall trust portfolio and or market benchmarks  including the s p index 
each sector has particular risks associated with it  and depending on our asset allocation  sector mix  company specific information and future economic events  our portfolio could be at risk for further decline 
for additional information  see the section titled preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item a reduction in federal tax rates could result in a significant non cash charge to earnings 
as of october   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets 
if federal tax rates are reduced by congress  we could incur a significant non cash charge to earnings 
a weakened economy could decrease preneed sales 
a reduction in discretionary spending could also decrease amounts at need customers are willing to pay  and could cause third party insurance providers that fund our insurance funded preneed funeral contracts to experience financial difficulties 
a weakened economy that causes customers to reduce discretionary spending could cause  and we believe has caused  declines in preneed sales  and could also decrease the amounts at need customers are willing to pay 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales and average revenue per at need event would reduce current revenue 
declines in preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales would reduce our backlog and could reduce our future revenues and market share 
a weakened economy could also impact our customers ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  increased bad debt and decreased finance charge revenue which would reduce future earnings and cash flow 
a weakened economy could also increase costs related to sales force turnover and commissions we are unable to recoup as contract cancellation rates increase 
if a contract is cancelled before collecting a specified amount  the related commission is charged back to the sales counselor 
if the sales counselor is no longer employed by us when the contract is cancelled  we are often unable to recoup that commission 
some of the preneed funeral contracts we sell are funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers 
the net amount of these contracts that have not been fulfilled as of october  was million 
these contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  but we include them when we discuss our anticipated backlog or anticipated future revenue from preneed funeral sales 
approximately percent of these contracts have been funded by forethought life insurance company forethought 
if forethought or any other insurance companies that have issued policies to our customers experience financial difficulties  our potential future revenue associated with these contracts  and commissions we would receive from selling these types of contracts in the future  could be at risk 
for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies for insurance funded preneed funeral contracts  see note i to our consolidated financial statements included in item continued economic weakness and financial and stock market declines could reduce future potential earnings and cash flows and could result in future goodwill impairments 
as of october   goodwill amounted to million  consisting of million in the funeral segment and million in the cemetery segment 
our cemetery segment tends to be more sensitive to goodwill impairments because it has a heavier reliance on preneed sales that are impacted by changes in consumer sentiment and customer discretionary income 
if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and 
table of contents increased costs or if the current economic conditions result in additional companies in which the trust portfolio is invested in filing for bankruptcy  we may have a triggering event which could result in further goodwill impairments 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate cash flow 
we have a senior secured revolving credit facility due in  on which no amounts were drawn as of october   and million in fixed rate long term debt becoming due in through we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future  although we will need to refinance the senior secured revolving credit facility and other long term debt as they become due 
our ability to generate cash  to a significant extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in our debt agreements 
our business may not generate cash flow from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured revolving credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms  or at all 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our same store funeral call volumes have not increased for a number of years due to many factors  such as the number of deaths and competition in our markets  our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and various other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
while our same store funeral call volume increased in fiscal year  our same store funeral call volumes decreased for three of the last five years due to many factors described elsewhere in this report  including the number of deaths and intense competition in our markets  and our ability to identify changing consumer preferences 
from fiscal years to  we experienced same store funeral call volume changes of percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to increase same store funeral call volumes over the long term 
declines in same store funeral calls can adversely affect revenues and profits if not offset by increases in average revenue per call or alternative sources of revenue 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products including  in recent years  internet providers 
from time to time  this price competition has caused us to lose market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices  thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and backlog and potentially impact our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
discount retailers sell caskets at prices substantially lower than prices we offer 
consumers can also buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
competition from these sources could reduce our casket sales  which could adversely affect funeral revenues and margins 
increased advertising and better marketing by competitors  as well as increased offering of products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs or to decrease prices in order to retain or recapture market share 

table of contents in recent years  the marketing of preneed funeral services through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs necessary to respond to competition by varying the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on current cash flow and earnings 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services  which are generally paid on an installment basis  are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions and other costs to acquire the sale and the fact that a portion of the sales proceeds is required to be placed into trusts or escrow accounts 
we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow would be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
increased costs  including potential increased health care costs  may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
we may not be successful in maintaining our margins and may incur additional costs 
for example  in the past  we have experienced increased property and casualty insurance costs primarily as a result of hurricanes and natural disasters 
on march   the patient protection and affordable care act became law  and one week later  the health care and education reconciliation act of became effective  together enacting comprehensive health care reform in the united states 
the legislation is likely to increase our health care costs 
many provisions of the law that could impact our business will not become effective until  or later  and require implementation through regulations that have not yet been promulgated 
accordingly  the costs and other effects of the legislation  which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees  cannot be determined with certainty at this time 
we did experience increased healthcare costs in fiscal year we also incurred additional costs in fiscal year in conjunction with improving our business systems and implementing new growth initiatives 
some of the costs impacting our business are largely beyond our control 
to the extent that we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers  they will have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows 
our business is subject to the risk of losses due to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our company is headquartered in the new orleans metropolitan area  and approximately of our funeral homes and of our cemeteries  along with our mausoleum construction and sales business  acme mausoleum  are located near the gulf coast in southern texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama and florida  along the eastern coasts of florida  and north and south carolina and in puerto rico 
these areas are periodically threatened by hurricanes  which can damage our properties  interrupt our business and disrupt the lives of our customers and employees 
we are also at risk for tornadoes at our locations in the midwestern united states and for earthquakes at our locations along the west coast of the united states 
in fiscal year  our business was adversely affected by hurricanes katrina  wilma and rita 
in fiscal year  hurricane ike impacted our houston operations 
our insurance may not protect us from all material losses or expenses incurred in connection with a natural disaster 

table of contents we have an estimate included in our deferred revenue liability of approximately million primarily related to certain unidentified contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses  and we may become aware of new information that would require us to increase that estimated liability 
from time to time  contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses for which we were previously unaware 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered  but the revenue was not yet recognized 
using historical trends and statistical analyses  we have recorded an estimated liability for these items of approximately million as of october  to the extent we are made aware of contracts that exceed the estimated liability recorded  or cause us to conclude that we should increase the estimated liability recorded  we would have to record a charge to earnings for the estimated cost to deliver the products and services 
our chairman may have a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome of election of directors and other matters presented for a vote of shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 
as of october   our chairman  frank b 
stewart  jr  held  shares or approximately percent of our outstanding class a common stock and all of the  outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
there is no established public trading market for our class b common stock 
because each share of class b common stock is entitled to votes on all matters presented for a vote by our shareholders  mr 
stewart controls approximately percent of our total voting power  while holding approximately percent of our outstanding equity 
accordingly  mr 
stewart may have a significant and disproportionate influence over the election of directors and other matters requiring the affirmative vote of our shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interest of other shareholders 
additionally  because louisiana law and our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two thirds of the voting power present to approve certain major transactions such as mergers and any amendments to our articles of incorporation  mr 
stewart may have the ability to prevent the consummation of such actions  even if they are recommended by our board of directors and favored by a substantial majority of our shareholders 
we may be unable to repurchase our senior convertible notes and percent senior notes when required by the holders  or to pay the cash portion of the conversion value upon conversion of our senior convertible notes 
in addition  we are subject to counterparty risk on the call options relating to our senior convertible notes 
upon a change of control of our company as defined in the relevant indenture  holders of our percent senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their notes for cash at a price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  upon fundamental change events specified in the relevant indenture  holders of our senior convertible notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
also  upon conversion of our senior convertible notes  we will be required to deliver to the holders a cash payment equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted or the conversion value of the notes 
as a result  we may be required to pay significant amounts of cash to holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources to make these payments when due 
any inability to make these payments would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing these notes and would also cause cross defaults under the terms of our other debt agreements 
concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we purchased call options with respect to our class a common stock from bank of america merrill lynch international and sold warrants to bank of america merrill lynch financial markets  inc the counterparties obligations to us under the call options and warrants are guaranteed by bank of america merrill lynch co  inc by simultaneously purchasing the call options and selling the warrants  we have effectively increased the conversion premium on the senior convertible notes to percent above the market price of the class a common stock at the time of the offering 
the call options are expected to offset our exposure to dilution from conversion of the senior convertible notes because any shares we would be obligated to deliver to holders upon conversion would be delivered to us by the counterparty to the call options 
this obligation is dependent upon the financial viability of the counterparty and guarantor 
with the uncertainty in the united states financial markets  there are risks that the counterparty and guarantor may not remain financially viable or may seek bankruptcy protection 
if the counterparty and guarantor are relieved of or cannot perform this obligation  then at the time of conversion  we may be required to issue additional shares based upon the initial conversion price of the notes and cause further dilution to our shareholders 

table of contents the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold contemporaneously with the sale of our senior convertible notes may affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
the counterparties to the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold may engage in hedging activities and modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to the conversion or maturity of our senior convertible notes  and particularly around the time of any conversion of the notes 
these hedging activities may include purchasing and selling shares of our class a common stock  or other of our securities  or other instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments 
the effect  if any  of these activities on the trading price of our class a common stock or the senior convertible notes will depend in part on market conditions at the time and cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
for additional information about the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item exercise of the outstanding warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we sold warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share and warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share 
the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in  and the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in the warrants may be settled in cash at our election 
exercise of the warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
in connection with the fiscal year and repurchases of our senior convertible notes  the number of shares of class a common stock subject to the warrants was reduced to million related to the senior convertible notes due in and million related to the senior convertible notes due in for additional information  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on any variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
we have no variable rate long term debt agreements besides our senior secured revolving credit facility 
although we have no amounts currently drawn under the credit facility  any amounts borrowed in the future are subject to variable interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt or indebtedness incurred in the future  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share materially 
our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants under our senior secured revolving credit facility and percent senior notes is dependent upon many factors 
covenant restrictions may also limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the percent senior notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries activities 
our senior secured revolving credit facility limits  among other things  our and the guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and create liens on our assets 
in addition  our senior secured revolving credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures 
furthermore  our senior secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy periodic financial condition tests 
the indenture governing the percent senior notes restricts our and the guarantors ability to create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with other companies 
our and our subsidiaries future indebtedness may contain similar or even more restrictive covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information on our debt covenants 

table of contents these covenants may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
we might not meet those covenants  and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet those covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default under such indebtedness 
if an event of default under our senior secured credit facility occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
any such declaration would also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the percent senior notes 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources included in item the payment of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to uncertainties 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we may not be able to consummate significant acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses successfully 
although we have not made any significant acquisitions in recent years  we may in the future 
also  our new invention initiative calls for us to seek to generate new tangential growth opportunities not tied to the growth of our base business 
any such acquisitions and investments have risks 
we may fail to identify suitable candidates  and even if we do  we may not be able to successfully complete the transaction or integrate the new business into our existing business 
we may not be able to find businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter new markets 
due in part to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such acquisitions or investments may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business is complex  and we have had significant changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
no assurances can be given that we will not face similar issues in the future 
our industry is unusual because we often sell products and services many years prior to the time they are required to be delivered  and we are required by varying state laws to hold customer funds related to these sales in trust until the products and services are ultimately delivered 
the accounting for these unusual features is complex  and in prior years there have been periodic changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
some of these changes have made it difficult to compare results from one period to the next 
such changes have also increased our administrative costs 
we can give no assurances that we will not face similar issues in the future 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term  and reliable statistics on deaths in particular markets can be difficult to obtain 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline and could cause a decline in the number of preneed sales being delivered  both of which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer life spans could reduce the rate of deaths 
changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
however  generally the number of deaths fluctuates with the seasons with more deaths occurring during the winter months primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from time to time may not necessarily be 
table of contents meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
we have experienced an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations  which we believe is part of the continuing national trend toward increased cremation 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations could represent approximately percent of deaths in the united states by the year  compared to percent in in fiscal years    and  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our operations were cremations  and the percentage of those that were direct cremations has increased 
a full service cremation  which includes a funeral service  merchandise and memorialization of the remains in a mausoleum or columbarium niche or a burial of the remains  can result in funeral and cemetery revenue and profit margins similar to those of traditional funeral services and burials  although the cemetery property sale revenue would generally be lower 
in contrast  a basic or direct cremation  with no funeral service or casket and no memorialization of the remains  produces no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues and profit margins for funeral operations when delivered through a traditional funeral home 
during fiscal years through  we experienced a reduction in the proportion of full service traditional funeral services and cremations and an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations 
a continuation of this trend would adversely affect the revenues and gross profits of our funeral and cemetery businesses 
to address this trend  we have been intensifying our efforts to market full service cremations and have begun a program of enhancing our cremation memorialization offerings in our cemeteries 
in addition  the increasing trend towards cremations in the united states could cause us to lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
funeral homes and cemetery businesses must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the ftc  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  puerto rican and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several jurisdictions and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  impose or increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of

the bill was referred to the subcommittee on commerce  manufacturing and trade on march  and no further action has been taken 
we cannot predict the effect this legislation might have on us if passed

table of contents our backlog of preneed funerals is comprised of trust funded contracts and insurance funded contracts 
as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item  insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   percent of our preneed funeral backlog is comprised of trust funded contracts and percent is insurance funded contracts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of october   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings  finance charges on installment sale contracts for cemetery property and trust management fees 
we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale 
general by focusing on our long term strategic plan  we maintained a strong balance sheet and improved revenue  gross profit  earnings and earnings per share during fiscal year we reported earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  total revenue of million and total gross profit of million in fiscal year our net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax insurance settlement related to the successful resolution of our litigation related to hurricane katrina damages 
in fiscal year  we reported earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  total revenue of million and total gross profit of million 
our operating results in were strong in comparison to the last few fiscal years 
during fiscal year  we experienced the highest net earnings and earnings per share  the highest increase in same store funeral calls  the highest annual cemetery property sales and the lowest corporate general and administrative costs in the last three fiscal years 
we generated million in operating cash flow during fiscal year and had million of cash and marketable securities and no amounts borrowed on our million senior secured revolving credit facility at fiscal year end 
during fiscal year  we announced a percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 
per share and returned million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends 
we repurchased million shares  or percent  of our outstanding class a common stock for million under our share repurchase program 
we invested million in acquisitions  completed construction of two new funeral homes and expensed million related to spending on e commerce and third party growth initiatives  which we expect to produce new revenue for us in the future 
we also extended our debt maturity profile at favorable terms  refinancing our million senior notes and increasing the size and extending the maturity of our senior secured revolving credit facility 
during fiscal year  same store funeral services increased percent and we experienced a percent increase in our average revenue per traditional funeral and a percent increase in our average revenue per cremation service 
during the fiscal year  we have improved the average revenue per cremation event  and increased the number of cemetery sales to cremation customers  by emphasizing to the cremation family the benefit of memorializing a life well lived 
throughout the last few years  we have addressed funeral service volumes and increases in cremation through our best in class initiative  enhanced sales and marketing efforts and our emphasis on personalization 
we have intensified our efforts to market full service cremations  including better marketing of our memorialization options to our cremation consumers 
we have also increased our cremation staff  including individuals with extensive industry and cremation experience  to support our current operations and sales teams in 
table of contents growing cremation revenues and profits 
in addition  in fiscal year we began to develop cremation gardens and other cremation memorialization projects in our cemeteries 
we have successfully completed nine cremation projects  and we currently have projects under construction with more than additional projects under feasibility review 
in fiscal year  we spent approximately million on these projects and plan to spend approximately million in fiscal year this spending represents a shift from traditional cemetery inventory spending to cremation inventory spending 
additional information about our business and strategies can be found in item business 
our trust earnings continue to be impacted by the volatility in the financial markets 
the adverse financial market conditions throughout the latter part of fiscal year and the early part of fiscal year caused a decrease in our revenue from trust activities 
from fiscal through  we recognized million  million  million  million and million in revenue from trust related activities  respectively 
during fiscal through  our trust portfolios had total returns of percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  in our preneed trusts and percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  in our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
some of the equity securities in our trust portfolios have been in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time 
many of these securities increased in value as the equity markets recovered in the to time frame  but declined significantly when the equity markets experienced dramatic declines at the end of and early at their lowest quarter end point  our trust portfolios reached a net unrealized loss position of million as of january  after these declines  the equity markets generally improved  and as of april  our portfolios had improved to a net unrealized loss position of million 
however  the equity markets again experienced significant declines in the summer of and have been highly volatile since 
the equity markets have not regained the levels reached in we reviewed the performance of the equity securities in our trust portfolios as of october  and identified securities where we believed the return required to regain our weighted average cost basis in the security was not likely to be achieved over a reasonable period of time 
we considered factors specific to  and analyst forecasts for  each individual security 
we also considered analyst forecasts for future stock market performance  which is in our opinion uncertain 
as of october   we have concluded that a number of securities in our trust portfolios are other than temporarily impaired 
for these securities  we no longer believe that we have the ability  or in some cases  the intent to hold the securities until they recover their cost value 
we have written the cost basis of these securities down to their fair market value as of october  the aggregate amount of the other than temporary impairment recorded in our preneed trusts was million  of which approximately percent was in the financial services sector 
this impairment had no impact on our balance sheet  as the securities in our preneed trust portfolios and corresponding liabilities are already recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet 
the impairment also had no impact on our income statement for fiscal year  however  these impairments will be allocated to the underlying contracts in our preneed trusts as of october   and will be recognized as the services and merchandise are performed and delivered in the future 
given that the contracts in our preneed trusts have historically had an average term of approximately years  we project that this impairment could decrease our revenue and gross profit for the foreseeable future by approximately million to million per year 
the aggregate amount of the other than temporary impairment recorded with respect to securities in our perpetual care trusts was million  of which approximately percent was in the financial services sector 
this impairment also had no impact on our balance sheet as the securities in our perpetual care trusts and the corresponding liabilities are already recorded at fair market value 
the impairment also had no impact on our income statement  as we have determined that it does not create a probable funding obligation 
the majority of these securities are paying dividends  which we withdraw to provide maintenance at the cemetery 
we will continue to closely monitor these securities 
as of october   after considering the other than temporary impairments described above  we had securities with a cost basis of million and fair market value of million that have been in an unrealized 
table of contents loss position on a weighted average cost basis for more than years  and securities with a cost basis of million and fair market value of million that have been in an unrealized loss position on a weighted average cost basis for five to years 
these securities represented percent and percent  respectively  of the total fair market value of the securities in our trust portfolios and approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the total unrealized losses in the portfolios as of october  for the securities in a loss position as of october  that we have concluded are not other than temporarily impaired  we have reviewed each security individually and determined that it is not other than temporarily impaired 
these securities need to appreciate in value percent per year over a year period to recover their cost basis 
however  our overall weighted average return for the past years  including one of the worst downturns in the financial markets is percent 
based on our historical weighted average return  analyst price targets and recommendations and our analysis of the performance of these companies  we expect to be able to  and intend to  hold these securities until they recover in value 
during late fiscal  we reviewed alternative asset allocation models and selected new asset allocation goals that emphasize diversification and reduce volatility 
we have taken advantage of the improvement in the overall markets to adjust our asset allocation towards these goals 
financial summary for fiscal year for fiscal year  net earnings were million compared to net earnings of million for fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax insurance settlement related to hurricane katrina 
total revenue increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year  compared to million in total revenue for fiscal year funeral revenue increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year our same store funeral operations experienced a percent increase in average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in average revenue per cremation service 
these increases were partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced cremation services resulting in an overall increase of percent in same store average revenue per funeral service 
same store funeral services increased percent  or events 
for the year ended october  we had a percent increase in net preneed funeral sales 
preneed funeral sales are deferred until the underlying contracts are performed and have no impact on current revenue 
cemetery revenue increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year this improvement is primarily due to a million  or percent  increase in cemetery property sales  coupled with a million improvement in revenue related to trust activities 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in finance charges as a result of reduced interest rates in this low interest rate environment and a million decrease in merchandise delivered 
consolidated gross profit increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year cemetery gross profit increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year  even after considering a million positive impact in fiscal year of perpetual care withdrawals related to prior cancellations which we used to offset our perpetual care expenses 
funeral gross profit increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in funeral revenue  partially offset by an increase in funeral expenses 
this increase in expenses is primarily due to changes made in our compensation package to incentivize improvements in operational performances  as well as an increase in health and general liability insurance  funeral bad debt and energy costs 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for fiscal year  compared to million for the same period during fiscal year  we experienced increased litigation costs primarily related to the settlement of litigation 
during fiscal year  we realized cost savings from our continuous improvement initiatives 
the savings from the continuous improvement initiative were used to fund million of expenses related to spending on e commerce and third party growth initiatives  which we expect to produce new revenue for us in the future 
for additional information on our e commerce and third party growth initiatives see item business operations 
interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal year primarily due to the significant repurchases of a portion of our senior convertible notes in the open market that occurred through fiscal year 
table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the increased rate in fiscal year is primarily due to a million charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to a change in puerto rican tax legislation 
this charge to tax expense was offset primarily by a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry forward  due in part to the performance of our trust portfolio during fiscal year in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a million tax benefit caused by the reduced valuation allowance on the capital loss carry forward and a million tax benefit attributable to the utilization of state net operating loss carryovers realized from our state tax planning strategies 
during fiscal year  we increased our quarterly cash dividend to 
per share from 
per share  and added million to our share repurchase program 
we paid million in dividends to our shareholders in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year throughout fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for million under our stock repurchase program 
subsequent to year end  we repurchased an additional million shares of our outstanding class a common stock for million 
currently  we have million remaining under our million program 
in april  we completed refinancing transactions that significantly extended our debt maturity profile at favorable terms 
we issued million of percent senior notes due and repurchased million of our million outstanding percent senior notes due we redeemed the remaining million of percent senior notes outstanding in may at par 
we also amended our million revolving credit facility  which was undrawn and scheduled to mature in june  to increase its size to million and extend its maturity to april the amended million senior secured revolving credit facility remains undrawn 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a charge for the early extinguishment of debt of million during fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to million of the hurricane katrina settlement received during the fourth quarter of in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  primarily driven by the timing of trust withdrawals and deposits  partially offset by an increase in inventory and receivables 
these increases are due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with the retail land sale provisions of asc property  plant and equipment 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  and the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are ultimately delivered 
this is made up of approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance 
this represents the face value of the backlog taking into account unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses including impairments on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the current face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our historical experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
in addition  in fiscal years and  the analysis assumes a weighted annual return of approximately 
table of contents percent projected from our trusts over the expected life of the contracts and zero percent for increasing death benefits as it is at the discretion of the insurance company 
actual results could differ materially from our assumptions used in the calculation 
proceeds of these insurance policies may be used by customers for other purposes and are portable to other funeral service providers or for completely separate purposes 
supplemental trust portfolio information we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services together with the preneed funeral merchandise and services trust  preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care 
the size of the trusts depends primarily upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of dividend and interest income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
as of october   approximately percent of our trust portfolio was invested in cash  percent in fixed income securities  percent in equities  percent in real estate index funds  percent in commodity index funds  percent in master limited partnership index funds and percent in other investments 
our trust portfolios and trust earnings continue to be impacted by volatility in the financial markets and contain a substantial proportion of equity securities

we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position and whether a charge to earnings to record a liability for any expected losses is required 
no charge has ever been required 
for additional information  see note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item and overview of critical accounting policies 
we generate revenue related to the trusts from investment management fees earned by our subsidiary  iti 
during fiscal years through  these fees amounted to million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
these fees are based on the fair market value of the investments in the preneed trust portfolio and the cemetery perpetual care trusts 
significant changes in the fair market value of the portfolio impact the fees earned by the company 
impact of preneed sales on near term cash the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the timing of the tax payments on the sale  whether the sale is funded by trust or insurance  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contracts such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed trust sales are generally cash flow 
table of contents negative initially  but may become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
generally preneed insurance sales are slightly cash flow positive as commissions received generally exceed the commissions paid to sales counselors 
commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred 
cash flows related to earnings in our trusts  deposits and withdrawals and related matters and our cemetery perpetual care funding obligations are described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements included in item overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are ultimately performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are ultimately performed 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is ultimately performed or merchandise is actually delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of asc  property  plant and equipment 
under this guidance  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to completion of its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by our preneed trusts including impairments until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 
unrealized capital gains and losses are not allocated to specific contracts 
from time to time  unidentified contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered 
using historical trends and statistical analysis  we have recorded an estimated net liability for these items 
perpetual care funding obligation certain states allow us to withdraw realized capital gains from cemetery perpetual care trusts  while other states prohibit these withdrawals 
these earnings and related funds are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs and are recorded as revenue 
in the event that we have been allowed to withdraw realized gains from the trust and then realize net losses in the trust  we may determine we have a funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of the trust 
a charge is recorded in the statement of earnings at the time it is considered probable that we will be required to restore the realized losses 

table of contents loss contract analysis each quarter we perform an analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and realized earnings  then subtract realized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts as of that particular balance sheet date 
we then consider unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of adjusted proceeds after considering net unrealized gains and losses to the estimated direct costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of funeral and cemetery merchandise costs and salaries  supplies and equipment related to the delivery of a preneed contract 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our deferred revenue 
due to the positive margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have experienced in prior years  there is currently sufficient capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would occur 
no such charges have ever been recorded 
variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
for a more detailed discussion of our related accounting policies  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not recorded on our balance sheet  as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item determination of whether securities held in trusts are other than temporarily impaired we have significant unrealized losses in securities held in our trust portfolios 
determining whether these losses are temporary or other than temporary is inherently subjective 
to determine whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary  we analyze the securities on an individual trust account basis as well as a security by security basis 
the evaluation first considers whether we have sufficient liquidity within each individual trust account to hold the investments in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time 
the liquidity assessment of the individual trust accounts includes estimates of annual trust income  historical deposits and withdrawals  cash balances  upcoming debt investment maturities and other liquidity alternatives 
we also evaluate consensus analyst recommendations  concerns specific to the issuer  overall market performance and annual returns required to recover the loss 
we also evaluate whether we have an intent to hold the security until it recovers in value 
if we determine that an unrealized loss is other than temporary  we must write down the cost basis of the impaired security to fair value at that time  which would generally be the current trading price 
any subsequent recovery in fair value cannot be recognized until the security is sold 
any losses realized from other than temporary impairments of securities held in our trusts generally would have no immediate impact on our balance sheet  because our trust portfolio securities are already carried at fair market value on our balance sheet 
in our preneed trusts  losses from other than temporary impaired securities generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow 
however  such losses would be allocated to the underlying contracts and would have an adverse impact on the amount of future revenue recognized from the trusts at the time the specific contract is ultimately performed 
accordingly  a determination that any significant losses in these trust portfolios are other than temporary could have a material adverse effect on our future trust earnings 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  such losses generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the losses caused us to realize a probable funding obligation as described in item a 
risk factors and overview of critical accounting policies perpetual care funding obligation 
for additional information on our other than temporary impairment analysis in fiscal year  see item overview general 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of our historical collection and write off experience 
in addition  we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity 
this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue 
we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance and third party commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily using the straight line method 
buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
equipment is generally depreciated over the following ranges light equipment  to years  heavy equipment  years  computer equipment  to years  and crematory equipment  to years 
vehicles are generally depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated 
gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not our operating regions are considered economically similar 
qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services  consistency of products and services and the delivery of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries  the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation  we have eleven reporting units 
because goodwill impairment tests are applied at the reporting unit level  a change in a reporting unit can have a material effect on the outcome of the test 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill was allocated to these reporting units based on the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we calculated the fair value  or enterprise 
table of contents value  for each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as supplemented by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda 
we also reviewed multiples used in recent acquisition transactions within the deathcare industry 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  which amends asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the amended guidance simplifies how entities test for goodwill impairment 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if performing the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we elected to early adopt this guidance effective for our impairment test for the fiscal year ended october  and applied the qualitative assessment to all of our reporting units 
for one of our cemetery reporting units which has a goodwill balance of million  we proceeded directly to step one of the impairment test and performed a quantitative analysis due to the fact that it had a more narrow margin between carrying value and enterprise value than our other reporting units 
from a qualitative perspective  in evaluating whether it is more likely than not ie  a probability of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  relevant events and circumstances were taken into account  with greater weight assigned to events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amounts of its assets 
items that were considered include  but are not limited to  the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  costs of merchandise or labor  overall financial performance  other entity specific events  such as changes in management or key personnel  events affecting a reporting unit  such as a change in the composition of net assets or an expected disposition  and a change in entity s share price 
after assessing these and other factors  we determined that is was more likely than not that the fair value of all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying amounts 
for the one reporting unit in which we performed a quantitative analysis  the goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
we determined the fair value of the reporting unit based on present value techniques including discounted cash flows 
the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
in projecting our cash flows  we used growth rates generally ranging from one to five percent in revenues and costs  and also considered additional cremation gardens and other mausoleum projects that are currently under construction 
for the discount rate  we used percent  which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry  suppliers and capital structure as adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
the terminal value is calculated as the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period divided by the discount rate minus terminal growth rates ranging from to percent 
we considered a sensitivity analysis of the terminal values and used the midpoint enterprise value as our best estimate 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal  state and united states possessions  capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal  state and united states possessions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change in this allowance in a period  we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 

table of contents approximately percent of the october  fair market value of our preneed trusts are in trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  may require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will pay higher taxes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the guidance on uncertain tax positions in asc  income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before to the extent tax  interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions in the future  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of tax expense  interest expense or other expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies but below our deductible 
with respect to health insurance  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incur due to damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our policy is to record such amounts when recovery is probable  which generally means we have reached an agreement with the insurance company

for additional information on our e commerce and third party growth initiatives  see item business operations 
in august  we successfully settled litigation related to hurricane katrina damages for million  including million that was advanced to the company in fiscal year interest expense decreased million to million during fiscal year primarily due to the significant repurchases of our senior convertible notes in the open market that occurred through fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the increased rate in fiscal year is primarily due to a million charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to a change in puerto rican tax legislation 
this charge to tax expense was offset primarily by a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry forward  due in part to the performance of our trust portfolio during fiscal year in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a million tax benefit caused by the reduced valuation allowance on the capital loss carry forward and a million tax benefit attributable to the utilization of state net operating loss carryovers realized from our state tax planning strategies

over the last five years  we have generated more than million each year in cash flow from operations 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash flows from operations 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under our amended million senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future

the remaining million of the percent senior notes were redeemed in may at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the tender offer was funded with the net proceeds of the issuance of million of percent senior notes due and with available cash 
also in april  we amended our million senior secured revolving credit facility which was set to mature in june the amended senior secured revolving credit facility matures on april   was increased to million and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
we may also request the addition of a new tranche of term loans  an increase in the commitments to the facility or a combination thereof not to exceed million 
as a result of these debt transactions  we recorded a million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt

we also increased our stock repurchase program by million in june and an additional million september resulting in a million program 
under the program  we purchased million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended october  in november  we purchased an additional million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million and as of november   had million remaining available under the program 
repurchases under the program are limited to our class a common stock  and are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
we believe that the use of our cash to make acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses  construct funeral homes on existing cemeteries  cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or in strategic locations  develop inventory  pay dividends and repurchase debt and stock are all attractive options 
we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions and investments is a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
we are working on several e commerce initiatives that we expect will provide new revenue in the future and are continuing to invest in further improving our business processes 
during fiscal year  we began to develop cremation gardens and other cremation memorialization projects in our cemeteries 
we have completed nine cremation projects  and we currently have projects under construction with more than additional projects under feasibility review 
in fiscal year we spent approximately million on these projects and plan to spend approximately million in fiscal year this spending represents a shift from traditional cemetery inventory spending to cremation inventory spending 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require us to draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility or pursue additional debt or equity financing 
during the year ended october   we invested million of available cash in the acquisitions of two funeral home cemetery combinations and completed construction of two new funeral homes 
we plan to start construction of one new funeral home in we had been unable to finalize negotiations with our insurance carrier related to damages from hurricane katrina  and as a result filed suit against the carrier in august in august  the insurance litigation was settled for million  and we received million in additional insurance proceeds 
we recorded this settlement amount  in addition to the million previously advanced by the insurer in  in the hurricane related recoveries charges  net line in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended october  
table of contents during the third quarter of  the internal revenue service approved a change in one of our tax accounting methods that resulted in a combination of refunds and reductions of federal income tax payments totaling approximately million 
of that amount  million was received as a refund in fiscal year  million was received as a refund in the first quarter of  million was used to offset estimated tax payments during fiscal and the remaining million was used to offset federal income tax payments in the change related to our tax accounting method for preneed contracts in one state 
this method related to approximately million of income that was taxed prior to the actual delivery of the merchandise or services 
the change permits us to defer recognition of income for tax purposes and payment of taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is actually performed or the merchandise is actually delivered and cash is withdrawn from the trust  which generally aligns our book and tax accounting for these amounts and is consistent with our approach in the other states 
the change essentially allowed us to apply the approximately million reversal of previously reported taxable income to reduce taxable income for fiscal years    and part of we will eventually have to pay federal income taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
we received irs approval in fiscal year on five requests for changes in tax accounting methods  which resulted in the deferral of approximately million of taxable income 
these changes increase the current net operating loss to be utilized beginning in to approximately million 
the utilization of this net operating loss will significantly reduce federal income tax payments by approximately million over an approximate three year period 
we were able to utilize approximately million of the net operating loss in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year  which reduced federal income tax payments by approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
these changes primarily relate to our tax accounting methods for preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral merchandise 
these changes permit us to defer the recognition of income for tax purposes and payment of taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is provided or the merchandise is actually delivered 
we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
there were no changes in tax accounting methods during fiscal year we expect to have federal net operating losses available to us through most of fiscal year and possibly a portion of we are continuing to review all of our tax accounting methods to determine opportunities to improve our current tax position 
several possible changes are being considered that could result in additional potential reductions in future tax payments 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty what  if any  reductions in future tax payments we will obtain 
however  we currently do not expect that these potential reductions in future tax payments  if obtained  will be as substantial as those obtained in fiscal years or cash flow comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the receipt of million of the hurricane katrina settlement during the fourth quarter of in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  primarily driven by the timing of trust withdrawals and deposits  partially offset by an increase in inventory and receivables 
these increases are due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is primarily due to a million net change related to purchases and sales of certificates of deposits  marketable securities and restricted cash equivalents 
in fiscal year  we replaced a letter of credit by posting cash to satisfy collateral requirements with insurance carriers and invested the cash collateral in a money market fund 
both methods of posting collateral are available to us in the future at any time 
we also purchased two funeral cemetery combinations in fiscal year resulting in a net cash outflow of million 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital

for the year ended october   capital expenditures were million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for the construction of new funeral homes and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
the increase in maintenance capital expenditures is primarily due to several large building improvement projects undertaken in fiscal year as well as increased vehicle and equipment purchases as we assess lease versus purchase decisions for our fleet 
our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in during fiscal year  we repurchased million of our common stock compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we had million in repayments of long term debt primarily due to purchases of our senior convertible notes 
during fiscal year  we issued million of percent senior notes due and repurchased million of percent senior notes due we also paid million in debt refinancing costs during fiscal year related to the senior notes transactions and refinancing of the senior secured revolving credit facility 
dividends paid increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal year we received million of net tax refunds during fiscal year compared to receiving million in net tax refunds in fiscal year in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  partly driven by the million change in receivables due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is primarily due to million in net purchases of certificates of deposit in fiscal year  offset by a decline in capital expenditures 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a certificate of deposit account registry service program in order to obtain a higher rate of return on our cash balances  while maintaining our fdic insurance protection

our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in we had million in repayments of long term debt in due primarily to the purchases of our senior convertible notes  compared to million in repayments in in fiscal year  million was spent on stock repurchases under our current stock repurchase plan  compared to less than million in stock repurchases during contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under existing contractual arrangements 
the following table details our known future cash payments in millions related to various contractual obligations as of october  
table of contents payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt operating lease agreements non competition and other agreements total as of october   our outstanding long term debt obligations amounted to million  consisting of million of percent senior convertible notes due  million of percent senior convertible notes due  million of percent senior notes due and million of other debt

the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments related to the specified contingent obligations specified below in millions as of october  expiration by period contingent obligations total less than year years years more than years cemetery perpetual care trust funding obligations long term obligations related to uncertain tax positions in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past from our cemetery perpetual care trusts  regulators may seek replenishment of subsequent realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they cover the loss 
the estimated probable funding obligation in the cemetery perpetual care trusts in these states was million as of october  as of october   we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states that could be subject to a future funding obligation 
because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  we believe it is reasonably possible but not probable that additional funding obligations may exist with an estimated amount of approximately million  no charge has been recorded for these amounts as of october  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  we adopted the required accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions on november  in accordance with this guidance  as of october   we recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and completion of audits and possible outcomes  it is not possible to estimate the range of increase and decrease and the timing thereof of any potential cash payments
