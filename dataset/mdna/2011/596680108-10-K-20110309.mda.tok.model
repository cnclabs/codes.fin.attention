rates middlesex in january  middlesex filed an application with the njbpu seeking permission to establish a pwac and implement a tariff rate sufficient to recover increased costs of million to purchase untreated water from the new jersey water supply authority and treated water from a non affiliated regulated water 
index utility 
we cannot predict whether the njbpu will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
in march  a settlement was reached with respect to middlesex s application with the njbpu seeking permission to increase its base water rates 
the njbpu granted an increase in annual operating revenues of  or million 
the base water rate increase request was made to seek recovery of increased costs of operations  chemicals and fuel  electricity  taxes  labor and benefits  decreases in industrial and commercial customer demand patterns  as well as capital investment 
the new base water rates are designed to recover these increased costs  as well as a return on invested capital in rate base of million based on a return on equity of 
tidewater a dsic is a depsc approved rate mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in non revenue producing capital improvements to the water system between base rate proceedings 
the following summarizes tidewater s approved dsic rates from january  through january  date january  july  january  increase decrease cumulative outlook rate relief and favorable weather patterns bolstered our consolidated revenues in even though revenues for should be favorably impacted by the full year effect of the march middlesex rate increase  the tidewater dsic and the anticipated middlesex pwac  there can be no assurance that the higher level of customer water consumption experienced during the extended hot  dry period throughout our service territories in will continue in severe winter weather in early has negatively impacted our operation and maintenance costs for main breaks and snow removal  particularly in new jersey 
these weather patterns may continue  which could further increase costs 
ongoing economic conditions continue to negatively impact our customers water consumption  particularly the level of water usage by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system 
in the second half of  we began to see an increase in usage by our commercial and industrial customers 
however  we are unable to determine when these customers water demands may fully return to previous levels  or if a reduced level of demand will continue indefinitely 
we were given appropriate recognition of this decrease in demand in middlesex s march rate increase 
as discussed above  revenues and earnings are influenced by weather 
changes in usage patterns  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  are the primary factors in determining the need for rate increase requests 
we continue to implement plans to streamline operations and reduce operating costs 
middlesex and several of its subsidiaries are expected to file for rate increases in there can be no assurances however  that the respective utility commissions will approve the anticipated rate increase requests in whole or in part 
in addition  the timing of approval of these rate requests is presently not known 
as a result of ongoing challenging economic conditions impacting the pace of new residential home construction  there may be an increase in the amount of ps i costs that will not be currently recoverable in rates 
if it is determined that recovery is unlikely  the applicable ps i costs will be charged against income in the period of determination 

index the return on assets held in our retirement benefit plans during resulted in an increase in the amount available to fund current and future obligations 
we expect this will help mitigate retirement plan benefit expenses and retirement plan cash contributions in operating results by segment our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate relief  effective cost management  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years

we experienced a million decline in water use by our gms customers compared to the same period in this lower water consumption was attributable to unfavorable weather as compared to prior years as well as decreased demand by our large commercial and industrial customers 
increased revenues of million from the pwac implemented on july   offset some of the consumption revenue decline 
all other factors affecting middlesex system revenues accounted for a million decrease in revenues

new customer growth and other fees added million of revenue 
all other factors affecting tidewater system revenues accounted for a million increase in revenues 
usa pa s fees for managing the perth amboy water and wastewater systems were million higher than the same period in  due mostly to higher pass through charges and scheduled management fee increases 
all other operations accounted for a decrease of million in revenues 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase was primarily related to the following factors labor costs at our regulated entities increased million in as compared to  primarily due to increases in wages and resources necessary to meet certain additional needs as well as increased overtime incurred in connection with a higher incidence of water main breaks and system maintenance in our middlesex system 
chemical and residuals disposal expenses increased by million in as compared to although unfavorable weather patterns and economic conditions resulted in a decline in water production in our new jersey and delaware systems  costs for chemicals and residuals disposal increased due to a combination of unit cost disposal rate increases and lower quality of untreated water  as influenced by abnormally high rainfall during purchased water costs in our middlesex system increased million in as compared to  primarily due to the full year s effect of our suppliers rate increases that went into effect in the fourth quarter of employee retirement benefit plan expenses increased million  primarily resulting from increased qualified employee retirement benefit plan expenses of million  largely attributable to the investment performance of the benefit plans assets  offset by a decrease of million in life insurance program expenses due to market fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies

the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities increased million to million 
as described more fully in the results of operations section above  increased earnings was the primary reason for the increase in cash flow 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period 

index for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million 
as described more fully in the results of operations section above  lower earnings was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flow 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period  with the remainder funded by bank lines of credit and other loan commitments 
increases in certain operating costs impact our liquidity and capital resources 
during  we received rate relief for middlesex and tidewater 
we continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize the lag between the time we experience increased operating and capital costs and the time we receive appropriate rate relief 
middlesex and several of its subsidiaries are expected to file for rate increases in there can be no assurances however  that the respective utility commissions will approve the anticipated rate increase requests in whole or in part 
in addition  the timing of approval of these rate requests is not known 
capital expenditures and commitments to fund our capital program  we use internally generated funds  short term and long term debt borrowings  and when market conditions are favorable  proceeds from sales of common stock under our drp and offerings to the public 
the table below summarizes our estimated capital expenditures for the years millions distribution system production system computer systems other total estimated capital expenditures our estimated capital expenditures for the items listed above are primarily comprised of the following distribution system projects associated with installation and relocation of water mains and service lines  construction of water storage tanks  installation and replacement of hydrants and meters and our renew program  which is our program to clean and cement unlined mains in the middlesex system 
in connection with our renew program  we expect to spend million  million and million for  and  respectively 
production system projects associated with our water production and water treatment plants  including construction of a water treatment plant in our middlesex system expected to be completed in computer systems purchase of hardware and software as well as expected costs to complete implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
other purchase of vehicles and other transportation equipment  tools  furniture  laboratory equipment  security requirements and other general infrastructure needs 
the actual amount and timing of capital expenditures is dependent on customer growth  residential new home construction and sales and project scheduling 
to pay for our capital program in  we plan on utilizing internally generated funds proceeds from the sale of common stock through the drp funds available and held in trust under existing new jersey state revolving fund srf loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million and  if available  proceeds 
index from delaware and new jersey srf programs

as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 
sources of liquidity short term debt

the weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were million and million at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the broader financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the new jersey and delaware srf loan programs during and expect to participate in the new jersey and delaware srf programs for up million and million  respectively 
in february  tidewater closed on a million loan with the delaware srf 
this loan allows  but does not obligate  tidewater to draw down against a general obligation note for a specific project no later than july  the interest rate on any draw down will be set at with a final maturity of august  on the amount actually borrowed 
in december  tidewater borrowed approximately thousand under this loan

the company closed on the first mortgage bonds designated as series mm and nn in december proceeds from the series mm and nn bonds are included in restricted cash and will be used for middlesex s renew program 
substantially all of the utility plant of the company is subject to the lien of its mortgage  which includes debt service and capital ratio covenants 
the company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions 
common stock

the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its drp 
the company raised million through the issuance of million shares under the drp during 
index contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s other underlying consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  payment due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total the table above does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the effect on the timing and amount of these payments resulting from potential changes in actuarial assumptions and returns on plan assets cannot be estimated 
in  the company contributed million to its postretirement benefit plans and expects to contribute approximately million in critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to the calculation of pension and postretirement benefits  unbilled revenues  and the recoverability of certain assets  including regulatory assets 
the company bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and current operating environment 
changes in any of the variables that are used for the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for approximately of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic regulated operations regulatory accounting 
in accordance with regulatory accounting  costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and 
index obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate and economic conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not material  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
postretirement benefit plans the costs for providing postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
future postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the company s postretirement benefit plans  all of which can change significantly in future years 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to march  in addition  the company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers 
the company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions other benefits plan for substantially all of its retired employees 
employees hired after march  are not eligible to participate in the other benefits plan 
coverage includes healthcare and life insurance 
the allocation by asset category of postretirement benefit plan assets at december  and is as follows pension plan other benefits plan asset category target range equity securities debt securities cash commodities total 
index the discount rate  compensation increase rate and long term rate of return utilized for determining our postretirement benefit plans future obligations as of december  are as follows pension plan other benefits plan discount rate compensation increase long term rate of return for the valuation  costs and obligations for our other benefits plan assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits in with a decline of per year for and per year for  resulting in an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of by year the following is a sensitivity analysis for certain actuarial assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations pbo and expenses for our postretirement benefit plans pension plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase discount rate decrease other benefits plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase discount rate decrease healthcare cost trend rate increase healthcare cost trend rate decrease the discount rates used at our december measurement date for determining future postretirement benefit plans obligations and costs are determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds specific to our pension plan and other benefits plan s asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return for pension plan and other benefits plan assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
recent accounting standards see note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

index item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
