the factors listed in the section captioned risk factors  as well as any cautionary language in this report  provided examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected 
except as may be required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events after the date of this prospectus 
overview we are engaged in the research and development  manufacturing  distribution and sale of liquid and powder nutrient products for plants and animals respectively which are used in the agriculture industry 
our headquarters is in beijing  china and additional administrative offices and our manufacturing unit are located in hohhot  inner mongolia  china 
currently  we sell two lines of organic nutrient products  both based on our fulvic acid compound base a plant nutrition liquid compound and animal nutrition powder which is a food additive 
our products start with our proprietary fulvic acid base which is extracted from humic acid  and to which we add other natural substances to customize the base for use in our plant and animal product lines 
based on our internal data and research  we believe our proprietary technology for fulvic acid extraction creates some of the purest and most effective fulvic acid base on the market in china today 
we believe that our fulvic acid has a very light weight molecular composition  which may improves the overall permeability of cell walls and allows more complete transport of nutrients across plant membranes  effectively strengthening the overall health of plants 
we believe our proprietary process for extracting fulvic acid from humic acid and our patented process for mixing our plant nutrient and animal nutrient are key differentiators in the market 
we believe this will help us ensure that we have a high quality product that we can control from procurement of raw materials to final production 
we believe this also ensures our products provide reliable results from season to season 
our products start with our fulvic acid base then  in addition  we add other natural substances to customize the base for use in our plant or animal lines of products 
our plant products are intended to add naturally occurring macro and micro nutrients such as nitrogen  phosphorus  potassium  boron and zinc 
our animal product adds natural herbs which we believe may help to reduce bacterial inflammation mastitis in cows 
it also assists many animals to digest food more completely and thus we believe that our animal products may help animals who use them to be healthier 
in the year ended december   we sold approximately  tons of plant product  which represented of our total revenue or  we also sold approximately  tons of our animal product  which represented of our total revenue or  recent development from the beginning of  we pursued a vertical integration strategy by seeking to acquire lignite coal resources and constructing a new manufacturing facility nearby that would be capable of extracting humic acid from lignite coal and expanding the production capacity 
in march  we entered into an agreement with wuchuan shuntong to acquire the permit for the rights to explore  develop and produce lignite coal resources in a certain area of wuchuan county 
the cash consideration of the permit is approximately rmb million or usd million 
the permit allows us to complete all necessary administrative procedures and obtain government approvals to acquire the mineral right 
this acquisition will not be completed until yongye nongfeng makes full payment to wuchuan shuntong and receives in return the full  unencumbered title to the development rights 
yongye nongfeng is still in the process of obtaining the related government approvals 
we believe that the mineral rights will allow us to secure a long term supply of humic acid  which is a major raw material used in manufacture of fulvic acid nutrient products  and which is sourced from lignite coals 
according to a third party valuation report  the project area is estimated to contain approximately million cubic meters of lignite coal which can supply the company long term needs 
on july   yongye nongfeng set up a wholly owned subsidiary in wuchuan county  inner mongolia yongye fumin biotechnology co  ltd 
yongye fumin  with registered capital of  equivalent to rmb million  whose manufacturing facility is located in wuchuan county  nearby the lignite coal resources project 
yongye fumin is to be engaged in manufacturing and sale of fulvic acid based liquid and powder nutrient compounds  with annual production capacity to produce  ton plant nutrient product and  ton animal nutrient product 
yongye fumin was established to expand the production capacity for fulvic acid based liquid and powder nutrient compounds  and to produce humic acid using lignite coal 
the construction of the production plant of yongye fumin was completed in the fourth quarter of after the acquisition of the coal resources project is completed  with the new manufacturing facility  we expect to improve control of raw material supply and improve our cost structure as the cost of obtaining humic acid is currently the largest component of our cost of sales 
in june  yongye nongfeng entered into an agreement to acquire the customer list from its provincial level distributor in hebei province  which was completed in july the company has issued million shares of common stock and will pay an additional million or equivalent to rmb million in cash to the seller on or before march as consideration for the acquisition 
the company has commenced to trade with these customers in july the customer list is comprised of all of the sub provincial level distributors who sell the company shengmingsu plant and animal nutrient products in hebei province  which is yongye largest market in china  representing approximately and of the company revenues in and  respectively 
previously  in hebei province  yongye sold its products to its provincial level distributor who then resold those products to lower level distributors 
after the acquisition of the customer list  yongye sold directly to the sub provincial level distributors in hebei province 
sales from hebei increased period over period in the second half year of and year over year during the year of in october  the company granted  restricted shares to management and independent directors of the company in accordance with the yongye international  inc omnibus securities and incentive plan  as an incentive to such individuals to promote the success of the company s business 
shares vest on the six month anniversary of the date of grant 
management was granted  shares on october   and the independent directors were granted shares of  shares on october  factors affecting our operating results demand for our products one major tenet of the prc government s th five year national economic and social plan the nesdp is the focus towards developing china s western region 
this is one of the top five economic priorities of the nation 
the goal is to increase rural income growth which will in turn increase demand for more food and agriculture products 
currently  a large proportion of our products are sold in this western region and this government focus will increase our opportunity to sell more plant and animal nutrients to farmers who have to keep up with the demand for higher quantity and higher quality of products 
according to the asian development bank statistics  well over of the nation s billion total population is comprised of low income  rural farmers 
according to the th five year nesdp  raising the level of rural income is a top economic and social goal for the country 
many government initiatives  including removal of certain agricultural and local product taxes  have been implemented to spur rural income development 
the government expects annual rural income to grow between and through xinhua  october  
additionally  according to the national population and family planning commission  china population will reach billion by therefore  the country has the challenge of producing approximately million more tons of crops needed to feed the additional million people 
this put pressure on the agricultural system to increase production capacity 
according to the proposal of the prc government s th five year national economic and social plan  the party shall adhere to agriculture  rural areas and farmers development and insist on supporting the countryside 
improving the agriculture comprehensive production capacity  quicken the construction of large scale drought high farmland  and development of high yield  high quality and high efficiency agriculture shall be the party s focus work in agriculture 
given our products ability to increase crop yield  improve quality and enhance drought resistance  we expect accelerated utilization of fertilizers generally and this government policy will increase demand for our products 
supply of finished goods before june   we purchased our finished goods from our main supplier  inner mongolia yongye and then sold them through our distribution system 
upon obtaining the fertilizer license on june   we commenced the manufacturing of our product 
seasonality our shengmingsu products face seasonality in our sector 
in general  the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters 
and of our total sales for the year were from these quarters  respectively 
the second and third quarters drove the bulk of our overall sales in with and  respectively  of the total year s sales 
agriculture sector agriculture continues to be a heavily invested sector in china 
brand name investors continue to invest into china s agriculture space because they have confidence in china s long term outlook 
the market volume for agriculture products is large  both for domestic sales and export and there is no set threshold for foreign investment into the sector as opposed to other industries  such as energy  finance  mining  and telecommunications 
this is driven by the growing demand for higher quality food products domestically and international reliance on food products from china 
currently  china is the world s biggest grower and consumer of grains and yet must boost crop yields by at least percent a year to ensure the country has enough food to feed its billion people  according to the former minister of agriculture  sun zhengcai china economic net  july  
additional policy changes are expected to include protecting farmland and working to increase rural incomes to retain farming interest 
the goal is to maintain self sufficiency in food production because no other country can feed the world s biggest population  according to sun 
our strategy must be based on stable farmland  and seeking ways to improve yields  sun said in a speech to local officials  outlining the government s near and long term agriculture policy and objectives 
china  which harvested more summer crops  aims also to boost grain and oilseed output this year  sun said 
to ensure next year s crops  officials must stabilize area planted in winter wheat and use idle land in the off season to grow rapeseed  sun said 
this growth  however  does not come without challenges and china has faced many of these with regards to the continued concern over the quality of milk and eggs sold both domestically and internationally in the dairy industry 
we believe that the government is making every effort to bring back consumer confidence in these domestically produced products and overall this will bring about an even stronger industry once planned new licensing and safety procedures have been put into place 
new land reform policy farmland in china is owned by the local government  but given to local farmers under year use contracts 
with the allure of higher incomes and better living conditions in the city  in some places  farmers have abandoned the land and no others farmers have stepped in to bring it back into production 
this has created a shortage of productive agricultural land 
the government has acknowledged this issue and recently enacted a new land use reform policy which liberalizes the exchange of land among the nation s farmers 
this creates a new model for china s million farmers with the idea being to create more stable farmland by shifting the country away from the single household farm plot model to the amalgamation of larger scale operations which should be more productive due to technology and economies of scale 
farmers will be able to transfer their land use rights to others through a new market system for rural land use rights 
chinese authorities commented that  without modernizing agriculture  china cannot modernize  without stability and prosperity in rural areas  china cannot have stability and prosperity 
these changes are enacted to ensure national food security and the supply of major agricultural products  and promote increases in agricultural production  farm incomes and rural prosperity 
china s ongoing agriculture modernization  usda  april 
drought the recent drought across northern china  which is one of the worst droughts in northern china in recent years  began in the fourth quarter of  the last time much of the region had significant rain 
this drought has already affected millions of acres of farmland and is likely to have a major impact on the incomes of hundreds of thousands of farmers 
we believe one important benefit of yongye shengmingsu branded plant nutrient product is to help plants counteract the effects of water deprivation 
crops sprayed with shengmingsu are able to better withstand the effects of drought and continue to flourish alongside withering crops which received only traditional fertilizer 
yongye shengmingsu plant nutrient product is now being used in a number of drought affected areas to assist local farmers in combating the conditions 
many regions in china have experienced drought in the past several years and the company s growth to date was partly due to the anti natural disaster feature of its shengmingsu product 
in recent months  the company has continued to see strong demand from its distributors  who are actively promoting its products as an effective nutrient product for local farmers to counteract the drought

the increase in fair value during the year ended december  resulted in a loss of  the increase in fair value of the warrants was primarily due to the increase in our stock price from per share at january  to at december  the change in fair value of the warrants for the year ended december  resulted in a loss of  as compared with a gain of  for the year ended december  corporate income taxes the company did not carry on any business and did not maintain any branch office in the united states during the years ended december   and and does not intend to repatriate any earnings from the chinese operations

assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at the prevailing exchange rate in effect at each period end 
the income statement is translated at the average rate of exchange during the period 
translation adjustments are included in the cumulative translation adjustment account in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital expenditures principally through issuance of common shares and bank loans 
as is customary in the industry  we provide credit terms to most of our distributors which typically exceed the terms that we receive from our suppliers 
currently  we typically provide up to six months credit terms to our key distributors and ask for all others to make cash payments upfront or upon delivery 
therefore  the company s liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital necessary to finance receivables and raw material and finished goods inventory 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future cash needs for the coming growing season 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
therefore  there can be no assurance that such additional investment will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us

the cash flow used in operating activities improved by  and  for the year ended december  and compared to the preceding year  respectively 
the change was mainly due to more efficient controls on working capital  effective collection on receivables  as well as the significant growth of sales for the years ended december  and net cash used in investing activities increased by  or  to  in the year ended december   compared to  the same period in the increase was primarily due to the prepayment of  for the acquisition of the right to develop certain lignite coal resources in the wuchuan area 
total consideration of the development right is approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  or  to  in the year ended december   compared to  the same period in this was mainly due to that we received cash from our offerings in may and december amounting to  which was offset by expenses incurred in stock issuance costs of  as well as the repayment of loans and payables of  during the year ended december  net current assets at december  increased by  to  from  or  over december  impact of inflation we are subject to commodity price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the raw materials 
we have generally been able to pass on cost increases through price adjustments 
however  the ability to pass on these increases depends on market conditions influenced by the overall economic conditions in china 
we manage our price risks through productivity improvements and cost containment measures 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial position  results of operations or cash flows at this time

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the footnote to the company s financial statements summary of significant accounting policies describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the following are considered to be the company s critical accounting policies accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determined the allowance by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying historical loss rates to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
in the event that we believe an account receivable will become uncollectible  we record additional provision to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting effect of this entry is a charge to income 
currently  we have not provided an allowance to doubtful accounts  since we believe no accounts were uncollectible 
however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  in future  an allowance to doubtful accounts would be required to be make  which could be significant 
inventory we value our finished goods inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes cost of direct labor and raw materials  as well as allocation of variable and fixed production overhead 
variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production based on the actual use of the production facilities 
fixed production overheads are allocated to the cost of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we define normal production capacity as being a reasonable level of production volume supported by sufficient customer demand without any abnormal equipment downtime due to shortages of materials and labor  taking into consideration the loss of production capacity resulting from planned maintenances 
we would write down the cost of excessive inventory 
the factors considered in evaluating whether excessive inventory exists are our forecast of future demand  including existing customers order and forecasted orders  and the expiration date for the specific products 
inventory write downs are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if our current assumptions about future production  inventory levels or demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs would be required  which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value of warrants the fair values of the warrants are summarized as follows april warrants september warrants may warrants fair value of warrant per share us at date of issuance december  n a december  n a the fair values of the warrants outstanding as of december  and were determined based on the binominal option pricing model  using the following key assumptions december  december  april warrants september warrants april warrants september warrants expected volatility expected dividends yield time to maturity years years years years risk free interest rate per annum fair value of underlying common shares per share stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
however  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date 
we estimated the fair value of our nonvested shares granted by us to management and independent directors on october  and october  by using the market prices of our shares at the respective grant dates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk all of the company s revenue  and majority of costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
although the conversion of the rmb is highly regulated in china  the value of the rmb against the value of the us dollar or any other currency nonetheless may fluctuate and be affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
under current policy  the value of the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
china is currently under significant international pressures to liberalize this government currency policy  and if such liberalization were to occur  the value of the rmb could appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar 
because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in rmb  other than certain cash deposits we keep in a bank in hong kong and us  appreciation or depreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue in future that will be exchanged into us dollars and earnings from  and the value of  any us dollar denominated investments we make in the future 
very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currency 
interest rate risk the company has not been  nor does it anticipate being  exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 
our risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by cash deposited in interest bearing savings accounts 
the company has not used  and does not expect to use in the future  any derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest risk exposure 
however  our future interest income may fall short of its expectation due to changes in interest rates in the market 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk from its cash in bank and accounts receivable 
the credit risk on cash in bank and fixed deposits is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial institutions 
accounts receivable are subjected to credit evaluations 
an allowance would be made  if necessary  for estimated irrecoverable amounts by reference to past default experience  if any  and by reference to the current economic environment 
inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs  could impair our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
company s operations are substantially in foreign countries substantially all of our operations are conducted in china and are subject to various political  economic  and other risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting business in china 
among other risks  the company and its subsidiaries operations are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds  export duties  quotas  and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  and political conditions and governmental regulations 
additional information regarding such risks can be found under the heading risk factors in this form k
