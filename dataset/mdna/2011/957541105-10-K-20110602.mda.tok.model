conferenceplus is a owned subsidiary of the company and manages its conferencing and meeting services through its main operations center in schaumburg  illinois  and a facility in dublin  ireland 
conferenceplus allows multiple individuals  organizations and or businesses to conduct conference calls using a combination of audio  web and video collaboration and presentations 
conferenceplus offers conference call services that can include a blend of audio  graphics  spreadsheets and other documents that can be carried over and archived on the internet to enhance the traditional audio conference call

these technologies also help companies communicate and collaborate effectively in the face of health and safety threats and other impediments to travel and formal gatherings 
the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria  and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
the company s customer base for its products is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major us telecommunications service providers telephone companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
in view of the company s current reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
after the cns asset sale to netgear  in the cns segment  the company is focusing on the homecloud product development program as well as fulfilling its contractual obligations in the retained cns customer relationship and contract

the company continues to invest in new product areas to compliment the cellular backhaul and smart grid applications 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 

table of contents inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potentially obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory to adjust valuations to be the lower of cost or market value 
prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into non cancellable commitments for the purchase of inventory and long distance telephone services 
the commitments are at market rates 
should there be a significant decline in revenues the company may absorb excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company establishes reserves for potential losses on at risk commitments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to the requirements of accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at an interim period if indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner used to determine the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology and current like company market transactions 
in fiscal year  impairment of million was recorded at the noran tel reporting unit in the osp segment 
no impairment was recorded in fiscal years or on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue recognition on equipment where software is incidental to the product as a whole or where software is essential to the equipment s functionality and falls under software accounting scope exceptions generally occurs when products are shipped  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met  no significant obligations remain  collection is reasonably assured and warranty can be estimated 
where multiple element arrangements exist  fair value of each element is established using the relative selling price method  which requires the company to use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  reliable third party objective evidence tpe or management s best estimate of selling price  in that order 
the company s ultraline series products are sold primarily to a single customer with contractual provisions that include specified future software enhancements and post customer support pcs to maintain ongoing interoperability within the customer s network 
the company was not able to establish vsoe or tpe for the specified future software enhancements and therefore relied on management s estimates of fair value for each of the multiple elements in the arrangement 
revenue is deferred for undelivered elements and recorded when delivery occurs 

table of contents stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires the grant date fair value recognition of expense related to employee stock based compensations awards over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of equity based options requires the company to estimate the expected volatility of its stock  the risk free interest rate  expected option term  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
warranty costs most of the company s products carry a limited warranty ranging from one to three years for cns segment products and up to seven years for osp segment products 
the warranty reserve is based on historical sales and cost of repair or replacement trends 
new accounting standards adopted in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  consolidations topic amendments for certain investment funds and in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
these asu s amend the variable interest entity vie guidance of asc see effective date below 
effective april   the company adopted the new vie guidance of asc this guidance amends asc  to require the company to perform an analysis of existing investments to determine whether variable interest or interests give the company a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of significant impact on a vie and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
it also amends asc to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
as a result of adoption  the company is no longer considered the primary beneficiary of contineo  a vie for which the company was considered the primary beneficiary and which required the financial performance of contineo to be consolidated in the company s financial statements in fiscal years and because the company is no longer considered the primary beneficiary  the company is not required to consolidate contineo in its financial statements effective april  as a result of the adoption of the new vie guidance in asc  the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to increase retained earnings by million

the company tests goodwill for impairment annually in its fiscal fourth quarter and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment are present 
a two step approach is used to test for goodwill impairment 
the first step tests for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the second step  which is performed only if the fair value in step one is lower than the carrying value  measures the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and current like company market transactions 
the key assumptions used to determine fair value include the weighted average cost of capital as well as projections on revenue  costs and capital expenditures 
no impairment was identified during fiscal years and due to the adverse economic environment  an interim impairment test was performed on the noran tel reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal year that resulted in a million charge to adjust goodwill in the unit to its fair value
