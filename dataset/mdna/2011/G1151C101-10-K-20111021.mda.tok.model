we use the terms accenture  we  the company  our and us in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal year  which ends on august for example  a reference to fiscal means the month period that ended on august  all references to quarters  unless otherwise noted  refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 
we use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance 
financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates 
this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
overview our results of operations can be affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
revenues before reimbursements net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
this very strong growth during fiscal contrasts with a local currency revenue decline during fiscal  compared to fiscal all of our operating groups experienced year over year revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with very strong growth in resources and products 
based on new contract bookings over the last several quarters  we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business 
we also expect the level of year over year growth will moderate  particularly in consulting  and vary across operating groups and geographic regions 
there continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world  as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty 
such volatility and uncertainty  should it continue  could adversely affect our clients and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate 
we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 
in our consulting business  net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
consulting net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
all five operating groups experienced year over year consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal  driven by very strong growth in resources and products 
in our consulting business overall  clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency  as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

table of contents compared to fiscal  we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower cost resources in our global delivery network and we expect this trend to continue in the medium term 
while the business environment remains competitive  pricing is stable with some improvement in certain areas of our business 
in our outsourcing business  net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
outsourcing net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
all five operating groups experienced year over year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal  led by communications high tech and financial services 
clients continue to be focused on projects that will improve operational effectiveness 
growth in outsourcing is driven by higher volumes  scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients  as well as services for new clients 
as with systems integration consulting  compared to fiscal we are providing a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower cost resources in our global delivery network 
as we are a global company  our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
if the us dollar weakens against other currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher 
if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  resulting in unfavorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower 
when compared to fiscal  the us dollar weakened against many currencies during fiscal this resulted in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue results that were approximately and better than our results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal  respectively 
the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs 
cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  subcontractor and other personnel costs  and non payroll outsourcing costs 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services  the utilization of our client service personnel and the level of non payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts 
utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work 
utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately and within our target range 
this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries 
we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 
we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services  given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
based on current and projected future demand  we have increased our headcount  the majority of which serve our clients  to approximately  as of august   compared with approximately  as of may  and  as of august  this year over year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services  including those delivered through our global delivery network in lower cost locations 
annualized attrition  excluding involuntary terminations  for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with in the third quarter of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we adjust levels of new hiring  evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand 
in addition  we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees  and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future 
for the majority of our personnel  compensation increases for fiscal became effective september  as in prior fiscal years  we strive to adjust pricing and or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin 
our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins 
table of contents could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand  mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis  manage attrition  recover increases in compensation and or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 
gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal our contract profitability for fiscal was lower than fiscal  as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix 
gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand 
sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities  investment in offerings  and marketing and advertising related activities 
general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems and office space 
we continuously monitor these costs and implement cost management actions  as appropriate  to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues 
these actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower cost locations 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased  while general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues 
the decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues  as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve  partially offset by a provision for litigation matters 
while we continue to manage these costs  we expect the reduction in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues to moderate in fiscal our margins could be adversely affected if our cost management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 
operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared with million for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income for fiscal was  million  compared with  million for fiscal operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs 
most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues 
where practical  we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs 
we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues
