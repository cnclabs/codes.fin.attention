table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section is intended to help potential investors understand our financial performance through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at september  and  and our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended september  and this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
overview historically  we have operated as a traditional community savings bank 
at september   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of longer term  one to four family residential real estate loans  of which million  or  were fixed rate loans and million  or were adjustable rate loans 
this resulted in our being particularly vulnerable to increases in interest rates  as our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
however  in recent years  we have increased our focus on the origination of commercial real estate loans  which generally provide higher yields than one to four family residential mortgage loans  have shorter durations and are usually originated with adjustable interest rates 
other than our loans for the construction of one to four family residential properties and home equity lines of credit  we do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties where the borrower pays interest but no principal for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan 
we also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we do not offer subprime loans loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies  previous charge offs  judgments  bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt burden ratios or alt a loans traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
we also do not own any private label mortgage backed securities that are collateralized by alt a  low or no documentation or subprime mortgage loans 
at september   of our mortgage backed securities have been issued by freddie mac  fannie mae or ginnie mae  us government agencies or government sponsored enterprises 
these entities guarantee the payment of principal and interest on our mortgage backed securities 
our non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets at september   compared to million  or  of total assets at september  we had million of loans delinquent days or greater at september  and september  we provided million for loan losses during the fiscal year ended september  and million during the fiscal year ended september   reflecting an increase in nonperforming loans  as well as a higher percentage of commercial real estate loans which have greater risk relative to one to four family residential real estate loans  and worsening economic conditions 
business strategy our primary objective is to operate as a profitable  community oriented financial institution serving customers in our market areas 
we have sought to accomplish this objective by adopting a business strategy that is designed to maintain strong capital and high asset quality 
this business strategy includes the following elements remaining a community oriented financial institution while continuing to increase our customer base of small and medium size businesses in our market area 
we were established in and have operated continuously in the pittsburgh metropolitan area since that date 
in  we acquired hoblitzell national bank  which expanded our branch network to bedford county  pennsylvania and allegany county  maryland 
we are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate  and we are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers 
we provide a broad range of consumer and business financial services from our ten banking offices  and have expanded our commercial real estate staff to enhance our capacity to serve small businesses in our market area 

table of contents increasing commercial real estate lending while maintaining our conservative loan underwriting standards 
our loan portfolio balance has increased in recent years due in part to the growth in our commercial real estate loan portfolio to million  or of our gross loan portfolio at september   from million  or of our gross loan portfolio at september  this growth was due in part to the acquisition of hoblitzell national bank  a commercial bank that emphasized commercial real estate lending 
in growing our commercial loan portfolio  we have emphasized maintaining strong asset quality by following conservative loan underwriting guidelines 
we underwrite all of our loans in our main office to ensure uniformity and consistency in underwriting decisions 
emphasizing deposits by attracting new customers and enhancing existing customer relationships 
in an effort to grow our banking franchise  we have enhanced our direct marketing efforts to local businesses and established a stronger culture of cross selling our products to our existing customers 
in addition  we attract and retain deposits by offering enhanced technology  such as online banking and remote deposit capture  with a continued emphasis on quality customer service 
expanding our branch network  primarily through branch purchases and de novo branching 
we currently operate from ten banking offices 
on april   a new branch was opened in greensburg  pennsylvania 
we intend to evaluate additional branch expansion opportunities  primarily through branch purchases and de novo branches  to expand our presence in our current market area 
pursuing future expansion and acquisition opportunities with the capital obtained in the conversion  although we have no current arrangements or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
we intend to evaluate acquisitions of other financial institutions  as opportunities present themselves 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount we believe is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at a balance sheet date 
management s periodic determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  an assessment of individual problem loans and actual loss experience  current economic events in relevant industries and other pertinent factors such as regulatory guidance and general economic conditions 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires an estimate of the loss content for each risk rating and for each impaired loan  an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  and an appraisal or other estimate of the value of collateral on impaired loans and estimated losses on pools of homogenous loans based on the balance of loans in each loan category  changes in the inherent credit risk due to portfolio growth  historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required  we record a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s current judgments about the loan portfolio credit quality and management s consideration of all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability  as of the reporting date 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount of loan charge offs that will be incurred 
we do not currently determine a range of loss with respect to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  various banking regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
other than temporary impairment 
in estimating other than temporary impairment of investment securities  securities are evaluated periodically  and at least quarterly  to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
we consider numerous factors when determining whether potential other than temporary impairment exists and the period over which a debt security is expected to recover 
the principal factors considered are the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and guarantor  if any and adverse conditions specifically related to the security  industry or geographic area  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of a security by a rating agency  and the presence of credit enhancements  if any  including the guarantee of the federal government or any of its agencies 

table of contents for debt securities  other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred if we intend to sell the security  it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or if the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
in determining the present value of expected cash flows  we discount the expected cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition or  for debt securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  at the current rate used to accrete the beneficial interest 
in estimating cash flows expected to be collected  we use available information with respect to security prepayment speeds  expected deferral rates and severity  whether subordinated interests  if any  are capable of absorbing estimated losses and the value of any underlying collateral 
deferred tax assets 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we must assess goodwill and other intangible assets each year for impairment 
this assessment involves estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  we would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the assets to the lower value 
balance sheet analysis september  and september  assets 
our total assets decreased  or  to million at september  from million at september  the slight decrease was due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and net loans  offset by increases in mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
cash and cash equivalents 
at september   cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on hand and due from banks and interest earning deposits 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million or to million at september  from million at september  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in interest earning deposits as proceeds from the stock conversion were used to purchase securities 
loans 
at september   net loans were million  or of total assets  a decrease of  from million at september  this slight decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the home equity and construction loan portfolios partly offset by increases in commercial real estate and commercial loans 
we have continued our focus on steadily increasing our commercial real estate loans to better diversify our loan portfolio

we held investment securities with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million at september   compared to an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million at september   respectively 
at september   our investment portfolio consisted of million of mortgage backed securities of which million were us government sponsored mortgage backed securities  million of municipal bonds  million in us government and agency obligations  million in corporate bonds and million in equity securities at fair value 
purchases of investment securities during the fiscal year ended september  of million were partly offset by maturities  repayments and calls of million 
at september  and september   the company held securities and securities in unrealized loss positions of  and  respectively 
the decline in the fair value of these securities resulted primarily from interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not intend to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that the company would be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery and the company believes the collection of the investment and related interest is probable 
based on this analysis  the company considers all of the unrealized losses to be temporary impairment losses

the provision for loan losses increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  non performing loans at september  were million or of total loans compared to million or of total loans at september  reflecting the weak and uncertain economic environment 
management analyzes the allowance for loan losses as described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses 
the provision that is recorded is sufficient  in management s judgment  to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the losses inherent in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix  economic conditions and historical loss experience 
management believes  to the best of their knowledge  that all known losses as of the balance sheet dates have been recorded 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  net securities gains increased  with gains of  recognized for the fiscal year ended september  compared to losses of  for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal year  gains of  were recognized on the sale of equity securities

excluding the one time charitable contribution  total non interest expenses increased  or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due primarily to higher personnel related costs and other operating expenses  a portion of which were due to operating as a public company  and additional expenses associated with managing and selling real estate owned properties 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended september  was  effective tax rate of compared to million effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of a lower level of income before taxes and a higher level of nontaxable interest income in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
non performing and problem assets when a residential mortgage loan  home equity loan or line of credit or consumer loan is past due  we send a late notice and contact the borrower to inquire as to why the loan is past due 
when a loan is days or more past due  we mail a second late notice and attempt additional personal  direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency and establish the procedures by which the borrower will bring the loan current 
when the loan is days past due  we explore the customer s issues and repayment options and inspect the collateral 
in addition  when a loan reaches days past due  our management determines and recommends to our board of directors whether to initiate foreclosure proceedings  which will be initiated by counsel if the loan is not brought current 
procedures for avoiding foreclosure can include restructuring the loan in a manner that provides concessions to the borrower to facilitate payment 
commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans are generally handled in the same manner as the loans discussed above 
additionally  when a loan is days past due  we contact the borrower  visually inspect the property ies and inquire of the principals the status of the loan and what actions are being implemented to bring the loan current 
depending on the type of loan  the borrower s cash flow statements  internal financial statements  tax returns  rent rolls  new or updated independent appraisals  online databases and other relevant information in bank and third party loan reviews are analyzed to help determine a course of action 
in addition  legal counsel is consulted and an approach for resolution is determined and aggressively pursued 

table of contents loans are placed on non accrual status when payment of principal or interest is days or more delinquent 
loans are also placed on non accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt 
when loans are placed on a non accrual status  unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed  and further income is recognized only to the extent received 
the loan may be returned to accrual status if payments are brought to less than days delinquent and full payment of principal and interest is expected 
impaired loans are commercial and commercial real estate loans for which it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we individually evaluate such loans for impairment rather than aggregate loans by major risk classifications 
the definition of impaired loans is not the same as the definition of non accrual loans  although the two categories overlap 
we may choose to place a loan on non accrual status due to payment delinquency or uncertain collectability  while not classifying the loan as impaired 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value 
the amount of impairment for these types of impaired loans is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan  using current interest rates  and its recorded value 
in the case of collateralized loans  the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loan 
when foreclosure is probable  impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
mortgage loans on one to four family properties  home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans are generally considered larger groups of homogeneous loans and are measured for impairment collectively 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays  which are defined as less than days  generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 

table of contents the table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non performing assets at the dates indicated

table of contents foreclosed real estate 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of foreclosure less the cost to sell  establishing a new cost basis 
estimated fair value generally represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions  including normal terms from other financial institutions 
holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition 
at september     and  we had foreclosed real estate of   million   and  respectively 
foreclosed real estate at september  consisted of four residential real estate properties with the largest balance of  for property located in a lake resort area in maryland 
classification of assets 
our policies  consistent with regulatory guidelines  provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets or portions of assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted 
assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention  are required to be designated as special mention 
if our concerns about loans in the special mention category increase as to the ability of the borrower to comply with current loan repayment terms  the loan is reclassified to one of the aforementioned categories 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount estimated to equal all credit losses incurred in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at a balance sheet date 
our determination as to the classification of our assets is subject to review by our principal federal regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation  and our state regulator  the pennsylvania department of banking 
we regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
the following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets and criticized assets classified assets and loans designated as special mention at the dates indicated

table of contents allowance for loan losses we provide for loan losses based upon the consistent application of our documented allowance for loan loss methodology 
all loan losses are charged to the allowance for loan losses and all recoveries are credited to it 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges to income based on various factors which  in our judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses 
we regularly review the loan portfolio and make provisions for loan losses  if considered necessary 
the allowance for loan losses consists primarily of two components specific allowances established for impaired loans 
the amount of impairment provided for as a specific allowance is represented by the deficiency  if any  between the estimated fair value of the loan  or the loan s observable market price  if any  or the underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  and the carrying value of the loan 
impaired loans for which the estimated fair value of the loan  or the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  exceeds the carrying value of the loan are not considered in establishing specific allowances for loan losses  and general allowances established for loan losses on a portfolio basis for loans that do not meet the definition of impaired loans 
the portfolio is grouped into similar risk characteristics  primarily loan type and regulatory classification 
we apply an estimated loss rate to each loan group 
the loss rates applied are based upon our loss experience adjusted  as appropriate  for the environmental factors discussed below 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
the adjustments to historical loss experience are based on our evaluation of several qualitative and environmental factors  including changes in any concentration of credit including  but not limited to  concentrations by geography  industry or collateral type  changes in the number and amount of non accrual loans  criticized loans and past due loans  changes in national  state and local economic trends  changes in the types of loans in the loan portfolio  changes in the experience and ability of personnel and management in the mortgage loan origination and loan servicing departments  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  changes in lending strategies  and changes in lending policies and procedures 
in addition  we may establish an unallocated allowance to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but are not reflected in the allocated allowance 
we evaluate the allowance for loan losses based upon the combined total of the specific and general components 
generally when the loan portfolio increases  absent other factors  the allowance for loan loss methodology results in a higher dollar amount of estimated probable losses than would be the case without the increase 
generally when the loan portfolio decreases  absent other factors  the allowance for loan loss methodology results in a lower dollar amount of estimated probable losses than would be the case without the decrease 
commercial real estate loans generally have greater credit risks compared to the one to four family residential mortgage loans we originate  as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related business and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy

we evaluate the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
while we use the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process  the pennsylvania department of banking and the federal deposit insurance corporation will periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking and the federal deposit insurance corporation may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis of information available to them at the time of their examination 
at september   the company had eleven impaired loans totaling million of which almost all were commercial real estate loans 
the largest impaired loan at september  was a million loan representing a interest in a participation which was secured by commercial real estate and a mall in west virginia 
at september   the company had two impaired loans totaling million both of which were commercial participation loans 
these loans were interest only loans which were current as to the interest payments as of september   however they were deemed impaired due to the financial difficulties of each of the borrowers

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  repurchase agreements and maturities  principal repayments and the sale of available for sale securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee  under the direction of our chief financial officer  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows and borrowing maturities  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short term securities and are also used to pay off short term borrowings 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  million of which were for commercial real estate loans and million of which were for one to four family loans 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers and  in undisbursed funds for construction loans in process 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totalled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we may be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan and securities sales  repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances 
we believe  however  based on historical experience and current market interest rates  we will retain upon maturity a large portion of our certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less 
our primary investing activity is originating loans 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  we originated million and million of loans  respectively 
during these years  we purchased million and million of securities  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in deposits of million and million during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  which provides an additional source of funds 
we also utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase with customers as another borrowing source 
federal home loan bank advances decreased by million and million for the fiscal year ended september  and for the fiscal year ended september   respectively 
at september   we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by  for the fiscal year ended september  and by  for the fiscal year ended september  
table of contents standard bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   standard bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
standard bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see item business supervision and regulation banking regulation capital requirements and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds from the october  stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources 
our financial condition and results of operations were enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  resulting in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income 
however  due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the stock offering  our return on equity was adversely affected following the stock offering 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans 
for additional information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities and agreements with respect to investments 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
payments due by period contractual obligations one year or less more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years total in thousands long term debt operating leases securities sold under agreements to repurchase certificates of deposit total impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because  as a financial institution  the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
historically  we operated as a traditional savings bank 
therefore  the majority of our assets consist of longer term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  which we funded primarily with checking and savings accounts and short term borrowings 
in an effort to improve our earnings and to decrease our exposure to interest rate risk  we generally sell fixed rate residential loans with a term over years 
in addition  we have shifted our focus to originating more commercial real estate loans  which generally have shorter maturities than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and are usually originated with adjustable interest rates 
in addition to the above strategies with respect to our lending activities  we have used the following strategies to reduce our interest rate risk increasing our personal and business checking accounts  which are less rate sensitive than certificates of deposit and which provide us with a stable  low cost source of funds  repaying short term borrowings  and maintaining relatively high levels of capital 
we have not conducted hedging activities  such as engaging in futures  options or swap transactions  or investing in high risk mortgage derivatives  such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests  real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair values of our financial instruments 
during the fiscal year ended september   low market interest rates were the primary factors in the increases in the fair values of our loans  deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
for additional information  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net portfolio value 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the estimated changes in our net portfolio value npv that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the interest rate yield curve 
the npv is the difference between the present value of an institution s assets and liabilities the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
historically  the model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract using the current interest rate yield curve with instantaneous increases or decreases of to basis points in basis point increments 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 

table of contents npv as a percentage of present value of assets change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv increase decrease amount percent npv ratio basis points dollars in thousands assumes interest rate changes up and down in increments of basis points 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value 
modeling changes in net portfolio value require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs  or loan repayments and deposit decay  respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
