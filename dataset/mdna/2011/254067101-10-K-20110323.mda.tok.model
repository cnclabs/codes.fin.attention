cdi is a general contractor whose business includes constructing and remodeling stores for the company  which is a reportable segment separate from our retail operations 

table of contents in accordance with the national retail federation fiscal reporting calendar  the fiscal  and reporting periods presented and discussed below ended january   january  and january   respectively  and each contained weeks 
fiscal a return of consumer confidence over the past year had a significant impact on the company operations 
retail sales and gross margin improved during the year as we remained focused on our core initiatives of disciplined inventory management and controlled spending 
we reported improved operating results  with net income increasing to million  or per share  during fiscal compared to million  or per share  during fiscal included in net income for fiscal are a million pretax charge million after tax or per share for asset impairment and store closing charges related to the write down of one property currently held for sale  a million pretax gain million after tax or per share on proceeds received for final payment related to hurricane losses  a million pretax gain million after tax or per share related to the sale of five retail store locations  and a million income tax benefit per share primarily related to net decreases in unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties due to resolutions of federal and state examinations  decreases in state net operating loss valuation allowances  and a decrease in a capital loss valuation allowance

highlights of fiscal as compared to fiscal are earnings per share of compared to for the prior year 
net income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  gross margin from retail operations improved basis points of sales compared to the prior year with a comparable store inventory decline of  operating expense leverage of basis points of sales 
operating expenses as a percent of sales were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and cash flow from operations of million allowed the repurchase of approximately million million shares of class a common stock under the company share 
table of contents repurchase programs 
total shares outstanding at january  were million shares compared to million shares at january  as of january   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and million of total debt outstanding 
we operated total stores as of january   a decrease of one store from the same period last year 
key performance indicators we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance of our business  including the following fiscal year ended retail segment only  excluding cash flow data january  january  january  net sales in millions gross profit in millions gross profit as a percentage of net sales cash flow from operations in millions total store count at end of period sales per square foot net sales trend comparable store sales trend comparable store inventory trend merchandise inventory turnover trends and uncertainties fluctuations in the following key trends and uncertainties may have a material effect on our operating results 
cash flow cash from operating activities is a primary source of liquidity that is adversely affected when the industry faces economic challenges 
furthermore  operating cash flow can be negatively affected when new and existing competitors seek areas of growth to expand their businesses 
pricing if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient quantities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our retail selling prices  the cost of goods sold on our income statement will correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income and cash flow 
success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise as well as merchandise we source from national vendors is dependent upon customer fashion preferences and how well we can predict and anticipate trends 
sourcing our store merchandise selection is dependent upon our ability to acquire appealing products from a number of sources 
our ability to attract and retain compelling vendors as well as in house design talent  the adequacy and stable availability of materials and production facilities from which we source our merchandise and the speed at which we can respond to customer trends and preferences all have a significant impact on our merchandise mix and  thus  our ability to sell merchandise at profitable prices 
store growth although store growth is presently not a near term goal  such growth is dependent upon a number of factors which could impede our ability to open new stores  such as the identification of suitable markets and locations and the availability of shopping developments  especially in a weak economic environment 

table of contents seasonality and inflation our business  like many other retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season 
because of the seasonality of our business  results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results during the periods presented  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such in the future 
in response to recent economic volatility in asia and to increasing fabric prices including cotton and overseas wages  we have sought solutions to help minimize the effects of these events on our operations during fiscal by negotiating efficiencies through our longstanding relationships with our current suppliers  considering alternative manufacturing sources  redesigning our garments and incorporating other types of fibers where appropriate and adjusting price points as necessary 
consequently  we believe the effects of these currently known trends on our gross margins in fiscal will be minimal

equity in losses of joint ventures 
equity in losses of joint ventures includes the company portion of the income or loss of the company unconsolidated joint ventures  including the equity in earnings of cdi prior to the purchase of its remaining interest and subsequent consolidation on august  critical accounting policies and estimates the company accounting policies are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out retail inventory method lifo rim 
under lifo rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
lifo rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of lifo rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the lifo rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and 
table of contents markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company lifo rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identified cost methods 
a change in the dollar amount of markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately million for fiscal the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
complete physical inventories of all of the company stores and warehouses are performed no less frequently than annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to coincide with these physical counts 
the differences between the estimated amounts of shrinkage and the actual amounts realized during the past three years have not been material 
revenue recognition 
the company retail operations segment recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns of merchandise 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision were not material for the years ended january   january  and january  the company share of income earned under the alliance with ge involving the dillard branded proprietary credit cards is included as a component of service charges and other income 
the company received income of approximately million  million and million from ge in fiscal  and  respectively 
pursuant to this alliance  the company has no continuing involvement other than to honor the proprietary cards in its stores 
although not obligated to a specific level of marketing commitment  the company participates in the marketing of the proprietary credit cards and accepts payments on the proprietary credit cards in its stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by paying online or mailing their payments to ge 
revenues from cdi construction contracts are generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each period to the total estimated revenue for the respective contracts 
the length of each contract varies but is typically nine to eighteen months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
any anticipated losses on completed contracts are recognized as soon as they are determined 
vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and margin maintenance programs 
cooperative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising  which could increase or decrease our expenditures 
similarly  we are not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenues for our stores 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
amounts of margin maintenance allowances are recorded only when an agreement has been reached with the vendor and the collection of the concession is deemed probable 
all such merchandise margin maintenance allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases 
under lifo rim  a 
table of contents portion of these allowances reduces cost of goods sold and a portion reduces the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
insurance accruals 
the company consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to claims for self insured workers compensation with a self insured retention of million per claim and general liability with a self insured retention of million per claim and a one time million corridor 
the company retentions are insured through a newly formed  wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
as of january  and january   insurance accruals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
adjustments resulting from changes in historical loss trends have helped control expenses during fiscal and  partially due to company programs that have helped decrease both the number and cost of claims 
further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for fiscal long lived assets 
the company judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  changes in store locations or tax planning  the company effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
the company classifies accrued interest expense and penalties relating to income tax in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense 
the total interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as of january   january  and january  was million  million  and million  
table of contents respectively 
the total accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
the company is currently being examined by the internal revenue service irs for the fiscal tax years through during fiscal  the irs completed its examination of the company federal income tax returns for the fiscal tax years through the company is also under examination by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for various fiscal years 
during fiscal  the company reached settlements with federal and state taxing jurisdictions which resulted in reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the tax years that remain subject to examination for major tax jurisdictions are fiscal tax years and forward  with the exception of fiscal through amended state and local tax returns related to the reporting of federal audit adjustments 
at this time  the company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
the company has taken positions in certain taxing jurisdictions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months 
the possible decrease could result from the finalization of the company federal and various state income tax audits 
the company federal income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to research and development credits  while various state income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to income from intangible assets 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible uncertain tax benefit decrease in the next twelve months is between million and million 
changes in the company assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
pension obligations 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup above median pension index curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate decreased to as of january  from as of january  we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the pension liability of million is appropriately stated as of january   however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a further basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the pension liability by approximately million 
the company expects to make a contribution to the pension plan of approximately million in fiscal the company expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal with a liability of million at january
