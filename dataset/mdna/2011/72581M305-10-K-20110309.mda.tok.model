we continually seek to expand our technology portfolio through internal development  co development with business partners and evaluation of acquisition opportunities 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  taiwan  china  korea  europe  southeast asia and the u 
s  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our korean and european sales 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries in which we operate  it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 
significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition financial  commercial and consumer markets experienced significant disruption during the last quarter of and throughout which adversely affected our results of operations during we responded to the 
table of contents economic downturn by initiating a restructuring plan in december to reduce our operating expenses by reducing operations  research and development and administrative headcount in our san jose  taiwan and china offices as well as implementing other cost reduction efforts  including company wide salary reductions during the second and third quarters of during the first three quarters of we experienced an increase in revenue as customer demand strengthened as a result of improvements in the world wide economy 
although the macroeconomic environment and our business appeared to have stabilized since early  in the fourth quarter of our revenue decreased due in part to inventory corrections by our customers as a result of weakening consumer demand 
additionally  consumer confidence and spending remain cautious and we are unable to predict how the challenging global economic environment may impact our future results of operations and financial position

net revenue increased million  or  from to the increase was attributable to a increase in units sold and a increase in average selling price asp 
the increase in units sold resulted primarily from increased sales of our new digital projector products  including increased sales in the dlp division of the digital projector market  as customer demand strengthened during as a result of improvements in the world wide economy 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of our motion estimation motion compensation memc co processor ics as we transitioned customers to our next generation memc co processor ics 
the increase in asp was primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of total revenue from the digital projector market  which generally has higher asps than our other products 
v 
net revenue decreased million  or  from to as the result of a decrease in units sold  partially offset by a increase in asp 
the decrease in units sold during compared to resulted primarily from weakened customer demand due to the worldwide economic downturn  particularly during the first half of decreased revenue also resulted from lower sales of our legacy products  including those we acquired in our acquisition of equator technologies  inc equator in june  and lower sales into markets which we no longer pursue 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our memc co processor ics  and our next generation projector image processors 
we did experience some recovery in revenue levels in the second half of compared to the first half of as the worldwide economy strengthened 
our most significant recovery was in digital projector market sales  which were up slightly from the second half of to the second half of  compared with a decrease of from the first half of to the first half of revenue from our advanced television market  which includes the panel market and our memc co processor ics  was approximately flat from the second half of to the second half of  an improvement over the decrease from the first half of to the first half of our revenue from other markets did not experience a recovery during the second half of  compared to the second half of  primarily due to consistent decreases in unit sales of legacy products in markets which we no longer pursue

total cost of revenue decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets that were fully amortized as of the second quarter of the decrease is partially offset by an increase in inventory charges as we transitioned customers to our next generation products 
direct product costs as a percentage of revenue remained flat in primarily due to favorable overhead cost absorption as a result of increased revenue without corresponding increases in our fixed costs  offset by a higher mix of our new products which have higher material costs than our legacy products 
we expect future cost improvements on our memc products and next generation projector processors as we continue to ramp production and realize production efficiencies  however  we are unable to predict the timing and extent of expected cost improvements 
v 
total cost of revenue increased to of revenue in from of revenue in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in direct product costs due to changes in the mix of products sold  including increased sales of our memc products and next generation projector processors and decreased sales of our legacy equator products 
gross profit margins also decreased due to the impact of lower overhead cost absorption due to decreased revenue without corresponding reductions in our fixed costs

these efforts resulted in the following reductions in research and development expenses depreciation and amortization expense  software maintenance expense and expensed equipment and software decreased million 
this decrease resulted from fewer engineering software tools due to changes in product development strategy as well as decreased amortization from certain licensed technology which became fully amortized during the first and second quarters of compensation expense decreased million as a result of a company wide salary reduction that was in effect during the second and third quarters of  a reduced senior management bonus for compared to  and continuous improvement in our engineering practices to lower costs and improve efficiency

benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was as follows in thousands year ended december  benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded tax contingencies due to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation  partially offset by current and deferred tax expense in profitable cost plus foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  is comprised of current and deferred tax expense in profitable foreign jurisdictions and accruals for tax contingencies in foreign jurisdictions  offset by a benefit of million for refundable research and experimentation credits and a benefit of million for the reversal of a previously recorded tax contingency due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
at december   we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against our us and canadian deferred tax assets as we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize those assets due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we did not record a valuation allowance against our other foreign deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from those assets

cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities total cash and marketable securities total cash and marketable securities decreased million from to the decrease resulted primarily from million in payments on property and equipment and other asset financing and million for purchases of property and equipment and other assets 
these decreases were partially offset by million generated by operating activities  million of realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities and a million non formula advance on our short term line of credit  as discussed below under capital resources 
excluding the non formula advance  our cash and marketable securities would have decreased million from to total cash and marketable securities decreased million from to the decrease resulted primarily from million used for the repurchase of long term debt  million in payments on property and equipment and other asset financing and million used for purchases of property and equipment and other long term assets 
the decreases were partially offset by million of positive cash flow from operations and a million increase in the valuation of our long term marketable security 
at december   cash equivalents and short term marketable securities included million in money market funds and certificates of deposit  million in us government agencies debt securities  million in commercial paper  and million in corporate debt securities 
at december   we also held a million long term strategic equity investment in a publicly traded corporation 
all of our investments were denominated in us dollars  and our portfolio did not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the quality of our short term investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment 
our investment policy requires that our portfolio maintains a weighted average maturity of less than months 

table of contents additionally  no maturities can extend beyond months and concentrations with individual securities are limited 
investments must be rated at least a p by standard poor s moody s  and our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our audit committee 
the valuations of our short term marketable securities are affected by a variety of factors  including changes in interest rates and the actual or perceived financial stability of the issuer 
however  due to the high quality of our investments and their short term nature  there has not been  and we do not expect there to be  a significant fluctuation in the valuation of these investments 
accordingly  we do not expect a materially negative impact on our financial condition from fluctuations in the value of our short term investments 
as of december   we had a nominal unrealized gain on these investments 
the valuation of our long term equity investment has fluctuated significantly and during the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary impairments of million  decreasing our cost basis from million to million as of december  during the year ended december   we sold million of our long term equity investment for gross proceeds of million and realized gains of million 
our remaining cost basis in the investment at december  was million

capital resources on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement the revolving loan agreement with silicon valley bank the bank 
the revolving loan agreement provides for a secured working capital based revolving line of credit the revolving line in an aggregate amount of up to the lesser of i million  or ii of eligible domestic accounts receivable and certain foreign accounts receivable 
in addition  the revolving loan agreement provides for non formula advances of up to million which may be made solely during the last five business days of any fiscal month or quarter and which must be repaid by the company on or before the fifth business day after the applicable fiscal month or quarter end 
due to their repayment terms  non formula advances do not provide the company with usable liquidity and are utilized by the company in order to maintain a million total asset value 
the revolving loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including with respect to the following compliance with laws  provision of financial statements and periodic reports  payment of taxes  maintenance of inventory and insurance  maintenance of operating accounts at the bank  the bank s access to collateral  formation or acquisition of subsidiaries  incurrence of indebtedness  dispositions of assets  granting liens  changes in business  ownership or business locations  engaging in mergers and acquisitions  making investments or distributions and affiliate transactions 
the covenants also require that the company maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying financial assets to the sum of qualifying financial obligations 
the revolving loan agreement also contains customary events of default  including the following defaults with respect to covenant compliance  the occurrence of a material adverse change  the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events  cross defaults  judgment defaults and material misrepresentations 
the 
table of contents occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the company s obligations under the revolving loan agreement and an increase to the applicable interest rate  and would permit the bank to exercise remedies with respect to its security interest 
to secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the revolving loan agreement  the company granted to the bank a security interest in substantially all of its assets  which assets do not include its intellectual property assets 
the company has agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber its intellectual property assets without prior written permission from the bank 
in  we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due in  we repurchased and retired million principal amount of the debentures 
in  we repurchased and retired million principal amount of the debentures for million in cash 
in  we repurchased and retired million principal amount of the debentures for million in cash  reducing the balance of our outstanding debentures to million 
we may redeem some or all of the outstanding debentures for cash on or after may  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of the debentures have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures outstanding at each of the following dates may   may   and may   at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the debentures are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt 
as of december   the debentures are classified as current liabilities as we expect the holders to require us to purchase all of the debentures on may  we intend to refinance or repurchase the debentures on or before may   which may consume a significant portion of our working capital  require the issuance of new debt on less favorable terms than our existing obligations or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock under a share repurchase program that expired in september total cumulative repurchases under the plan were million 
liquidity our cash and marketable securities totaling million  are highly liquid with scheduled maturities prior to may   the date we expect to be required to repurchase our debentures 
although the repayment of our debentures would consume a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities  we anticipate that our existing working capital  as well as funds available under our revolving line  will be adequate to fund our operating  investing and financing needs for the next twelve months 
if necessary  management will pursue financing arrangements including the issuance of debt or equity securities or will reduce expenditures  in order to meet the company s cash requirements 
there is no assurance that  if required  we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity which  in turn  may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
any further transactions  if consummated  may consume a material portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  property and 
table of contents equipment  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of investments  amortization of prepaid royalties  valuation of share based payments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we require customers to provide purchase orders prior to shipment and we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms 
these conditions are generally satisfied upon shipment of the underlying product 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific end customer and we subsequently lower the price to the end customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
the reserve for price protection  if required  is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our account by account risk analysis of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we record a reserve against our inventory for estimated obsolete  unmarketable  and otherwise impaired products by calculating the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we review our inventory at the end of each reporting period for valuation issues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the reserve was recorded  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
while we have concluded that the carrying value of our long lived assets is recoverable as of december   our analysis is dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows and our actual results may vary 
valuation of investments 
we apply judgment in determining whether our marketable securities are other than temporarily impaired 
when performing our evaluation  we consider the duration of the decline  future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of share based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
when there are changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of the share based payments  which results in variation in the compensation cost recognized 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we also regularly conduct a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheet 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years operating leases payments on accrued balances related to asset purchases estimated q purchase commitments to contract manufacturers other purchase obligations and commitments total the operating lease payments above are net of sublease rental income of million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations impact the interest income that we earn on our investment portfolio and the value of our investments 
factors that could cause interest rates to fluctuate include volatility in the credit and equity markets  such as the current uncertainty in global economic conditions  changes in the monetary policies of the united states and other countries and inflation 
we mitigate risks associated with such fluctuations  as well as the risk of loss of principal  by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of our investment portfolio 
during and as of december   substantially all of our cash equivalents and investments were held in high quality securities or money market funds with yields approaching zero  accordingly  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as of december   we had convertible subordinated debentures of million outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
interest rate changes affect the fair value of the debentures  but do not affect our earnings or cash flow 
exchange rate risk all of our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales or cost of goods sold 
we have employees located in offices in japan  taiwan  korea and the people s republic of china and as such  a portion of our operating expenses as well as foreign income taxes payable are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we analyze our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future
