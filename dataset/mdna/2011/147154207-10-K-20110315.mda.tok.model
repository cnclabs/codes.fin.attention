critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows reserve for credit losses the company s reserve for credit losses provides for estimated losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and related loan commitments 
arriving at an estimate of the appropriate level of reserve for credit losses reserve for loan losses and loan commitments involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in a methodology with relatively complex calculations and analysis 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses and considers qualitative factors including economic conditions and a range of other factors in its determination of the reserve 
on an ongoing basis  the company seeks to refine its methodology such that the reserve is at an appropriate level and responsive to changing conditions 
however  external factors and changing economic conditions may impact the portfolio and the level of reserves in ways currently unforeseen 

table of contents the reserve for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
the reserve for loan commitments is increased and decreased through non interest expense 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  see loan portfolio and credit quality later in this report 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the reserve for loans losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expenses 
deferred income taxes at december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million for a federal net operating loss carry forward which will expire in and a deferred tax asset of 
million for a federal tax credit which will expire at various dates from to at december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million for state net operating loss carry forwards which expire at various dates from to and a deferred tax asset of million for state tax credits which will expire at various dates from to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december  and was million and million respectively 
management determined that a valuation allowance was required at december  and by evaluating the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and available tax planning strategies 
the decrease in the valuation allowance and resulting benefit for deferred income taxes of  for the year ended december  was the result of expected future taxable income resulting from the gain on the retirement of the junior subordinated debentures in january the ability to utilize deferred tax assets is a complex process requiring in depth analysis of statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance and estimates of future taxable income 
the amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables 
federal income tax authorities have completed audits through the company has evaluated its income tax positions as of december  and based on this evaluation  the company has determined that it does not have any uncertain income tax positions for which an unrecognized tax liability should be recorded 
however in connection with the january  recapitalization of the company  future tax provisions may result in limitations as to the future timing and or deductibility of certain losses 
such regulations could result in future permanent impairment of net operating losses and or impairment of a substantial portion of the allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as interest expense and other noninterest expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company had no significant interest or penalties related to income tax matters during the years ended december   or economic conditions the company s business is closely tied to the economies of idaho and oregon in general and is particularly affected by the economies of central  southern and northwest oregon  as well as the greater boise  idaho area 
the uncertain depth and duration of the present economic downturn could continue to cause further deterioration of these local economies  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
real estate values in these areas have declined and may continue to fall 
unemployment rates in these areas have increased significantly and could increase further 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been impacted and local governments and many businesses are facing serious challenges due to the lack of consumer spending driven by elevated unemployment and uncertainty 
recently  the national and regional economies and real estate price depreciation have appeared to show signs of stabilization 
however  elevated unemployment and other indicators continue to suggest  as articulated by fed chairman bernake  that there remains unusual uncertainty as to the direction of the economy 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the declining value of collateral securing those loans  is 
table of contents reflective of the business environment in the markets where the company operates 
the present significant downturn in economic activity and declining real estate values has had a direct and adverse effect on the condition and results of operations of the company 
this is particularly evident in the residential land development and residential construction segments of the company s loan portfolio 
developers or home builders whose cash flows are dependent on the sale of lots or completed residences have reduced ability to service their loan obligations and the market value of underlying collateral has been and continues to be adversely affected 
the impact on the company has been an elevated level of impaired loans  an associated increase in provisioning expense and charge offs for the company leading to a net loss in and of million and million  respectively 
with stabilization of the economy during  the company s net loss was significantly lower at million  while credit quality improved with the level of impaired loans  charge offs and provisioning expense declining 
the local and regional economy also has a direct impact on the volume of bank deposits 
core deposits have declined since mid  because business and retail customers have experienced a reduction in cash available to deposit in the bank and have been affected by customer soundness concerns prior to our recapitalization 
financial highlights and summary of q and full year fourth quarter the company recorded net income of per share or million in the fourth quarter of  compared to a net loss of per share or million for the linked quarter and compared to a net loss of per share or million for the year ago quarter 
the quarterly net income primarily resulted from a tax benefit recorded in anticipation of the future realization of deferred tax assets based on projections of future taxable income related to the gain on the tps exchange 
additionally  net interest income is down for both the linked quarter and year ago period due to a reduction in average loans outstanding 
linked quarter credit metrics improved with npa s down along with reduced levels of classified and criticized assets 
the net interest margin for the quarter was compared to in the linked quarter primarily resulting from interest reversals on non performing loans compared to the prior quarter 
full year the company recorded a net loss of million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share for the annual loss was mainly due to credit losses and reduced net interest income primarily because of lower average loan yields and a decline in loans outstanding  which were partially offset by a tax benefit recorded in anticipation of the future realization of deferred tax assets based on projections of future taxable income related to gain on the tps exchange 
for  the company recorded a million provision for loan losses and million in oreo valuation and disposition costs and related expenses reflecting the adverse economic conditions effect on borrower s ability to repay loan obligations 
this compares with a million provision for loan losses and million in oreo costs in non interest income was down million in primarily due to a one time million gain recorded on the sale of the bank s credit card merchant business recorded in  coupled with a reduction in service charge income and mortgage banking income 
meanwhile  human resource costs and controllable discretionary non interest expenses decreased in compared to the prior year 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and net income loss the company recorded a net loss of million or per share in compared to a net loss of million or per share for and a net loss of million in or per share 
the loss in primarily resulted from a decrease in net interest income of million and a million loan loss provision 
the loss in primarily resulted from a decrease in net interest income of million  million loan loss provision  a valuation allowance of million against the company s deferred tax assets of million  and oreo expenses of million 
the loss in mainly resulted from the company s non cash impairment of goodwill in the amount of million  a million loan loss provision  as well as a decrease in net interest income of million 

table of contents net interest income net interest margin for most financial institutions  including the company  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned  principally from loans and investment securities portfolio  and interest paid  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income typically result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income decreased approximately million or for  and decreased approximately million or for due mainly to lower average earning assets and interest reversals and interest foregone on non performing loans 
in  interest income was down by million or as compared to primarily because of lower average yields  including interest reversed  and interest foregone on non performing loans 
total interest expense declined by approximately million or in mainly due to reduced volumes of interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
interest expense declined million or in as compared to primarily due to lower rates 
accordingly  net interest income decreased to million or in over net interest income decreased million or in over yields earned on assets decreased to for as compared to in and in meanwhile  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for decreased to compared to in and in the company s net interest margin nim increased to for compared to for the increase was mainly due to lower cost of funds 
the margin can also be affected by factors beyond market interest rates  including loan or deposit volume shifts and or aggressive rate offerings by competitor institutions 
the company s financial model indicates a relatively stable interest rate risk profile within a reasonable range of rate movements around the forward rates currently predicted by financial markets 

table of contents components of net interest margin nim the following table presents further analysis of the components of cascade s nim and sets forth for   and information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant average yields or rates  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities for the company

the company s adverse trend in non performing assets peaked in early  and  since that time both the frequency and severity of charge offs has abated somewhat 
the bank has maintained pooled and impaired loan reserves with additional consideration of qualitative factors and unallocated reserves in reaching its determination of the total reserve for credit losses 
the level of reserves is subject to review by the bank s regulatory authorities who may require adjustments to the reserve based on their evaluation and opinion of economic and industry factors as well as specific loans in the portfolio 
for further discussion  see critical accounting policies reserve for credit losses and loan portfolio and credit quality elsewhere in this form k annual report 
there can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan related losses 
non interest income non interest income decreased in compared to however  included a one time gain on the sale of business merchant services of million  when adjusted to remove this one time gain  the decrease in noninterest income for was 
the adjusted decrease was generally a function of slowing economic activity affecting service charge revenue  net mortgage revenue and a decrease in card issuer and merchant services fees 
service charges were down million primarily due to less usage of overdraft protection while net mortgage revenue was down million for the year due to a decrease in mortgage originations of compared to see explanation below under mortgage banking income 

table of contents total non interest income decreased in compared to after excluding the one time gain of million on the sale of the merchant card processing business in  with service charges on deposit accounts down million  card issuer and merchant service fees down million and earnings on bank owned life insurance down million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in mortgage banking income  gains on sales of investment securities available for sale and other income 
mortgage banking income home mortgage originations and mortgage related revenue residential mortgage originations totaled million in  down when compared to million in related net mortgage banking income was million in  a decrease of compared to million for the previous year  and was million in lower volume and revenue in relate mainly to the effects of termination of the company s eligibility to sell mortgage originations direct to fnma 
with the january capital raise  we are in process of reinstating such eligibility 
the general level and direction of interest rates directly influence the volume and profitability of the yield curve in mortgage banking 
a lower interest rate climate continued in and which had the effect of decreasing the profitability of mortgage banking due to a lower interest rate yield curve 
in april  the bank sold its msrs  discontinued directly servicing mortgage loans it originates  and now sells originations servicing released 
servicing released means that whoever the bank sells the loan to will service or arrange for servicing of the loan 
in connection with the sale of the bank s msr s  the bank entered into an agreement with fnma under the terms of which management believes that the bank will have no further recourse liability or obligation to fnma in connection with the bank s original mortgage sales and servicing agreement with fnma or any other recourse obligations to fnma 
the bank recorded a loss on the sale of msrs of approximately  and it is included in other expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in february  the company received a letter from fnma stating that effective immediately  the bank status as a fannie mae seller servicer will now be considered approved 
msrs are included in accrued interest and other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  msrs were carried at the lower of origination value less accumulated amortization  or current fair value 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s msrs was approximately million  and the net carrying value of msrs was million 
non interest expenses non interest expenses for decreased to million as compared to million in  primarily due to a reduction in salaries and employee benefits expense of and lower costs and valuation adjustments to oreo in after adjusting for the non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in  non interest expense for increased million or due to higher oreo related costs  fdic insurance  and other professional services  partially offset by a reduction in salaries and employee benefits expense 
oreo expenses were down million to million in compared to in primarily due to decreased valuation adjustments 
oreo costs and valuation adjustments increased million for compared to  primarily due to depressed real estate values on foreclosed land development properties 
in addition  fdic deposit insurance assessments increased million or in when compared to  reflecting the fdic s higher base assessment rate for and expenses related to the fdic s industry wide emergency special assessment in the second quarter of professional fees increased million or which includes legal  accounting and other professional services in connection with the company s efforts in its public capital raise efforts in the fourth quarter of meanwhile  the company continued to experience a reduction in salary expenses  and employee benefits expenses declined as staffing continued to be trimmed in response to the slowing economy  and no executive bonuses were paid in  or 
table of contents income taxes as of december   the company maintained a valuation allowance of million against the gross deferred tax asset balance of million  for a net deferred tax asset of million 
this increase in gross deferred tax assets from year end is primarily due to an increase in state net operating loss carry forwards 
during  the company recorded a credit for deferred income taxes of million  primarily as a result of a decrease in the valuation allowance due to the expected future taxable income resulting from the gain on the retirement of the company s junior subordinated debentures in january as of december   the company had recorded refundable income taxes receivable of approximately million related to the carryback of operating losses to prior years and had provided a million charge to create a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets

financial condition balance sheet overview at december   total assets were down to billion compared to december  cash and cash equivalents were million or of total assets at december  compared to a million or at december  total loans have been reduced by million to billion at december  compared to billion at december  loans have declined primarily due to loan payoffs  reduced demand owing to economic contraction  and management s strategic loan reduction program which has resulted in lower loan portfolio risk exposure and helped to support regulatory capital ratios 
a portion of the reduction in loan balances was the result of net loan charge offs of million for total deposits decreased compared to core deposits have trended down due to the ongoing effects of an adverse economy on our customers and local markets 
in addition  customers were affected by soundness concerns prior to our recapitalization mainly related to brokered  public  and non insured customer deposits

the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether any securities are other than temporarily impaired 
the company did not invest in securities backed by sub prime mortgages and believes its investment portfolio has negligible exposure to such risk at this date

loan portfolio and credit quality loan portfolio composition 
net loans represented approximately of total assets as of december  the company makes substantially all of its loans to customers located within the company s service areas 
as a result of the economic conditions and characteristics of the company s primary markets  including among others  the historical rapid growth in population and the nature of the tourism and service industry found in much of its market areas  cascade s loan portfolio has historically been concentrated in real estate related loans 
the company is presently working to reduce its construction lot portfolio in response to the challenging real estate economy 
however  achieving significant reduction could prove problematic without some improvement in economic conditions and market liquidity as well as in pricing of related real estate assets 
because of the nature of its markets  real estate lending is expected to continue as a major concentration within the loan portfolio 
the company has no significant agricultural loans

table of contents real estate loan concentration risk 
real estate loans have historically represented a significant portion of the company s overall loan portfolio and real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
approximately two thirds of total loans have exposure to real estate  including construction and lot loans comprised of land development plus residential and commercial construction loan types  commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  and consumer real estate 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  demand and prices for housing or commercial properties  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and concentration within the bank s market area 
the following paragraphs provide information on portions of the company s real estate loan portfolio  specifically construction lot and commercial real estate 
all such lending activities are subject to the varied risks of real estate lending 
the company s loan origination process requires specialized underwriting  collateral and approval procedures  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk that loans may not be repaid 
note that the minor balance differences between the preceding and following tables are a result of the inclusion of net deferred loan fees in the above tables 
a residential land development category 
this category is included in the construction lot portfolio balances above  and represents loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots 
such loans typically finance land purchase and infrastructure development of properties ie roads  utilities  etc 
with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sale to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units 
the primary source of repayment of such loans is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land while real estate collateral  secondary sources and personal guarantees may provide an additional measure of security for such loans 
the nationwide downturn in real estate has continued to slow down lot and home sales within the company s markets 
this has adversely impacted certain developers by lengthening the marketing period of their projects and negatively affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values 
weakness in this category of loans has contributed significantly to the elevated level of provision for loan losses in and the situation continues to be closely monitored and an elevated level of provisioning may be required should deterioration continue

obligors may be the business owner occupier of the building who intends to operate its business from the property upon construction  or non owner speculative developers 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase 
in certain circumstances  the company may provide or commit to take out financing upon construction 
take out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines 
while our portfolios of these types of loans have not experienced the severe credit quality challenges experienced in residential construction projects  there can be no assurance that the credit quality in these portfolios will not be impacted should present challenging economic conditions persist 
no assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the estimates that are currently included in the reserve for credit losses  which could adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

cre loans represent approximately of total loans outstanding as of december  approximately of cre loans are made to owner occupied users of the commercial property  while of cre loans are to obligors who do not directly occupy the property 
management believes that lending to owner occupied businesses may mitigate  but not eliminate  commercial real estate risk 
the average loan in the cre portfolio is only about million and of balances are represented in loans under million 
this granular and well diversified portfolio has maintained low delinquency and only modest deterioration in the present downturn

ongoing loan portfolio monitoring is performed by a centralized credit administration function including review and testing of compliance to loan policies and procedures 
internal and external auditors and bank regulatory examiners periodically sample and test certain credit files as well 
risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  which could result in the classification of such loans as non performing 
certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
reserve for credit losses 
the reserve for credit losses reserve for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments represents management s recognition of the assumed and present risks of extending credit and the possible inability or failure of the obligors to make repayment 
the reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses on loans and unfunded commitments based on management s current assessment of a variety of current factors affecting the loan portfolio 
such factors include loss experience  review of problem loans  current economic conditions  and an overall evaluation of the quality  risk characteristics and concentration of loans in the portfolio 
the level of reserve for credit losses is also subject to review by the bank regulatory authorities who may require increases to the reserve based on their evaluation of the information available to it at the time of its examination of the bank 
the reserve is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
see income statement overview loan loss provision above 

table of contents the following describes the company s methodology for assessing the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses 
for this purpose  loans and related commitments to loan are analyzed and reserves are categorized into the pooled reserve  specifically identified reserves for impaired loans  the unallocated reserve  or the reserve for unfunded loan commitments 
the pooled reserve for commercial and consumer loan segments is calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loan balances  segregated by common risk attributes 
at december   loss factors are based on historical loss experience calculated on a rolling twelve quarter basis  then weighted for the most current four quarters  for the next four preceding quarters  and for the final four preceding quarters 
these historical loss factors are then adjusted based on qualitative factors for current economic trends  levels and trends of loan performance  and other risk management trends affecting the portfolio and or portfolio segments 
certain qualitative factors adjust model results for economic and portfolio performance trends are based upon management s evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the historical loss factors 
such factors include uncertainties in economic conditions  uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates  internal and external risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors  and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
impaired loans are either specifically allocated for in the reserve for loan losses or reflected as a partial charge off of the loan balance 
the bank considers loans to be impaired when management believes that it is probable that either principal and or interest amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral or related guaranty 
since a significant portion of the bank s loans are collateralized by real estate  the bank primarily measures impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral or related guaranty 
in certain other cases  impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
impairment measurements may also include consideration of information that became available subsequent to year end 
small balance loans are reserved for based on the loan segment they fall under  and receive the pool reserve rate regardless of dollar amount 
generally shortfalls on impaired small balance loans will be charged off and the bank would not establish specific reserves 
small balance loans are evaluated for impairment based on borrower s difficulty in making payments  analysis of the borrower s repayment capacity  collateral coverage and shortfall  if any  created by reductions in payments or principal 
generally  the bank evaluates a loan for impairment when a loan is determined to be adversely classified  small balance loans are monitored based on payment performance and are evaluated for impairment no later than days past due 
the reserve for loan losses may include an unallocated amount based upon the company s judgment as to possible credit losses inherent in the portfolio that may not have been captured by historical loss experience  qualitative factors  or specific evaluations of impaired loans 
unallocated reserves would generally comprise less than of the total base reserve and may be adjusted for factors including  but not limited to  unexpected events  volatile market and economic conditions  regulatory guidance and recommendations  or other factors that may impact operating conditions and loss expectations 
management s judgment as to unallocated reserves is determined in the context of  but separate from  the historical loss trends and qualitative factors described above 
prior to december   loss factors were generally determined by considering loss experience over a five year period and adjusted for prospective loss potential 
also prior to december   in certain circumstances with respect to adversely risk rated loans  pooled reserves were allocated for groupings of loans through the use of loss factors utilizing information as to estimated collateral values  secondary sources of repayment  guarantees and other relevant factors  including consideration of information that became available subsequent to year end 
the bank s ratio of reserve for credit losses to total loans was at december  compared to at december  and at december  at this date  management believes that the company s reserve is at an appropriate level under current circumstances and prevailing economic conditions 

table of contents the total amount of actual loan losses may vary significantly from the estimated amount 
no assurance can be given that in any particular period  the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient  or that loan losses will not be sustained that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that changing economic factors or other environmental conditions could cause increases in the loan loss provision 
the company classifies reserves for unfunded commitments as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
such reserves are included as part of the overall reserve for credit losses 
reserves for unfunded commitments totaled approximately 
million and 
million at december  and  respectively 
allocation of reserve for credit losses 
the higher reserve for loan losses in recent years is attributable to the affect the adverse economy has had on obligor s ability to repay loans 
the unallocated portion of the reserve reflects the level of uncertainty as to the future direction and severity of the economic environment 
prior to december  the level of unallocated reserves included amounts now captured in the current methodology through certain loss factors and qualitative considerations 
while a combination of evidence demonstrating greater clarity on construction lot exposure and reduced exposure levels has lessened concern in this loan portfolio  risk in other asset categories continues 
typical factors leading to changes in reserve allocation include changes in debt service coverage ratios  guarantor and or collateral valuation as well as economic conditions that may have a specific or generalized impact on the relative risks inherent in various loan portfolios 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate  the total reserve for loan losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
the following table allocates the reserve for credit losses among major loan types

december  dollars in thousands commercial     real estate construction lot     commercial     consumer other  total non performing assets    the accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when  in management s judgment  the future collectability of principal or interest is in doubt 
loans placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time of such determination  and may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse  and charge against current income  interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest subsequently collected on such loans is credited to loan principal if  in the opinion of management  full collectability of principal is doubtful 
interest income that was reversed and charged against income was million in  million in and million in during our normal loan review procedures  a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are currently measured at lower of cost or fair value 
certain large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  collectively measured for impairment  are excluded 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
in addition  net overdraft losses are included in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses per the guidance provided by regulatory authorities early in  in joint guidance on overdraft protection programs 
at december   the company s recorded investment in certain loans that were considered to be impaired was million and specific valuation allowances were million 
impaired loans were million with specific valuation allowances of million at year end

the company owns both general account and separate account boli 
the separate account boli was purchased the fourth quarter of as an investment expected to provide a long term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit plans 
the fair value of the general account boli is based on the insurance contract cash surrender value 
the cash surrender value of the separate account boli is the quoted market price of the underlying securities  further supported by a stable value wrap  which mitigates  but may not fully insulate investment against changes in the fair market value depending on severity and duration of possible market price disruption

at december   the company did not have any wholesale brokered deposits compared to a total of million at december  the internet listing service deposits at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
such deposits are sourced by posting time deposit rates on an internet site where institutions seeking to deploy funds contact the bank directly to open a deposit account 
in addition  local relationship based reciprocal cdars deposits totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
however  banks that are not well capitalized are restricted from accessing wholesale brokered deposits 
further  the order restricts the bank s ability to accept additional brokered deposits  including the bank s reciprocal cdar s program  for which it previously had a temporary waiver from the fdic

capital resources federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure of capital deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulator for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
at december   the company does not meet the regulatory benchmarks for adequately capitalized institutions 
as mentioned earlier in this report the bank is operating under a regulatory order 
at december   the company s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  and the bank s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  which do not meet regulatory benchmarks for adequately capitalized 
regulatory benchmarks for an adequately capitalized designation are  and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively  well capitalized benchmarks are   and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively 
however  as mentioned elsewhere in this report  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
additional information regarding capital resources are located in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures to improve its capital position  maintain liquidity ratios  reduce its level of non performing assets  reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios  improve management practices and board supervision and to assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level 
at december  the bank was unable to implement certain measures in the time frame provided  particularly those related to raising capital levels 
however  as a result of the closing of the capital raise on january   the bank s pro forma capital ratios are in excess of those required for a well capitalized institution as well as those required under the order 

table of contents from time to time the company makes commitments to acquire banking properties or to make equipment or technology related investments of capital 
at december   the company had no material capital expenditure commitments apart from those incurred in the ordinary course of business 
liquidity and sources of funds the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
to build contingent liquidity in response to challenging market conditions  the bank has worked to stabilize and retain local deposits  accessed internet listing service deposits  and reduced its loan balances 
at december   liquid assets of the bank are mainly interest bearing balances held at frb totaling million compared to million at december  because of the economic downturn  the condition of the bank and other uncertainties no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity 
core relationship deposits are the bank s primary source of funds 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
the company views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
the bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts  and a lesser percentage in time deposits 
the bank augments core deposits with wholesale funds 
the bank is currently restricted under the terms of the order from accepting or renewing brokered deposits 
at december   the company did not have any brokered deposits compared to million at december  local relationship based reciprocal cdars deposits which are also technically classified as brokered deposits totaled million at december   down from million at december  at december   internet sourced deposits were approximately million compared to million at year end such deposits are sourced by posting time deposit rates on an internet site where institutions seeking to deploy funds contact the bank directly to open a deposit account 
on april   the bank received notification from the oregon state treasury that the oregon revised statutes established a maximum aggregate balance of of the bank s net worth for oregon public fund deposits for banks whose regulatory capital ratios are less than that required to be categorized adequately capitalized 
the statute does not require divestiture but restricts a bank in this circumstance from accepting additional public funds where such deposit would cause aggregate balances to exceed 
on september   the bank received notification from the oregon state treasury that it had failed to comply with the statute within the day period provided 
therefore  the bank was required to reduce its aggregate oregon public fund balances to a level below of the bank s net worth by october  accordingly  the bank reduced its aggregate oregon public fund balances to a level below of the bank s net worth on october   achieving compliance with the statute 
the bank will continue to accept public deposits and operate in compliance with this statute 
under the order  the bank is restricted from having uninsured public deposits in idaho 
the bank also utilizes borrowings and lines of credit as sources of funds 
at december   the fhlb had extended the bank a secured line of credit of million of total assets accessible for short or long term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral 
as of december   the bank had qualifying collateral pledged for fhlb borrowings totaling million which was largely utilized by approximately million in secured borrowings and million fhlb letter of credit used for collateralization of oregon public deposits held by the bank 
at december   the bank also had undrawn borrowing capacity at frb of approximately supported by specific qualifying collateral 
borrowing capacity from fhlb or frb may fluctuate based upon the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
also  frb or fhlb could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings 
as with many community banks  correspondent banks have withdrawn unsecured lines of credit or now require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds on a short term basis due to the present adverse economic environment 

table of contents in  tlgp was established under which the fdic would temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior debt of fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
on february  the bank issued million of notes under the tlgp 
the issuance included million floating rate and million fixed rate notes maturing february  liquidity may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
at december   the bank had approximately million in outstanding commitments to extend credit  compared to approximately million at year end at this time  management believes that the bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business 
the investment portfolio also provides a secondary source of funds as investments may be pledged for borrowings or sold for cash 
this liquidity is limited  however  by counterparties willingness to accept securities as collateral and the market value of securities at the time of sale could result in a loss to the bank 
as of december   unpledged investments totaled approximately million 
bancorp is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is dividends received from the bank 
such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank 
banking regulations and authorities may limit the amount or require certain approvals of the dividend that the bank may pay to bancorp 
pursuant to the order  the bank is required to seek permission from its regulators prior to payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
the company cut its dividend to zero in the fourth quarter of we do not expect the bank to pay dividends to bancorp for the foreseeable future 
bancorp is unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it pays all accrued payments on its trust preferred securities 
payment of dividends is also restricted by state and federal regulators see note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
as of december   bancorp had million of tps outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
the company elected to defer payments on its tps beginning in the second quarter of and as of december   accrued dividends were million 
bancorp does not expect to pay any dividend for the foreseeable future 
inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices  therefore  the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses 
in january  the company exchanged its trust preferred securities for senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million representing of the original balance of the trust preferred securities 
following the capital raise the notes were extinguished for cash and liability for trust preferred securities debt was fully extinguished

interest rate risk management the goal of the company s risk management policy is to maximize long term profitability and minimize earnings volatility under the range of likely interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk management requires estimating the probability and impact of changes in interest rates on assets and liabilities 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
management hires and engages a qualified independent service provider to assist in modeling  monthly reporting and assessing interest rate risk 
the company s methodology for analyzing interest rate risk includes income simulation modeling as well as traditional interest rate gap analysis 
while both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates  it is management s opinion that simulation is the more effective tool for asset and liability management 
the bank has historically adjusted its sensitivity to changing interest rates by strategically 
table of contents managing its loan and deposit portfolios with respect to pricing  maturity or contractual characteristics 
the bank may also target the expansion or contraction of specific investment portfolio or borrowing structures to further affect its risk profile 
in addition  the bank is authorized to enter into interest rate swap or other hedging contracts with re pricing characteristics that tend to moderate interest rate risk 
however  there are no material structured hedging instruments in use at this time 
because of the volatility of market rates  event risk and other uncertainties described below  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve its interest rate risk objectives 
to assess and estimate the degree of interest rate risk  the company utilizes a sophisticated simulation model that estimates the possible volatility of company earnings resulting from changes in interest rates 
management first establishes a wide range of possible interest rate scenarios over a two year forecast period 
such scenarios routinely include a stable or unchanged scenario and an estimated or most likely scenario given current and forecast economic conditions 
in addition  scenarios titled rising rates  declining rates  and alternate rising rates are established to stress test the impact of more dramatic rate movements that are perceived as less likely  but may still possibly occur 
next  net interest income and net income are simulated in each scenario 
note that earnings projections include the effect of estimated loan and deposit growth that management deems reasonable  however  such volume projections are not varied by rate scenario 
note also that the downturn in real estate has caused elevated levels of non performing loans which lower estimated nim depending on the absolute volume of such assets 
simulated earnings are compared over a two year time horizon 
the following table defines the market interest rates projected in various interest rate scenarios 
generally  projected market rates are reached gradually over the year simulation horizon

estimated rate scenario compared to 
graphic missing 
first twelve month average change in pro forma net interest income second twelve month average change in pro forma net interest income th month annualized change in pro forma net interest income declining rate scenario alternate rising rate scenario rising rate scenario management s assessment of interest rate risk and scenario analysis must be considered in the context of market interest rates and overall economic conditions 
the federal reserve is holding short term rates low in an effort to stimulate economic growth 
the yield curve is unusually steep as a result 
rates are expected to rise toward the end of as the fed reduces the excess liquidity in the monetary system 
in management s judgment and at this date  the interest rate risk profile of the bank is reasonably balanced within the most likely range of possible outcomes 
the model indicates that should future interest rates actually follow the path indicated in the estimated rate scenario  the net interest margin would range between and over the next months 
however  with the more dramatic changes reflected in the rising or declining scenarios  the model suggests the margin would likely fall outside of this range should such interest rates actually occur 
this is mainly because the bank has a large portion of non interest bearing funds approximately of total deposits that are assumed to be relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates 
thus in the event of rising rates  yields on earning assets would tend to increase at a faster pace than overall cost of funds  leading to an improving margin 
conversely  should rates fall to the low levels assumed in the declining scenario  yields on loans and securities would compress against an already low cost of funds 
also in this declining rate scenario  the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate on 
table of contents loans currently outstanding that would refinance to lower rates  contributing to margin compression 
thus in the declining rate scenario where the federal fund rates fall to just  the model indicates that the net interest margin could be or less during the first months of the forecast horizon  and below during the second twelve months 
management has concluded that the degree of margin and earnings volatility under the above scenarios is acceptable because of the cost of mitigating such risk and because the model suggests that the bank would still generate satisfactory net interest margin under such circumstances 
please carefully review and consider the following information regarding the risk of placing undue reliance on simulation models  interest rate projections and scenario results 
in all scenarios discussed above  results are modeled using management s estimates as to growth in loans  deposits and other balance sheet items  as well as the expected mix and pricing thereof 
these volume estimates are static in the various scenarios 
such estimates may be inaccurate as to future periods 
model results are only indicative of interest rate risk exposure under various scenarios 
the results do not encompass all possible paths of future market rates  in terms of absolute change or rate of change  or changes in the shape of the yield curve 
nor does the simulation anticipate changes in credit conditions that could affect results 
likewise  scenarios do not include possible changes in volumes  pricing or portfolio management tactics that may enable management to moderate the effect of such interest rate changes 
simulations are dependent on assumptions and estimations that management believes are reasonable  although the actual results may vary substantially  and there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of future earnings under such conditions 
this is  in part  because of the nature and uncertainties inherent in simulating future events including no presumption of changes in asset and liability strategies in response to changing circumstances  model assumptions may differ from actual outcomes  uncertainties as to customer behavior in response to changing circumstances  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit volume changes  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  unexpected behavior by competitors  and other unanticipated credit conditions or other events impacting volatility in market conditions and interest rates 
interest rate gap table in the opinion of management  the use of interest rate gap analysis is less valuable than the simulation method discussed above as a means to measure and manage interest rate risk 
this is because it is a static measure of rate sensitivity and does not capture the possible magnitude or pace of rate changes 
at year end  the company s one year cumulative interest rate gap analysis indicates that rate sensitive liabilities maturing or available for re pricing within one year exceeded rate sensitive assets by approximately million
