overview we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a bdc 
our investment objective is to generate current income and  to a lesser extent  capital appreciation from our investments 
we invest primarily in leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private us middle market companies  both through direct lending and through participation in loan syndicates 
we may also invest up to of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders 
such investments may include investments in distressed debt  which may include securities of companies in bankruptcy  foreign debt  private equity  securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds

corporate history and recent developments we commenced operations  at the time known as gsc investment corp  on march  and completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock on march  prior to july   we were externally managed and advised by gscp nj  lp  an entity affiliated with gsc group  inc in connection with the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on july   we engaged saratoga investment advisors to replace gscp nj  lp as our investment adviser and changed our name to saratoga investment corp 
the recapitalization transaction was necessitated by the fact that we had exceeded permissible borrowing limits under our revolving securitized credit facility with deutsche bank ag  new york branch in july  which resulted in an event of default under the revolving securitized credit facility 
as a result of the event of default under the revolving securitized credit facility  deutsche bank had the right to accelerate repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving securitized credit facility and to foreclose and liquidate the collateral pledged thereunder 
as a result of the event of default  the auditors of gsc investment corp 
now known as saratoga investment corp 
included in their audit report dated may  that there was substantial doubt about gsc investment corp 
s ability to continue as a going concern 
in light of the event of default under the revolving securitized credit facility  we engaged the investment banking firm of stifel  nicolaus company to evaluate strategic transaction opportunities and consider alternatives for us in december on april   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with saratoga investment advisors and certain of its affiliates and an assignment  assumption and novation agreement with saratoga investment advisors  pursuant to which we assumed certain rights and obligations of saratoga investment advisors under a debt commitment letter saratoga investment advisors received from madison capital funding llc  indicating madison capital funding willingness to provide us with a million senior secured revolving credit facility  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
in addition  we and gscp nj  lp entered into a termination and release agreement  to be effective as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement  pursuant to which gscp nj  lp  among other things  agreed to waive any and all accrued and unpaid deferred incentive management fees up to and as of the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement but continued to be entitled to receive the base management fees

we used the net proceeds from the private sale transaction and a portion of the funds available to us under the million senior secured revolving credit facility with madison capital funding to pay the full amount of principal and accrued interest  including default interest  outstanding under our revolving securitized credit facility with deutsche bank 
the revolving securitized credit facility with deutsche bank was terminated in connection with our payment of all amounts outstanding thereunder on july  on august   we effected a one for ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of the reverse stock split  every ten shares of our common stock were converted into one share of our common stock 
any fractional shares received as a result of the reverse stock split were redeemed for cash 
the total cash payment in lieu of shares was immediately after the reverse stock split  we had  shares of our common stock outstanding 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains  if any  on equity interests that we may acquire 
we expect our debt investments  whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt  to have terms of up to 
table of contents ten years  and to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate 
interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi annually 
in some cases  our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest to be paid in kind pik 
to the extent interest is paid in kind  it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation 
the principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned 
we may also invest in preferred equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis 
pursuant to an agreement with our former investment adviser  gscp nj  lp  entered into on october   prior to becoming a bdc  we acquired the right to act as investment adviser to gsc partners cdo fund iii limited  a collateralized debt obligation fund which we refer to as cdo fund iii  and collect the management fees related thereto from march  until the liquidation of the cdo fund iii assets 
we paid gscp nj  lp a fair market price of million for the right to act as investment adviser to cdo fund iii 
on january   we entered into a collateral management agreement with gsc investment corp 
clo ltd  a collateralized loan obligation fund which we refer to as gscic clo  pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager and receive a senior collateral management fee of and a subordinate collateral management fee of of the outstanding principal amount of gscic clo assets  paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds 
we are also entitled to an incentive management fee equal to of excess cash flow to the extent the gscic clo subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return equal to or greater than 
we recognize interest income on our investment in the subordinated notes of gscic clo using the effective interest method  based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment 
yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and or re investments  credit losses or asset pricing 
changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of investment advisory and management fees  professional fees  directors and officers insurance  fees paid to independent directors and administrator expenses  including our allocable portion of our administrator overhead 
our investment advisory and management fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to organization  calculating our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  expenses incurred by our investment adviser payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisers  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  investment advisory and management fees  
table of contents fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisers  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  federal and state registration fees  all costs of registration and listing our common stock on any securities exchange  federal  state and local taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies including the sec  costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to common stockholders including printing costs  our fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  direct costs and expenses of administration  including printing  mailing  long distance telephone  copying  secretarial and other staff  independent auditors and outside legal costs  and administration fees and all other expenses incurred by us or  if applicable  the administrator in connection with administering our business including payments under the administration agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator overhead in performing its obligations under an administration agreement  including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs including travel expenses 
pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement that we had with gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser and administrator  we had agreed to pay gscp nj  lp as investment adviser a quarterly base management fee of of the average value of our total assets other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters  and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable fiscal quarter  and an incentive fee 
the incentive fee had two parts a fee  payable quarterly in arrears  equal to of our pre incentive fee net investment income  expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter  that exceeded a quarterly annualized hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
under this provision  in any fiscal quarter  our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 
amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee 
since the hurdle rate was based on net assets  a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee 
a fee  payable at the end of each fiscal year  equal to of our net realized capital gains  if any  computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation  in each case on a cumulative basis  less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date 
we deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if  during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made  the sum of a our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and b our change in net assets defined as total assets less liabilities before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period was less than of our net assets at the beginning of such period 
these 
table of contents calculations were appropriately pro rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period 
such incentive fee would become payable on the next date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory and management agreement 
we commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended august   and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended may  as of july   the date on which gscp nj  lp ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator  we owed gscp nj  lp million in fees for services previously provided to us  of which million has been paid by us 
gscp nj  lp agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining million in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with saratoga investment advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere in this prospectus 
the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement with saratoga investment advisors  our current investment adviser  are substantially similar to the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement we had entered into with gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser  except for the following material distinctions in the fee terms the capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from may   and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to saratoga investment advisors and  as a result  saratoga investment advisors will be entitled to of net gains that arise after may  in addition  the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of may  equal the fair value of such investment as of such date 
under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser  gscp nj  lp  the capital gains fee was calculated from march   and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses 
under the catch up provision  of our pre incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre incentive fee net investment income that exceeds annualized but is less than or equal to in any fiscal quarter is payable to saratoga investment advisors 
this will enable saratoga investment advisors to receive of all net investment income as such amount approaches in any quarter  and saratoga investment advisors will receive of any additional net investment income 
under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser  gscp nj  lp only received of the excess net investment income over 
we will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than for the preceding four fiscal quarters 
to the extent that any of our leveraged loans are denominated in a currency other than us dollars  we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements 
such hedging activities  which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements  may include the use of interest rate caps  futures  options and forward contracts 
costs incurred in entering into or settling such contracts will be borne by us 
from the commencement of operations until march   gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser and administrator  was reimbursed by us for providing us administrative services for operating expenses to the extent that our total annual operating expenses other than investment advisory and management fees and interest and credit facility expenses exceeded an amount equal to of our net assets attributable to common stock 
subsequently  the amount payable to gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser and administrator  as administrator was capped to the effect that such amount  together with our other operating expenses  could not exceed an amount equal to per annum of our net assets attributable to common stock 
in addition  for the one year term of the administration agreement expiring on march   gscp nj  lp had agreed to waive our reimbursement obligation under the administration agreement until our total assets exceeded million

our asset coverage ratio  as defined in the act  was  and for the years ended february  and  respectively 

table of contents at february  and  the fair value of investments  cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents  securitization accounts were as follows at february  at february  fair value percent of total fair value percent of total in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  securitization accounts first lien term loans second lien term loans senior secured notes unsecured notes structured finance securities common stock total on november   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share to shareholders payable in cash or shares of our common stock  in accordance with the provisions of the irs revenue procedure  which allows a publicly traded regulated investment company to satisfy its distribution requirements with a distribution paid partly in common stock provided that at least of the distribution is payable in cash 
the dividend was paid on december  to common shareholders of record on november  based on shareholder elections  the dividend consisted of million in cash and  shares of common stock  or of our outstanding common stock prior to the dividend payment 
the amount of cash elected to be received was greater than the cash limit of of the aggregate dividend amount  thus resulting in the payment of a combination of cash and stock to shareholders who elected to receive cash 
the number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on a price of per share  which equaled the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on december  and  on november   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share payable on december   to common stockholders of record on november  shareholders had the option to receive payment of the dividend in cash  shares of common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  provided that the aggregate cash payable to all shareholders was limited to million or per share 
based on shareholder elections  the dividend consisted of million in cash and  shares of common stock  or of our outstanding common stock prior to the dividend payment 
the amount of cash elected to be received was greater than the cash limit of of the aggregate dividend amount  thus resulting in the payment of a combination of cash and stock to shareholders who elected to receive cash 
the number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on a price of per share  which equaled the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on december and  given the size of our asset base and our growing pipeline of attractive investments  our board of directors believes that using our capital resources to build and diversify our portfolio serves stockholders interests best by better positioning us to generate current income and capital appreciation on an increasing scale in future periods 
therefore  our board of directors has determined not to pay any dividends at this time 

table of contents we intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations  including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less  future borrowings and future offerings of securities 
our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings  including our dividend reinvestment plan  and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings  to the extent permitted by the act  our plans to raise capital may not be successful 
in this regard  because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
in addition  we intend to distribute between and of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to rics under subchapter m of the code 
consequently  we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments  to make additional investments in our portfolio companies  to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings 
in addition  the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and  if we are required to sell these investments  we may realize significantly less than their recorded value 
also  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets  less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future  we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources  including the equity markets and other debt related markets  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt and other contractual obligations at february  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations off balance sheet arrangements at february  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of market risk 
we consider our principal market risks to be fluctuations in interest rates 
managing this risk is essential to our business 
accordingly  we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks  to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes 

table of contents interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  including relative changes in different interest rates  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire leveraged loans  high yield bonds and other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio 
our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and the prime rate 
a large portion of our portfolio is  and we expect will continue to be  comprised of floating rate investments that utilize libor 
our interest expense is affected by fluctuations in libor 
at february   we had million of borrowings outstanding 
in april and may  the company entered into two interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts of million increased to million in may and million 
these agreements provide for a payment to the company in the event libor exceeds  mitigating our exposure to increases in libor 
at february   the aggregate interest rate cap agreement notional amount was million 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income from investments net of interest expense on the replacement facility 
assuming that our investments as of february  were to remain constant for a full fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate terms  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would cause a corresponding increase of approximately million to our interest income net of interest expense 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could magnify or diminish our sensitivity to interest rate changes  nor does it account for divergences in libor and the commercial paper rate  which have historically moved in tandem but  in times of unusual credit dislocations  have experienced periods of divergence 
accordingly no assurances can be given that actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
