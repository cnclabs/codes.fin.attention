item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent in  which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta  cymbalta  animal health products  insulin products  cialis  and zyprexa  offset by the decline in gemzar revenue 
cost of sales and marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue  while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased 
as a result of these factors  as well as higher other income in and the items noted below  net income increased percent to billion  and earnings per share increased percent to per share  in as compared to billion  or per share  in us health care reform due to the enactment of health care reform in the us in march  total revenue decreased by million pretax  or 
per share  in as a result of higher rebates 
we also recorded a one time non cash deferred income tax charge in the first quarter of million  or 
per share  associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our us retiree health plan 
acquisitions note we incurred acquired in process research and development ipr d charges associated with the in licensing arrangement with acrux limited acrux of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  or 
per share  in  primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions 
acquisitions note we incurred acquired ipr d charges associated with an in licensing arrangement with incyte corporation incyte of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by  for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 
we incurred pretax charges of million in connection with the claims of several states related to zyprexa  which decreased earnings per share by 
late stage pipeline our long term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we currently have more than potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development 
there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products 
there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development 
the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take to years or longer and cost more than billion 
failure can occur at any point in the process  including late in the process after substantial investment 
as a result  most research programs will not generate financial returns 
new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  limited scope of approved uses  difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture  or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
delays and uncertainties in the us food and drug administration fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity 
consequently  it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 
we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules  and a delay in  or termination of  one project will not by itself necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending 
due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process  we cannot reliably estimate the nature  timing  completion dates  and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects  nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project 
each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none are individually material to our consolidated research and development expense 
while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes  we must make significant cost estimations and allocations  some of which rely on data that is neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms 
as a consequence  we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by therapeutic category 
new molecular entities currently in phase iii clinical trial testing include the following baff antibody an anti baff antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus bi a sglt inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim enzastaurin a small molecule for the treatment of diffuse large b cell lymphoma glp fc a glucagon like peptide analog for the treatment of type diabetes necitumumab a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for non small cell lung cancer neri a potent and highly selective norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for major depression ramucirumab a monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for metastatic breast and gastric cancers solanezumab an amyloid beta a antibody for the treatment of alzheimer s disease new molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review include the following arxxant a potential treatment for diabetic retinopathy florbetapir a molecular imaging tool under investigation for the detection of beta amyloid plaque in the brain 
the absence of beta amyloid plaque in the brain makes a diagnosis of alzheimer s disease unlikely 
linagliptin a dpp inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim liprotamase a non porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy the following are late stage pipeline developments that have occurred since january  axiron 
we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement in the first quarter for the commercialization of acrux s experimental testosterone solution axiron  which the fda approved in the fourth quarter as a replacement therapy in men for certain conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of testosterone 
we  along with our partner acrux  expect to launch axiron in the us by mid bi and linagliptin 
in january  we announced a global agreement with boehringer ingelheim to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid and late stage development 
included are boehringer ingelheim s two oral diabetes agents  linagliptin and bi  as well as our two basal insulin analogues  ly and ly  along with an option to co develop and co commercialize lilly s anti tgf beta monoclonal antibody 
bydureon us in october  the fda issued a complete response letter regarding the new drug application nda for bydureon 
in the complete response letter  the fda requested a safety study to measure the potential for heart rhythm disturbances when exenatide is used at higher than average doses 
additionally  the fda requested the results of the already completed duration study to evaluate the efficacy  and the labeling of the safety and effectiveness  of the commercial formulation of bydureon 
we  along with our partners amylin pharmaceuticals  inc amylin and alkermes  inc 
alkermes  plan to submit our reply to the complete response letter in the second half of amylin received written feedback from the fda indicating approval of the study design for the required safety study to support the regulatory application 
the study is expected to begin in february 
based on the requirements for additional data  this will likely be considered a class resubmission requiring a six month review 
bydureon europe 
we  along with our partners amylin and alkermes  submitted bydureon for review by the european medicines agency in the first quarter of cymbalta 
the fda approved cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain in november this has been established in studies in patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis 
florbetapir 
in december  we completed the acquisition of avid radiopharmaceuticals  inc avid  a company developing novel molecular imaging compounds intended for the detection and monitoring of chronic human diseases 
in addition  the fda recently assigned priority review designation for amyvid florbetapir  avid s lead program in development 
the peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee of the fda held a meeting to discuss amyvid s nda in january the committee decided that it could not recommend approval of amyvid at this time based on the currently available data  but voted unanimously to recommend approval of amyvid conditional on a reader training program that demonstrates reader accuracy and consistency through a re read of previously acquired scans 
the committee supported that efficacy was established and there were no significant safety concerns 
liprotamase 
in july  we completed our acquisition of alnara pharmaceuticals  inc alnara  a privately held company developing protein therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases 
in january  the fda gastrointestinal drugs advisory committee voted to recommend non approval of liprotamase  alnara s non porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy  for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency epi 
during the meeting  the committee had questions about the degree of efficacy of liprotamase and recommended that additional studies be conducted prior to considering approval of liprotamase for epi 
we will continue to work with the fda to address the questions raised in the meeting as the agency moves toward a final decision on the application 
livalo 
we  along with our partner  kowa pharmaceuticals america inc  launched livalo in the us in the second quarter of in addition to a proper diet  livalo is used for the treatment of high cholesterol primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia in adults 
necitumumab 
in february  we and bristol myers squibb company stopped enrollment in one of the two global phase iii studies evaluating necitumumab  an investigational anti cancer agent  as a first line treatment for advanced non small cell lung cancer nsclc 
the decision to stop enrollment in the phase iii non squamous nsclc inspire trial followed an independent data monitoring committee dmc recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism blood clots in the experimental arm of the study 
the same dmc also noted that patients who have already received two or more cycles of necitumumab appear to have a lower ongoing risk for these safety concerns 
these patients may choose to remain on the trial  after being informed of the additional potential risks 
investigators will continue to assess patients after two cycles to determine if there is a potential benefit from treatment 
semagacestat 
in august  we halted development of semagacestat  a gamma secretase inhibitor being studied as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease  because preliminary results from two ongoing long term phase iii studies showed the compound did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living 
tasisulam 
in december  we suspended all current phase iii studies evaluating tasisulam as a second line treatment for those with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
tasisulam  an investigational  small molecule anti cancer compound  continues to be studied in other types of cancers 
teplizumab 
in october  we and our partner  macrogenics  inc  announced that an independent dmc completed a planned analysis of one year safety and efficacy data of the prot g phase iii clinical trial of teplizumab  an investigational biologic under development for the treatment of individuals with recent onset type diabetes 
the dmc concluded that the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was not met 
the dmc  noting that all administration of experimental drug had been completed  commented that appropriate safety monitoring is warranted 
no unanticipated safety issues were identified in the dmc s review 
the companies have decided to suspend further enrollment and dosing of patients in two other ongoing clinical trials of teplizumab in type diabetes 
in october  we notified macrogenics of our decision to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development of teplizumab 
legal  regulatory  and other matters the us compound patent for gemzar expired november  our method of use patent expiring in was held invalid by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
we are seeking review by the us supreme court  but generic gemcitabine was introduced to the us market in mid november  and gemzar sales are experiencing a rapid and severe decline 
the us district court for the district of new jersey ruled that our method of use patent for strattera  which expires in  is invalid 
our appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit was heard in december  and we are awaiting a ruling 
the court of appeals has granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered 
several generic companies have tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine  and  should the appeal be unsuccessful  we would anticipate a rapid and severe decline in strattera sales due to generic competition 
the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of in march brings significant changes to us health care 
these changes began to affect our financial results in the first quarter of and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future 
changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries  which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from percent to percent  were generally effective in the first quarter of this rebate has been expanded to managed medicaid  a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations  under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies 
additionally  a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve low income and uninsured patients known as b facilities has been expanded 
also  there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers  such as us  who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the medicare part d drug benefit 
beginning in  the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers 
while this tax will not take effect for three more years  accounting rules dictate that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a one time non cash charge upon enactment of the tax law change  which we recorded in the first quarter of in addition  the federal government created an expedited regulatory approval pathway in the us for biosimilars or follow on biologics copies of biological compounds 
biologics will have at least years of data package protection following launch 
congress is expected to take up patent law reform in  some proposals would strengthen the pharmaceutical business model while others under consideration might pose some risks 
beginning in  drug manufacturers will provide a discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage 
the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between and additionally  beginning in  a non tax deductible annual fee will be imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 
this fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs 
a guidance project is currently under way within the irs and us treasury concerning the implementation of this fee 
these costs will be included in marketing  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of us based companies 
some provisions changing taxation of international income were enacted in august these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future  reform of us taxation  including taxation of international income  continues to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration 
a significant change to the us tax system  including changes to the taxation of international income  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
on october   puerto rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations 
this tax will be included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
we believe this tax should be creditable against our us income taxes 
certain other federal and state health care proposals may continue to be debated  and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices 
these proposals include legalizing the importation of prescription drugs and other cost control strategies 
in addition  the constitutionality of us health care reform is being challenged 
we expect pricing pressures at state levels to become more severe  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and several european countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures 
there are proposals for cost containment measures pending in a number of additional countries  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls  limit access to or reimbursement for our products  or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact  given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments 
operating results revenue our worldwide revenue for increased percent  to billion  driven by the collective growth of alimta  cymbalta  animal health products  insulin products  cialis  and zyprexa  offset by the decline in gemzar revenue 
worldwide sales volume increased percent  while selling prices contributed percent of revenue growth  and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible 
revenue in the us increased percent  to billion  due to higher prices 
revenue outside the us increased percent  to billion  due to increased demand  partially offset by lower prices 
in  total revenue was reduced by million due to the impact of us health care reform 
the following table summarizes our revenue activity in compared with year ended december  year ended december  total percent change from product us outside us total dollars in millions zyprexa cymbalta alimta humalog cialis animal health products gemzar humulin evista forteo strattera other pharmaceutical products total net product sales collaboration and other revenue total revenue us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 
numbers may not add due to rounding 
collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of erbitux royalties and percent of byetta s gross margin in the us zyprexa  our top selling product  is a treatment for schizophrenia  acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder  and bipolar maintenance 
zyprexa sales in the us increased percent in  driven by higher prices  partially offset by lower demand 
sales outside the us decreased percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in europe and canada  partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan 
we will lose effective exclusivity for zyprexa in the us in october we will also lose effective exclusivity in most of europe in in the five major european countries  which in the aggregate had approximately billion in sales for  we will lose effective exclusivity in april spain and september france  germany  italy  and the united kingdom 
several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic olanzapine  and we expect generic olanzapine to be introduced in these markets immediately following the expiration of the patents 
while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on zyprexa sales  we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our zyprexa sales  which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
in japan  our second largest market for zyprexa  with more than million of sales in  our patent expires in december sales of cymbalta  a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder  diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain  generalized anxiety disorder  and in the united states for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia  increased percent in the us  driven primarily by higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand in japan  europe  and canada 
sales of alimta  a treatment for various cancers  increased percent in the us  due primarily to increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand

sales outside the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher prices 
sales of gemzar  a product approved to treat various cancers  decreased percent in the us  due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition  which began in november  following the expiration of the compound patent 
sales outside the us decreased percent  due primarily to generic competition in most major markets 
we expect sales to decline in  with severe declines in the us sales of humulin  an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes  increased percent in the us  driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand 
sales outside the us remained essentially flat when compared to  due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of evista  a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer  remained essentially flat in the us  due to decreased demand offset by increased prices

sales of forteo  an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men  decreased percent in the us  driven by lower demand  partially offset by higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher prices 
sales of strattera  a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children  adolescents  and in the us in adults  decreased percent in the us  due primarily to lower demand  and to a lesser extent  lower net effective selling prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand  partially offset by lower prices 
the us district court for the district of new jersey ruled that the us method of use patent for strattera  which expires in  is invalid 
we are currently appealing this decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the court of appeals has granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered 
while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on strattera sales  if our appeal is unsuccessful  we expect that the introduction of generics would result in a rapid and severe decline in our us strattera sales 
worldwide sales of byetta  an injectable product for the treatment of type diabetes  decreased percent to million during due to competitive pressures in the us and european markets 
we report as revenue our percent share of byetta s gross margin in the us  percent of byetta sales outside the us  and our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin 
our revenues decreased percent to million in we report as revenue for erbitux  a product approved to treat various cancers  the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales 
our revenues were million in  compared with million in animal health product sales in the us and outside the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products 
sales of comfortis  a flea medication for dogs  increased percent in gross margin  costs  and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by percentage points in to percent 
this increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices  partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the us  partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company wide cost containment efforts 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules  including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with the in licensing agreement with acrux  compared with million in resulting from the in licensing agreement with incyte 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 
in  we recognized charges totaling million for asset impairments  restructuring and other special charges 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense improved million to a net expense of million in  due primarily to net gains on equity investments  lower net interest expense  damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following zyprexa patent litigation in germany  and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at the company s enfield  connecticut  distribution center 
the effective tax rate was percent for the full year in  the effective tax rate was percent 
the effective tax rate increased due to million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to us health care reform 
the effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 
operating results financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent in  which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta  cymbalta  humalog  and zyprexa and the inclusion of erbitux revenue as a result of the imclone systems inc imclone acquisition in november the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in and increased our cost of sales in  which contributed to an improvement in gross margin 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue  while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than sales 
we incurred income tax expense of billion in  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent 
earnings increased to billion  and earnings per share increased to per share  in as compared to a net loss of billion  and a loss per share of in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of several highlighted items 
the highlighted items for are summarized in the executive overview 
the highlighted items are summarized as follows acquisitions note we recognized charges totaling billion pretax associated with the acquisition of imclone  which decreased earnings per share by 
these amounts include an ipr d charge of billion pretax 
the remaining net expenses are related to imclone s operating results subsequent to the acquisition  incremental interest costs  and amortization of the intangible asset associated with erbitux

totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
a similar charge of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by  was included in cost of sales 
these charges were primarily associated with the sale of our greenfield  indiana site  the termination of the air insulin program  and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations 
we recorded charges of billion pretax related to the federal and state zyprexa investigations led by the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa  as well as the resolution of a multi state investigation regarding zyprexa involving states and the district of columbia  which decreased earnings per share by 
other note we recognized a discrete income tax benefit of million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit of our federal income tax returns for the years through  which increased earnings per share by 
revenue our worldwide revenue for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by growth of alimta  cymbalta  humalog  and zyprexa  and the inclusion of erbitux revenue as a result of the imclone acquisition

gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin increased to percent of total revenue compared with percent for this increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year  which decreased cost of sales in  but increased cost of sales in marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside the us  higher incentive compensation  and the impact of the imclone acquisition  partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to the imclone acquisition and increased late stage clinical trial costs 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with the in licensing agreement with incyte  compared with billion in the ipr d charge included billion resulting from the acquisition of imclone 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  primarily related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site and special charges related to zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys general  compared with billion in the charges were primarily associated with the resolution of zyprexa investigations with the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania and multiple states

our net loss was driven by the billion ipr d charge for imclone and the billion zyprexa investigation settlements 
the ipr d charge was not tax deductible  and only a portion of the zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible 
in addition  we recorded tax expense associated with the imclone acquisition  as well as a discrete income tax benefit of million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  the increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of billion  partially offset by dividends paid of billion  business and product acquisitions of billion  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
capital expenditures of million during were million less than in we expect capital expenditures to be between million and million as we invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products  continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems  and invest in our oncology biotechnology capabilities 
total debt at december   was billion  an increase of million from december   which was due to the million increase in the fair value of hedged debt and an increase in short term debt of million 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s are aa and a  respectively 
our moody s long term debt rating was moved to a from a in november our ratings outlook from both moody s and standard and poor s is stable 
dividends of per share were paid in and  was the th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments 
in the fourth quarter of  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of  the quarterly dividend was maintained at 
per share  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
as of the fourth quarter of  the us and global economic recoveries proceed but face continued headwinds 
us economic data in the fourth quarter reflected a steady pace of economic recovery  though the rate of recovery has not been sufficient to materially reduce unemployment 
given persistently high unemployment and little sign of near term inflation risk  the us federal reserve has maintained its accommodative monetary policy  most recently through its november announcement of expanded asset purchases 
the federal reserve continues its policy stance of exceptionally low rates for an extended period to stimulate lending and economic growth 
high sovereign debt levels and efforts at fiscal austerity in the us and other developed countries continue to be a concern for many economists and are predicted to challenge the economic recovery globally 
given this backdrop  both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges and are taking steps to reduce the costs of care  including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates in the us  price cuts in government systems outside the us  and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs globally 
we continue to monitor the potential near term impact of the economic environment on prescription trends  the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers  the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation  the federal government s involvement in the us economy  and various international government funding levels 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  and dividends in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings 
because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt  our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in may various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  and the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues  cash flows  and earnings 
through  we expect to lose effective exclusivity for the following key products zyprexa october us  various dates in major europe cymbalta june us humalog may us evista march us cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity  based on completion of pediatric studies 
gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in the us and major european countries france  germany  italy  spain and the united kingdom  and humalog has lost exclusivity in major european countries 
in addition  we face us patent litigation over alimta  cymbalta  and strattera  and it is possible we could lose our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the expiration of the relevant patents 
see the hatch waxman patent litigation discussion in note and in the legal and regulatory matters section below 
revenue from alimta  cymbalta  humalog  and zyprexa contribute materially to our results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
the loss of exclusivity would likely result in generic competition  generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  our goal is to partially mitigate the effect on our operations  liquidity  and financial position through growth in our patent protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period  in emerging markets  in japan  and in our animal health business 
our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patent protected products in these markets 
in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december   to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
we excluded long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of billion  as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year  none of which are individually material 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales return  rebate  and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
for approximately percent of our sales  this is at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
the remaining sales  which are outside the us  are recorded at the point of delivery 
provisions for returns  rebates  and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
in the us  the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 
we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns 
we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
once the product is returned  it is destroyed 
consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance  when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales 
this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
because of this time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales returns  rebates  and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
us sales returns  federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid  and medicare rebates reduced sales by billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the sales return  medicaid  and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our sales returns  medicaid  and medicare rebate liability was million 
our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately percent and percent of our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us returns  rebate  and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to sales returns  discounts  and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these returns  rebates  and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial condition of the insurers  and the possibility of and length of time for collection 
in the past several years  we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
annually  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by million 
a one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by million 
the us plans represent approximately percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of indefinite lived and long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present 
when required  a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination  all of which require multiple assumptions 
we utilize the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  patent protection  historical pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
this analysis is performed for each project independently 
for ipr d assets  the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product  as discussed previously in the late stage pipeline section 
the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products 
as such  it is likely that some ipr d assets will become impaired at some time in the future 
the estimated future cash flows  based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of million and million  respectively 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to  which includes the dilutive impact of the upfront fee and other anticipated expenses related to the collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  but excludes potential restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 
we expect that total revenue growth will be flat to slightly increasing  which assumes we maintain our patent exclusivity for us strattera sales  and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets  including the us starting in october  and the continued severe erosion of us gemzar sales 
we anticipate that the impact of us health care reform will lower revenue by million to million 
we expect these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of alimta  cialis  cymbalta  effient  humalog  and animal health products 
we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline approximately two percentage points 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low to mid single digits and include an estimated million to million in non tax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform  while research and development expense growth is expected to be relatively flat 
other net  expense is expected to be a net expense of between million and million 
cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of between and million  as well as anticipated business development activity and our dividend 
private securities litigation reform act of a caution concerning forward looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by us  including those above  are based on management s belief at the time they are made 
however  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the implementation of us health care reform  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired ipr d charges  foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions  changes in effective tax rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  patent disputes  and government investigations  the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects are discussed earlier in this section and in item a  risk factors 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters  we believe that  except as specifically noted below  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 
patent litigation we are engaged in the following us patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatch waxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of cymbalta sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking permission to market generic versions of cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents the earliest of which expires in 
of these challengers  all allege non infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation  and nine allege invalidity and some also allege nonenforceability of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine 
of the nine challengers to the compound patent claims  one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia 
in november we filed lawsuits in us district court for the southern district of indiana against actavis elizabeth llc  aurobindo pharma ltd  cobalt laboratories  inc  impax laboratories  inc  lupin limited  sandoz inc  and wockhardt limited  seeking rulings that the compound patent claims are valid  infringed  and enforceable 
we filed similar lawsuits in the same court against sun pharma global  inc in december and against anchen pharmaceuticals  inc in august the cases have been consolidated and actions against all but wockhardt limited have been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal 
the wockhardt limited trial is scheduled to begin in june gemzar teva parenteral medicines  inc teva  sun pharmaceutical industries inc sun and several other generic companies sought permission to market generic versions of gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents compound patent expiring in and method of use patent expiring in 
we filed lawsuits in the us district court for the southern district of indiana against teva february and several other generic companies  seeking rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed 
in november  sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan  seeking rulings that our method of use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable  or would not be infringed by the sale of sun s generic product 
in august  the district court in michigan granted a motion by sun for partial summary judgment  invalidating our method of use patent  and the opinion was affirmed by a panel of the court of appeals for the federal circuit in july we are seeking review of this decision by the us supreme court 
in march  the district court in indiana upheld the validity of our compound patent in the teva case  but applied collateral estoppel with regard to our method of use patent  given the ruling in the sun case 
generic gemcitabine was introduced to the us market in mid november alimta teva  app pharmaceuticals  llc app  and barr laboratories  inc barr each submitted andas seeking approval to market generic versions of alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant us patent licensed from the trustees of princeton university and expiring in  and alleging the patent is invalid 
we  along with princeton  filed lawsuits in the us district court for the district of delaware against teva  app  and barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed 
in november  the district court ruled from the bench that judgment would be entered in lilly s favor  upholding the patent s validity 
plaintiffs may appeal this decision once the judgment is entered 
evista in  teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva usa submitted an anda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents expiring in and alleging that these patents are invalid  not enforceable  or not infringed 
in june  we filed a lawsuit against teva usa in the us district court for the southern district of indiana  seeking a ruling that these patents are valid  enforceable  and being infringed by teva usa 
in september  the court upheld our method of use patents the last expires in and the court held that our particle size patents expiring are invalid 
both rulings were upheld by the appeals court in september  and the period for further appeals has expired 
strattera actavis elizabeth llc actavis  apotex inc apotex  aurobindo pharma ltd 
aurobindo  mylan pharmaceuticals inc mylan  sandoz inc sandoz  sun pharmaceutical industries limited sun ltd  and teva usa each submitted an anda seeking permission to market generic versions of strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant us patent expiring in  and alleging that this patent is invalid 
in  we brought a lawsuit against actavis  apotex  aurobindo  mylan  sandoz  sun ltd  and teva usa in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
in august  the court ruled that our patent is invalid 
several companies have received final approval to market generic atomoxetine  but the court of appeals for the federal circuit granted an injunction prohibiting the launch of generic atomoxetine until the court renders an opinion 
the appeal was heard by the court in december and we are waiting for a ruling 
zydus pharmaceuticals zydus filed an action in the new jersey district court in october seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the right to launch a generic atomoxetine product  based on the district court ruling 
we believe that zydus is subject to the injunction issued by the court of appeals 
we believe each of these hatch waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation 
however  it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us in canada  several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our zyprexa patent expiring in 
in april  the canadian federal court ruled against the first challenger  apotex inc apotex  and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in february in june  the canadian federal court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger  novopharm ltd 
novopharm  was justified and denied our request that novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in canada 
novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in canada in the third quarter of in september  the canadian federal court ruled against us in the novapharm suit  finding our patent invalid 
however  in july the appeals court set aside the decision and remitted the limited issues of utility and sufficiency of disclosure to the trial court 
in germany  the german federal supreme court upheld the validity of our zyprexa patent expiring in in december  reversing an earlier decision of the federal patent court 
following the decision of the supreme court  the generic companies who launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier decision either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to injunction 
we have negotiated settlements of the damages arising from infringement with most of the generic companies 
we have received challenges in a number of other countries  including spain  austria  australia  portugal  and several smaller european countries 
in spain  we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenges  but additional actions against multiple generic companies are now pending 
in march  the district court of hague ruled against us and revoked our compound patent in the netherlands 
we have appealed this decision 
we have also successfully defended zyprexa patents in austria and portugal 
we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a country by country basis 
we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation 
the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
zyprexa litigation we were named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and notified of other claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york edny mdl no 

since june  we have settled approximately  claims 
the two primary settlements were as follows in  we settled and paid more than  claims for approximately million 
in  we settled and paid more than  claims for approximately million 
we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims  consisting of approximately lawsuits in the us covering approximately plaintiffs  of which about lawsuits covering about plaintiffs are part of the mdl 
we have a trial scheduled in texas state court in august in january  we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa  and the state medicaid fraud control units of states and the district of columbia  of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
as part of the resolution  we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act for the off label promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia  including alzheimer s dementia  between september and march we recorded a charge of billion for this matter in the third quarter of and paid substantially all of this amount in as part of the settlement  we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs  which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years 
the agreement also provides for an independent third party review organization to assess and report on the company s systems  processes  policies  procedures  and practices 
in october  we reached a settlement with states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws 
while there was no finding that we violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted  we paid million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years  through consent decrees filed with the settling states 
we were served with lawsuits filed by the states of alaska  arkansas  connecticut  idaho  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  montana  new mexico  pennsylvania  south carolina  utah  and west virginia alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
we settled the zyprexa related claims of all of these states  incurring pretax charges of million in and million in in  two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit  brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in on similar grounds 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
in september  judge weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors  excluding governmental entities and individual consumers and denied our motion for summary judgment 
in september  both decisions were reversed by the second circuit court of appeals  which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs overpricing claim 
plaintiffs are seeking review of this decision by the us supreme court 
an unfavorable outcome in this case could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
other product liability litigation we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des  thimerosal  and byetta 
approximately a third of these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
product liability insurance because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past several years  we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future
