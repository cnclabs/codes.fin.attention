industry overview the pay television industry is comprised primarily of program suppliers  pay television channel providers and pay television distributors 
program suppliers  from whom we acquire or license a portion of our programming  include many of the major production studios  independent production companies and other independent owners of programming 
these program suppliers create  develop and finance the production of  or control rights to  movies  television miniseries  series and other programming 
we are a pay television channel provider 
pay television channel providers include all channel providers except over the air broadcasters and major us cable and satellite networks 
pay television channel providers often produce programming and acquire or license programming from program suppliers and generally package the programming according to an overriding theme and brand strategy 
pay television providers and distributors generally restrict viewership through security encryption devices that limit viewership to paying subscribers 
pay television channel providers compete with each other for distribution and to attract viewers and advertisers 
pay television providers generally target audiences with a certain demographic composition  so that they can then sell advertising to advertisers seeking to reach the providers demographic audiences 
pay television distributors own and operate the platforms used to deliver channels to subscribers 
these distributors use several different technologies to reach their subscribers as described below 
distributors attempt to create a mix of channels that will be attractive to their subscriber population in an attempt to gain new subscribers and to minimize subscriber turnover 
distributors have different levels of service for subscribers  with each service level containing different package of channels 
pay television distributors often create tiers of programming services  and our services occasionally are offered on family or movie programming tiers 
various distributors offer additional broadband services such as internet access  telephony and video on demand over their systems 
as a result of the competition for use of the digital cable capacity for channels and broadband services  pay television channel providers are often required initially to pay subscriber acquisition fees to pay television distributors for carriage on their systems or the addition of subscribers 
these subscriber acquisition fees are paid to television distributors on a per subscriber basis and generally in advance of any receipt of subscriber fee revenue from such pay television distributors 

table of contents distribution platforms four major distribution platforms are currently used to transmit programming 
first  cable television systems use coaxial or fiber optic cable to transmit multiple channels between a central facility  known as a headend  and the individual subscriber television set 
second  analog and digital satellite broadcast systems such as direct to home or dth use satellite transponders to broadcast television programming to individual dwellings with satellite reception equipment  including a dish and a decoder 
third  telephone companies telcos feature a combination of traditional cable and protocol television iptv technologies 
for example  verizon adopted a hybrid model combining traditional cable and iptv technologies while at t launched full fledged iptv networks 
while traditional cable systems devote a slice of bandwidth for each channel and then cablecast them all out at once  iptv uses a switched video architecture in which only the channel being watched at that moment is sent over the network  freeing up capacity for other features and more interactivity 
lastly  channels can also be distributed through satellite master antenna television smatv 
smatv is used primarily for buildings  such as apartments and hotels that receive programming from satellites by means of a single antenna that is connected to the buildings headend 
the television signals are then distributed to individual units in the building by cable 
from time to time  for promotional purposes  we exhibit excerpts of certain programming on our website 
we currently exhibit the entire seasons and of adoption  our original series  on our website 
sources of revenue subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
rates we receive per subscriber vary with changes in the following factors  among others the degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and length of the contract term and other commercial terms 
we are in continuous negotiations with our existing distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising revenue 
we have been requested in the past by major distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
our channels are usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and are not offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which one of our channels is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channels alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead  we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the channels 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying one of our channels and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
the 
table of contents level of subscribers could also be affected by a distributor repositioning our channels from one tier to another tier 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenue and costs 
based upon these analyses  if subscriber acquisition fees are needed  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees 
we have generally paid certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to obtain initial carriage on domestic pay distributor systems 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement and periodically thereafter  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
generally  our distribution agreements last from three to ten years  and usually include annual increases of subscriber fees 
in the past  for the most part  these distribution agreements also involved payments by us for the establishment of the relationship or  together with or in lieu of any payment  waived subscriber fees for our channels to distributors for a period of time 
please see item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information regarding subscriber fees 
advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
most advertising supported cable networks rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots with a commitment to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
an additional form of television advertising is direct response advertising  which is designed to elicit a specific and quantifiable response from the viewer 
unlike spot advertising  fees payable for this form of advertising are measured by viewer response to advertising  such as product purchases  rather than the viewer ratings which measures success in programming 
a majority of the hallmark channel advertising revenue is comprised of spot advertising 
the hallmark movie channel revenue has been comprised of spot advertising commencing in april and primarily direct response revenue in previous years 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our rates for spot advertisements are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
advertising revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls often referred to as audience deficiency units or adus 
adus are units of inventory rights to utilize future advertising timeframes that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for past advertisements in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed viewership ratings 
adus are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
historically  there has been no cash paid to an advertiser to settle adus  but in and  the company provided an immaterial amount of cash for settlements to certain advertisers 
the remainder of the revenue is recognized as the make good advertising time is delivered in satisfaction of adus 
advertising revenue from direct response advertising depends largely upon actions of viewers 

table of contents we typically sell approximately of our channels advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july of each year  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for adus and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market and to advertisers that purchase up front inventory on a calendar year basis

we currently and primarily use the websites www 
hallmarkchannel 
com and www 
hallmarkmoviechannel 
com to promote the two networks  their programming and to provide information to consumers 
these websites promote major programming events  such as original movie premieres and program acquisitions as well as provide information regarding the channels programs and their talents 
further  the sites provide platforms for viewer participation in the channels sweepstakes promotions and community areas 
the sites have advertiser imaging including banner messages and video content 
channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the marketing and creative services departments to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming and original production 
our staff or third parties review all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically created by the company employees  but are occasionally outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the channels 
occasionally  these interstitials are sponsored by advertisers  resulting in additional advertising revenue 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales  research and distributor sales and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the effectiveness of programming content and sequence 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be distributed to the subscribers of the channels 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes of the hallmark channel and hallmark movie channel programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in los angeles  california  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed 
the channels are compiled in high definition hd and then the same versions of the channels are created in standard definition sd 
the los angeles facility transmits the combined signals to a satellite transponder that covers the united states 
the transponder transmits the signal back to cable head end facilities  telcos and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channels to their subscribers

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from broadcast networks  tnt  usa network  hgtv  tv land  lifetime  own  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  basic analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following programming 
we have established a track record of providing high quality family programming 

table of contents pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name 
our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn affects ratings and advertising revenue 
experienced management 
members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as abc  fox family  discovery channel  amc and usa networks 
competitive risks we believe that our primary competitive risks include the following one primary channel distributed domestically 
we operate only two channels 
many of our competitors have more than two channels and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 
entertainment programming 
our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising 
our ratings are a significant and generally positive factor 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affect rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channels to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channels research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channels market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channels performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel 
available information we will make available free of charge through our website  www

if any of management assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  our actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
we will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
our business has a history of net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we sustain an operating profit or a positive cash flow 
if we are not able to do so  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses  to continue to be profitable before interest expense and to continue to generate a positive cash flow  we will need to increase our advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  maintaining or increasing the distribution of our channels  attracting younger viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  increasing our ratings and maintaining or increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million  and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility to support our operations 
as a result of our present level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we are required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  
table of contents we are  and will continue to be  limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and offers to purchase the company or its assets at prices that may be attractive to stockholders may be limited 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
we have significant interest payments  which may impact our future operations 
the recapitalization significantly reduced our outstanding indebtedness and interest expense  nevertheless  even with the recapitalization  there is still substantial indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations has and will continue to be used to make interest payments and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
although in the past twelve months we generated positive cash flow from operations  unanticipated significant expense or any developments that hamper our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  may result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 
most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
these clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees  launch support  local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or increased cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability or maintaining a positive cash flow and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we experienced declines in viewer ratings across demographic categories  compared to the same periods of  resulting in decreases in advertising revenues and cash flows 
a number of changes to our program schedule were implemented in the third quarter of these changes have caused a temporary disruption to established viewing patterns for our audience resulting in declines in household ratings but over time are intended to increase our delivery of viewers in the women demographic category 
we are considering further changes in our programming that may be helpful to our ratings 
we must successfully implement the program rescheduling with an increase in ratings  which is uncertain  or otherwise address the decrease in ratings in order to maintain or increase our advertising revenues  to maintain subscriber fees and to maintain or improve our cash flow from operations 
in addition  our delivery of the channels continues to be impacted by industry developments 
one potentially significant factor is the continued growth of time shifting digital video recording devices dvrs 
dvrs heighten the impact of competition as viewers are able to increase their access to what they consider to be new  compelling content 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve improved results 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i a continued decline in viewer ratings mentioned above  ii the current economic environment presents uncertainty regarding the condition of the advertising marketplace and the financial health of many industry segments and individual companies  including those which advertise on our channels  iii we may be unable to reduce our average viewer age to be within our target audience of viewers between the ages of and  iv we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  v our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  vi the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or vii we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots to fulfill guaranteed delivery numbers which affect the availability of 
table of contents advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels and our number of subscribers 
hallmark cards controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark cards  through hcc  its wholly owned subsidiary  owns all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock and owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
additionally  a significant portion of our overall indebtedness is held by hallmark cards or its wholly owned affiliates 
this control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of common stock 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
in addition  the control that hallmark cards and or these specific wholly owned affiliates may exert over us  either directly or indirectly  could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced outages  delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of 
table of contents our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity deficit could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  including the following failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investors in any quarter  economic conditions that adversely affect our advertising rates or our number of subscribers  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  perceptions by the investing community or our customers with respect to the prospects of our company or our industry  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure by us to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company outstanding common stock  only million shares approximately  are held by non affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company common stock 
risks relating to our industry the recent change in the television rating system in the united states could reduce our channels revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
in  nielsen modified its ratings system by increasing its household sample size 
in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
as the impact of the changes continue to take effect  our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the nature of the changes in the measurement systems 
from the beginning of the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately under the new ratings measurement system compared to the system previously in use 
we continue to factor the new rating information into our advertising rates as nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our channels revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and 
table of contents other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels having lower viewership  such as our channels  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channels without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and operating results  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position

item legal proceedings on july   a lawsuit was brought in the delaware court of chancery against each member of the board of directors of the company  hallmark cards and its affiliates  as well as the company as a nominal defendant  by a minority stockholder of the company regarding the then proposed recapitalization 
the plaintiff is s 
muoio co 
llc which owned beneficially approximately of the company class a common stock at the time of the complaint  according to the complaint and filings with the sec 
the lawsuit claims to be a derivative action and a class action on behalf of the plaintiff and other minority stockholders of the company 
the lawsuit alleges  among other things  that  the defendants have breached fiduciary duties owed to the company and minority stockholders in connection with the recapitalization transactions 
the lawsuit includes allegations that the consummation of the recapitalization transactions would result in an unfair amount of equity issued to the majority stockholders  thereby reducing the minority stockholders equity and voting interests in the company  and that the majority stockholders would be able to eliminate the minority stockholders through a short form merger 
the complaint requested the court enjoin the defendants from consummating the recapitalization transactions and award plaintiff fees and expenses incurred in bringing the lawsuit 
on july   a stipulation providing for notice of transaction the stipulation was filed with the delaware court of chancery 
the stipulation provided that the company could not consummate the transaction contemplated in the recapitalization transactions until not less than seven weeks after providing the plaintiff with a notice of the terms of the proposed transaction  including copies of the final transaction agreements 
if the plaintiff moved for preliminary injunctive relief with respect to any such transaction  the parties would establish a schedule with the court of chancery to resolve such motion during the seven week period 
in addition  following the decision of the court of chancery  the company would not consummate any transaction for a period of at least one week  
table of contents during which time any party may seek an expedited appeal 
the stipulation further provided that the plaintiff would withdraw its motion for preliminary injunction filed on july  and that the action would be stayed until the earlier of providing the notice of a transaction or an announcement by the company that it was no longer considering a transaction 
by a letter of february   the plaintiff in this lawsuit informed the special committee of the board of directors  which considered and negotiated the recapitalization  that the plaintiff objected to the proposed recapitalization on the terms set forth in the term sheet dated february  the plaintiff asserted  among other things  that the transactions contemplated by the term sheet would unfairly dilute the economic and voting interests of the company minority stockholders  that the transactions should be subject to a vote of the majority of the minority stockholders and that the proposed transactions remain inadequate

current challenges the company faces numerous operating challenges 
among them are increasing viewership ratings  maintaining and increasing advertising revenue  maintaining and expanding the distribution of the channels  broadening viewership demographics to meet our target audience  and controlling costs and expenses 
ratings ratings success plays a significant role in our ability to achieve our distribution and advertising goals 
our ratings declined from th in total day viewership and th for prime time in to th in total day viewership and th for prime time in we believe our ratings are affected by our ability to i acquire and produce series and movies that appeal to our target demographic and ii develop a programming schedule that attracts a high number of viewers 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the hallmark channel highest ratings 
in the past  the company has typically incurred additional marketing and promotional expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies to drive higher ratings 
certain acquired series delivered historically strong ratings  but recently they have been part of the decline experienced in viewer ratings 
in order to reverse the recent decline in ratings  we plan to continue or increase the number of our original productions and develop a programming schedule that attracts a greater number of viewers in our target demographic  all while controlling the costs and expenses relating to these actions 
our recent agreements with martha stewart living omnimedia  including the acquisition of exclusive rights to the live daytime lifestyle program the martha stewart show and rights to the extensive library of martha stewart branded lifestyle programming  represent a key part of our strategy to attract viewers that appeal to relatively higher cpm ie  advertising rates per thousand viewers advertisers 
we introduced this lifestyle programming in various dayparts in the second quarter of  leading to the september premier of the martha stewart show on the hallmark channel 
additionally in september  hallmark channel premiered several other original lifestyle shows for the daytime lifestyle block 
these program changes have resulted and may result at least initially in reductions in the ratings delivery of the channel  but our plan is that  over time  these changes will increase our revenue through the delivery of a more targeted demographic and attraction of higher cpm advertisers 

table of contents prior to the second quarter of  the hallmark movie channel had not been the subject of ratings measurement by nielsen media research 
since then  however  the hallmark movie channel has had nielsen ratings and we have been selling advertising inventory for the hallmark movie channel based on a price per unit of audience measurement 
advertising revenue the overall improvement in the economy during had a favorable impact on cable advertising rates  including the rates for our inventory 
our scatter market inventory was sold at rates above rates in the scatter market and above the rates for inventory sold in the upfront 
additionally  direct response rates were down by compared to that inventory sold in the same period of although our cpms in were higher than in  our delivery of our key demographic  women  was substantially lower than prior periods 
our demographic delivery in was lower than in this lower demographic delivery more than offset gains in our cpms resulting in lower advertising revenue in compared to in the upfront process representing the sale of our inventory for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  we entered into agreements with major advertising firms representing approximately of our advertising inventory 
in the prior year upfront we sold approximately of our inventory 
the inventory was sold at cpms higher than the inventory sold in the upfront  including significant increases in rates related to our new lifestyle programming block 
the company will sell the balance of the general rate inventory for the broadcast season to advertisers that purchase upfront inventory on a calendar year basis  rather than an advertising year basis  and in the scatter marketplace 
additionally  we sold approximately of the hallmark movie channel available inventory in the upfront 
following the upfront period  sales of our general rate  direct response and paid programming inventory are made closer to the timing of the actual advertisement 
as compared to the upfront sales for the same periods  scatters rates in the third quarter of were higher 
advertisers with upfront contracts have an option to terminate their contracts  as well as an option to expand the amount of inventory purchased under the contracts 
in prior years  cancellations of upfront contracts were unusual 
during the twelve months period ended september comprising the broadcast season  advertisers canceled approximately of the inventory covered by such contracts 
the company sold the balance of the general rate inventory  including that resulting from the cancellations  in the scatter market 
the company was able to sell the martha stewart programming time block at rates higher than prior year rates during that same time block 
distribution agreements distribution agreements with multiple systems operators are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and the rates charged for advertising 
our long term distribution challenge will be obtaining favorable renewals of our major distribution agreements as they expire 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from september through december  inclusive of renewal options 
we renewed our agreement with national cable television cooperative nctc  on december  the nctc distribution agreement covers approximately of our total hallmark channel and of our hallmark movie channel subscribers 
the company agreement with at t expired on august  on september   the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel were dropped from at t platform because the 
table of contents parties had not agreed to the terms of a new distribution agreement 
as a result  the overall subscriber numbers for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
the company accounted for subscriber revenue earned through august   on an accrual basis 
a distribution agreement with cox ended on december  our channels continue to be distributed by cox under the terms of the expired agreement through two extensions to that agreement that expired on february   while renewal negotiations continue 
the cox distribution agreement covers approximately of our subscribers for the hallmark channel and of our subscribers for the hallmark movie channel 
the universe of cable and satellite tv subscribers in the united states is approximately million homes 
the top cable tv networks in the united states  measured by the number of subscribers  have million or more subscribers 
our goal is for the hallmark channel to reach million subscribers and the hallmark movie channel to reach million subscribers by the end of demographics as pay television channels draw audience share  audience demographics ie  viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  gender and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products by advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to however  the average median age of a viewer of the hallmark channel was in  and  in december  the total day average median age of viewers of the hallmark channel and hallmark movie channel was and  respectively 
in order to achieve our revenue goals  we need to draw in our target audience 
broadcasts of the martha stewart show and other martha stewart living productions on the hallmark channel  which commenced in september  are key parts of our efforts to attract our target audience over time 
for additional information on demographics and viewer ratings  please see sources of revenue advertising revenue in item  business  and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results 
revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees and advertising fees 
for the years ended december   and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and revenue from the sale of advertising time on our channels was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
information relating to subscriber fees and advertising fees is presented above in item business sources of revenue cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the amortization of program license fees  the cost of signal distribution  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
see the discussion of programming costs in results of operations below 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
when necessary  the company evaluates the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenue 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenue and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis blocks of time during the day as it pertains to programming licensed to a channel 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenue are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs are immediately recognized in the amount of the excess 
goodwill at december   the company had a stockholders deficit of million and a goodwill asset of million 
all of our goodwill relates to our channel operations segment  which is also our only reporting unit 
for the purpose of performing its annual goodwill impairment test  the company has included the book value of its redeemable preferred stock otherwise classified as mezzanine for financial reporting purposes in the calculation of business enterprise value bev 
we performed our annual impairment assessment for our goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets as of november using a market approach to determine fair value 
bev is equal to common equity at market value plus debt at market value plus preferred equity at market value less cash and cash equivalents 
we estimated the fair values of the term a and term b loans using discount rates of and  respectively 
we believe that the carrying value of the capitalized lease obligation is not materially different from its fair value  further  the effect of such difference  if any  is not material to the impairment test 
accordingly  we have used the carrying value 
the full million redemption value of the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred interest was paid to visn management corp 
on december   therefore  the fair market value as of november   was million 
we have valued our redeemable preferred stock at its liquidation preference based on a recent valuation 
we valued our common shares using the november  closing nasdaq stock price 
the estimated fair value determined in our initial impairment test was in excess of the reporting unit bev  and accordingly no additional testing was performed and no impairment charge was recorded 
we note that if our fair value estimate was lower  we would still not have failed the initial test and no impairment charge would be taken 

table of contents long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
revenue recognition subscriber revenue from pay television distributors is recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recorded net of amortization of subscriber acquisition costs 
advertising revenue  net of agency commissions  is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for the company broadcasting operations 
customers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue or audience deficiency units 
audience deficiency unit liability audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for the inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
an audience deficiency liability results when impressions delivered on guaranteed ratings are less than the impressions guaranteed to advertisers 
the liability is reduced when the company airs the advertisement during another program to make good on the under delivery of impressions 
the company typically does not remit cash to advertisers in satisfaction of such deficiencies 
contracts executed in the upfront period require that the company use its best efforts to run sufficient make good advertising spots within months to achieve the impressions guarantees 
if the company does not make good within months  the company is no longer obligated to satisfy the under delivery of the guaranteed impressions 
under previous contracts  the company did not have the obligation to satisfy under delivery of guaranteed impressions within months and approximately  of the company make good obligations simply lapsed in due to the expiration of the applicable state statute of limitations for contracts 
while the company now has an obligation to use its best efforts to make good on any under delivery of guaranteed impressions within months  it also has the benefit of being able to relieve the make good obligations earlier than it has been able to do historically

our revenue  comprised primarily of subscriber and advertising fees  increased million or in over our subscriber fee revenue increased million or due to increases in contractual rates and subscribers offset in part by on going negotiations with one distributor 
the amount of subscriber acquisition fees that was recorded as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
the million or increase in advertising revenue is primarily due to increases in cpms offset in part by declines in viewer ratings across demographic categories for compared to for  nielsen ranked the hallmark channel th in total day viewership with a household rating and th in primetime with a household rating among the cable channels in the united states market 
the ratings decline reduced the revenue from all inventory  including inventory used to satisfy deficiencies in audience delivery 
audience deficiency unit revenue decreased million from contra revenue of million for  to contra revenue of million for the same period in as a result of such ratings declines  leading to a corresponding decrease in revenue recognized by the company 
advertising revenue from the hallmark movie channel increased from million for to million for this is due to the increase in the number of subscribers as the company continues to expand distribution of this channel 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease results primarily from the effects of the million or decrease in programming costs  discussed below  and the increase in advertising revenue discussed above 
we may  however  incur additional programming related costs in the future to obtain high definition versions of certain of our programming 
operating costs for decreased million over due in part to the million decrease in bad debt expense 
the company bad debt expense was million for  as compared to  for the decrease in bad debt expense is primarily due to certain advertising customers experiencing cash flow problems under generally poor economic conditions during and being unable to make timely payments 
customer cash flow problems declined in and  therefore  payments were received on a timelier basis 
additionally  salary and termination expense decreased million and playback and transponder expense decreased million due to terminations of employment during second quarter of and standard definition provider contracts in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expense

as of december   management believes that fulfillment of its indemnification obligation will occur over a period longer than previously estimated 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company decreased the carrying amount of the liability by  and recognized a corresponding gain from sale of film assets in the accompanying statement of operations 
in december the company had concluded that payments under this obligation would occur generally later than originally estimated in december accordingly  the company reduced the carrying amount of the liability by  and recognized a corresponding gain from sale of film assets in the accompanying statement of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in as compared to due to the recapitalization 
income tax expense 
for tax purposes  the recapitalization generated net cancellation of debt income which is estimated at approximately million 
accordingly  the company is expected to generate federal and state taxable income for both regular tax and alternative minimum tax amt purposes 
for regular tax purposes  this income will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
however  for federal amt purposes  loss carryforwards can be used against amt income but are limited to of amt income 
as a result  the company has recorded an income tax expense of approximately million for the estimated amt in its consolidated statements of operations as it is not likely that any benefit of this amt as a credit carryforward will be realized 
additionally  for state tax purposes the company also has a tax expense 
effective october  california has suspended the use of tax loss carryovers for and also  the state of new york has an alternative minimum tax which allows only of the tax loss carryforwards 
the total federal and state tax provision is million

our revenue from continuing operations  comprised primarily of subscriber and advertising fees  decreased million or in over our subscriber fee revenue increased million or 
the amount of subscriber acquisition fees that was recorded as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
subscriber revenue increased in primarily due to an increase in the number of hallmark channel pay subscribers and small contractual rate increases 

table of contents the million or decrease in advertising revenue is primarily due to declines in viewer ratings across demographic categories for compared audience deficiency unit revenue decreased million from revenue of million for  to contra revenue of million for the same period in as a result of such ratings declines  leading to a corresponding decrease in revenue recognized by the company 
we believe that changes to our program schedule  along with increased competition including the availability of high definition distribution by competitors  contributed to a decline in ratings 
from until early  our programming schedule did not change significantly 
beginning in  a number of programs that had previously received strong ratings began to experience ratings declines  and we placed television series in certain timeslots instead of movies or original productions 
also  a number of programs in the schedule provided strong household ratings performance but less effective delivery of our key demographic  women age in  we began to introduce new content into the schedule with the objective of increasing the delivery of women the schedule changes likely resulted in some viewer confusion and did result in lower ratings 
the fact that hallmark channel was not broadcast in high definition may have had a negative impact on ratings in of the top advertising supported cable networks with a household rating or higher in prime time  only six of those networks including hallmark channel were not offered in high definition 
of those six networks  three experienced double digit ratings decreases in compared to and three experienced single digit increases 
in  of viewers with access to high definition programming services tuned to those high definition services first 
the growth in popularity of high definition programming is expected to continue in and beyond  and these high definition trends were part of our decision to launch hallmark channel in high definition in february the year also represented a year of increased competition within cable television 
the number of cable networks investing in original programming increased in  and acquired non original programming now represents only of prime time cable programming 
although hallmark channel continues to invest in original programming  our increase in investment for original content did not match the growth of the market or many of our competitors 
the impact of the programming competition is heightened by the continued growth of time shifting digital video recording devices  or dvr 
with the proliferation of these devices  viewers are able to increase their access to the new  compelling content 
for the year ended december   nielsen ranked the hallmark channel th in total day viewership with a household rating and th in primetime with a household rating among the cable channels in the united states market 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease results primarily from the effects of the decrease in programming costs  discussed below  offset in part by the decrease in advertising revenue discussed above 
programming costs decreased million or from in the second and third quarters of  we entered into agreements to amend significant programming agreements which added programs and deferred certain payments for programming content to periods beyond some of the agreements resulted in the extension of related program licenses to cover slightly longer periods of availability  the deferral of expected delivery of certain programming and the deferral of certain payments primarily from until upon the amendment of the agreements  we prospectively changed the amortization of program license fees for any changes in the period of expected usage and or changes in license fees 
the effects of these amendments on amortization were not significant 
additionally  we returned our exclusivity rights to one title  which resulted in a lower asset and liability balance 
during the first quarter of  we also entered into amendments to some of our original programming agreements which extended the current license period to those titles  and thus  
table of contents resulted in lower amortization in compared to additionally  during  we did not enter into any significant new third party license agreements  so expiring program rights and the related amortization were not replaced in full with assets and amortization from newer license agreements 
operating costs for increased million over due in part to the million increase in bad debt expense and the  of severance expense recorded in may related to one executive resignation 
the company bad debt expense was million for  as compared to  for the increase in bad debt expense is due to certain advertising customers experiencing cash flow problems under poor economic conditions 
additionally  the company recorded negative film amortization of  in that resulted principally from the company periodic reassessment and eventual payment of its liabilities for residuals and participations associated with the company third party licensing and self use of the company film library prior to the sale of the company international film rights in april and the company domestic film rights in december during the fourth quarter of  we negotiated the termination of two channel delivery agreements related to the launch of the hallmark channel into high definition 
the estimated costs of termination were approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense increased slightly year over year 
the company recorded million of severance expense associated with the resignation of its president on may  the company also recorded million of severance expense associated with the termination of employees in august these increases in expense were offset by decreases in the travel  communication  and rsu related expenses 
travel and communication events related expenses decreased approximately million period over period 
additionally  the company recorded million of compensation expense associated with rsus during  as compared to  of compensation benefit associated with rsus for see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report

the five marketing promotions were centered around the original movies the good witch in january  bridal fever in february  a gunfighter pledge in july  and both old fashioned thanksgiving and moonlight and mistletoe in november the company had one significant marketing promotion in january centered around the original movie  taking a chance on love 
as part of our contingency cost reduction efforts  promotional and marketing efforts were reduced overall during compared to gain from sale of film assets
