item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is management s analysis of the financial performance of sunoco  inc and subsidiaries collectively  sunoco or the company and of significant trends that may affect its future performance 
it should be read in conjunction with sunoco s consolidated financial statements and related notes under item those statements in management s discussion and analysis that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
overview historically  sunoco s profitability has primarily been determined by refined product and chemical margins and the reliability and efficiency of its operations 
the company has been repositioning its portfolio of businesses over the past few years to reduce its exposure to refining and chemicals margins through the sale of its tulsa refinery and its polypropylene operations 
in addition  there has been significant capital investment to grow the logistics and cokemaking operations 
as a result  sunoco s profitability has been increasingly impacted by the growth in the level of earnings in these businesses 
however  the volatility of crude oil  refined product and chemical prices and the overall supply demand balance for these commodities should continue to have a significant impact on margins and the financial results of the company 
refined product margins declined significantly in the first half of in response to record high crude oil prices and softening global demand  strengthened in the second half of due to supply disruptions in the gulf coast attributable to hurricanes gustav and ike and declining crude oil prices  then declined sharply once again in in response to weak demand attributable to the global recession 
during  refined product margins showed some slight improvement 
chemical margins were weak during most of the period in response to high feedstock costs and soft demand as a result of a weak economy 
during the period  cokemaking profitability benefited from increased price realizations from coke production at the company s jewell operations  which were largely driven by increases in coal prices  improved operations at its haverhill facility and a one time million investment tax credit in attributable to the startup of its new gateway facility 
the company believes the profitability of the refining and supply business will continue to be challenged in due to volatility in the global marketplace causing ongoing weakness in product demand as well as the general oversupply of refined products due to increases in worldwide production capacity 
the absolute level of refined product margins is difficult to predict as they are influenced by extremely volatile factors  including the absolute level of crude oil and other feedstock prices  changes in industry production capacity  the effects of weather conditions on product supply and demand and the status of the global economy 
furthermore  excess capacity  increasing biofuels mandates and environmental regulations continue to adversely impact the refining industry 
these factors may prevent refiners  including sunoco  from earning their cost of capital and may lead to industry plant closures in the future 
cokemaking profitability is expected to continue to be strong 
however  as a result of the restructuring of the coke supply agreements at jewell and haverhill effective january   its near term income will be lower and the impact of volatility of coal prices will be reduced 
the company s future operating results and capital spending plans will also be impacted by environmental matters see environmental matters below 
strategic actions sunoco is committed to improving its performance and enhancing its shareholder value while  at the same time  maintaining its financial strength and flexibility by striving to deliver excellence in health  safety and environmental performance  
table of contents increase reliability of company assets and realize additional operational improvements in each of its businesses  reduce expenses  efficiently manage capital spending to minimize outlays  diversify  upgrade and grow the company s asset base through strategic acquisitions and investments  divest assets that do not meet the company s return on investment criteria  and return cash to the company s shareholders primarily through the payment of cash dividends 
in the second quarter of  sunoco s board of directors authorized a plan to separate sunoco s metallurgical cokemaking business  which is managed by suncoke energy  from the remainder of sunoco 
sunoco s board and management believe that a separation of suncoke energy from the remainder of sunoco should enable sunoco to pursue a more focused strategic plan  invest in growth opportunities with an emphasis on retail marketing and logistics and further strengthen its balance sheet 
this should permit the company to enhance its competitive profile while becoming the premier provider of transportation fuels in its markets 
through a separation from sunoco  suncoke energy will be better positioned to serve its customers  the world s leading steel manufacturers  while also focusing on achieving its global growth potential 
as a leading independent coke producer in north america  suncoke energy s customer relationships  modern cokemaking assets and a leading proprietary technology should enable it to pursue these opportunities 
the separation will also provide suncoke energy independent access to capital markets to finance new domestic and international projects 
the separation of suncoke energy from sunoco is expected to be completed through a two step process 
sunoco has undertaken the following initiatives as part of this strategy and its aspiration to become the premier provider of transportation fuels in its markets refining and supply entered into an agreement in december to sell the toledo refinery and related inventory for approximately million consisting of million in cash proceeds and a million note plus crude oil and refined product inventory associated with the refinery which will be valued at market prices near the time of closing

current production volumes are contracted for sale through income millions of dollars coke production thousands of tons united states brazil coke segment income decreased million in primarily due to the absence of a one time million investment tax credit associated with the start up of the gateway facility in the fourth quarter of  and lower results from the jewell coal and coke and indiana harbor operations 
partially offsetting these negative factors were higher results from the haverhill and gateway operations which were driven by higher margins and volumes 
for  coke segment after tax income is expected to be approximately million excluding any potential financing costs associated with the planned separation 
this estimate reflects the impacts of the contract restructurings with arcelormittal described below  contracted coal prices of approximately per ton  the expected inability to meet contracted volumes at the indiana harbor facility and general and administrative costs associated with becoming a standalone entity and relocating the suncoke energy corporate office to the chicago area 
coke segment income increased million in primarily due to improved results from jewell operations largely associated with higher price realizations from coke production and the recognition of the one time million investment tax credit 
also contributing to the improvement was million of after tax dividend income from the brazilian cokemaking operations 
substantially all of the production from the jewell and indiana harbor facilities and approximately percent of the production from the haverhill facility is sold pursuant to long term contracts with affiliates of arcelormittal 
the technology and operating fees  as well as preferred dividends pertaining to the brazilian cokemaking operation  are payable to suncoke energy under long term contracts with a project company in which a brazilian subsidiary of arcelormittal is the major shareholder

suncoke energy and arcelormittal participated in court ordered mediation in january which resulted in a commercial resolution of these issues 
the parties agreed to amend the jewell and haverhill coke supply agreements effective january  to eliminate the fixed coal cost adjustment factor in the jewell agreement and increase the operating cost and fixed fee components payable to suncoke energy under both agreements 
the parties also agreed that volume under both contracts will remain take or pay through the end of the contracts in december rather than converting to requirements in the fourth quarter of this extension provides suncoke a guaranteed outlet for this coke production through if the amendments to the jewell and haverhill coke supply agreements had been in place during  suncoke s pretax earnings would have been reduced by approximately million

expenditures through december  totaled million 
in april  suncoke energy commenced a project to expand its coal production by approximately  tons per year to an annualized rate of approximately two million tons by late including production from its harold keene coal co  inc acquisition 
capital outlays for this project are expected to total approximately million 
suncoke energy is currently conducting an engineering study to evaluate the expected physical life of the coke ovens at its indiana harbor operation 
some ovens and associated equipment are heaving and settling differentially as a result of the instability of the ground on which it was constructed 
this differential movement has reduced production and required corrective action to certain ovens  ancillary equipment and structures 
higher maintenance costs are expected to continue as a result of this condition 
suncoke energy has completed a capital project to improve the stability of certain boiler supports and the emission shed supports  which previously had been damaged as a result of such differential movement 
in addition  an oven repair and maintenance program has been implemented to limit further deterioration to the ovens 
the engineering study at indiana harbor is expected to be completed during the first quarter of at this time  the likely outcome of the study cannot be determined 
possible results include additional maintenance spending to continue operations at the current operating levels  a change in the useful life of all or part of the plant  or the impairment of one or more oven batteries which could be followed by capital spending to retain the current plant capacity 
the carrying amount of the indiana harbor coke facility was million at december  suncoke energy is currently discussing other opportunities for developing new heat recovery cokemaking facilities with domestic and international steel companies 
such cokemaking facilities could be either wholly owned or developed through other business structures 
as applicable  the steel company customers would be expected to purchase coke production under long term contracts 
the facilities would also generate steam  which 
table of contents would typically be sold to the steel customer  or electrical power  which could be sold to the steel customer or into the local power market 
suncoke energy s ability to enter into additional arrangements is dependent upon market conditions in the steel industry

analysis of consolidated statements of operations revenues total revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in the percent increase in was primarily due to higher refined product prices as well as higher crude oil sales in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations 
partially offsetting these positive factors were lower refined product sales volumes

costs and expenses total pretax costs and expenses were billion in  billion in and billion in the percent increase in was primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product acquisition costs resulting from price increases and higher costs in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations 
partially offsetting these negative factors were lower crude oil and refined product acquisition volumes and lower provisions for asset write downs and other matters 
in  the percent decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product acquisition costs resulting from price declines and lower crude oil throughputs 
also contributing to the decline were lower crude oil costs in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations

the million increase in cash and cash equivalents in was due to million of cash generation and million of net cash provided by financing activities  partially offset by a million net use of cash in investing activities 
management believes that the current levels of cash and working capital are adequate to support sunoco s ongoing operations 
sunoco s working capital position is considerably stronger than indicated because of the relatively low historical costs assigned under the lifo method of accounting for most of the inventories reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the current replacement cost of all such inventories  including inventories classified as assets held for sale  exceeded their carrying value at december  by  million 

table of contents inventories valued at lifo  which consist primarily of crude oil and petroleum and chemical products  are readily marketable at their current replacement values 
the company received federal income tax refunds totaling million during for the carryback of its net operating loss 
certain pending legislative and regulatory proposals effectively could limit  or even eliminate  use of the lifo inventory method for financial and income tax purposes 
although the final outcome of these proposals cannot be ascertained at this time  the ultimate impact to sunoco of the transition from lifo to another inventory method could be material 
cash flows from operating activities in  sunoco s cash generation was  million compared to million in and million in the  million increase in cash generation in was primarily due to higher net income and a decrease in working capital levels pertaining to operating activities 
cash generation includes federal income tax refunds totaling million received by the company during for the carryback of its net operating loss 
partially offsetting these positive factors were cash contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans 
the million decrease in cash generation in was primarily due to a decrease in operating results  partially offset by a decrease in cash used to fund working capital levels and an increase in noncash charges 
increases in crude oil prices typically increase cash generation as the payment terms on sunoco s crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms on product sales 
conversely  decreases in crude oil prices typically result in a decline in cash generation 
crude oil prices have increased in and other cash flow information divestment activities also have been a source of cash 
during the period  proceeds from divestments totaled million and related primarily to the divestments of the polypropylene business in and the tulsa refinery and related inventory and the retail heating oil and propane distribution business in as well as the sale of retail gasoline outlets throughout the period

as a result of these transactions  sunoco s share of partnership distributions is expected to be approximately percent at the partnership s current quarterly cash distribution rate 
the partnership acquired interests in various pipelines and other logistics assets during the period see capital program below 
the partnership expects to finance future growth opportunities with a combination of borrowings and the issuance of additional limited partnership units to the public to maintain a balanced capital structure 
any issuance of limited partnership units to the public would dilute sunoco s ownership interest in the partnership 
financial capacity management currently believes that future cash generation is expected to be sufficient to satisfy sunoco s ongoing capital requirements  to fund its pension obligations see retirement benefit plans below and to pay cash dividends on sunoco s common stock 
however  from time to time  the company s short term cash requirements may exceed its cash generation due to various factors including

as a result of these changes  suncoke energy s postretirement medical liability declined approximately million during the first quarter of most of the benefit of this liability reduction will be amortized into income through environmental matters general sunoco is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  waste management and the characteristics and composition of fuels 
as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases the overall cost of operating sunoco s businesses  including remediation  operating costs and capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities 
existing laws and regulations have required  and are 
table of contents expected to continue to require  sunoco to make significant expenditures of both a capital and an expense nature 
the following table summarizes sunoco s expenditures for environmental projects and compliance activities in millions of dollars pollution abatement capital remediation operations  maintenance and administration capital expenditures for pollution abatement include amounts to comply with the consent decree pertaining to certain alleged clean air act violations at the company s refineries 
pollution abatement capital outlays are expected to approximate and million in and  respectively  excluding amounts attributable to the toledo refinery after the expected closing of the sale in the first quarter of and the marcus hook consent decree which may be delayed as a result of discussions with government environmental authorities 
remediation activities information regarding remediation activities at sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites is included in the discussion under environmental remediation activities in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
regulatory matters through the operation of its refineries  chemical plants  marketing facilities  coke plants and coal mines  sunoco s operations emit greenhouse gases ghg  including carbon dioxide 
there are various legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg emissions which are in various stages of review  discussion or implementation 
current proposals being considered by congress include cap and trade legislation and carbon taxation legislation 
one current cap and trade bill proposes a system that would begin in which would require the company to provide carbon emission allowances for emissions at its manufacturing facilities as well as emissions caused by the use of fuels it sells 
the cap and trade program would require affected businesses to buy emission credits from the government  other businesses or through an auction process 
the exact amount of such costs  as well as those that could result from any carbon taxation  would not be established until the future 
however  the company believes that these costs could be material  and there is no assurance that the company would be able to recover them in the sale of its products 
other federal and state actions to develop programs for the reduction of ghg emissions are also being considered 
in addition  during  the us environmental protection agency epa indicated that it intends to regulate carbon dioxide emissions 
while it is currently not possible to predict the impact  if any  that these issues will have on the company or the industry in general  they could result in increases in costs to operate and maintain the company s facilities  as well as capital outlays for new emission control equipment at these facilities 
in addition  regulations limiting ghg emissions or carbon content of products  which target specific industries such as petroleum refining or chemical or coke manufacturing could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business and also may reduce demand for its products 
national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and fine particles promulgated by the epa have resulted in identification of non attainment areas throughout the country  including texas  pennsylvania  and ohio  where sunoco operates facilities 
areas designated by the epa as moderate non attainment for ozone  including philadelphia and the houston galveston brazoria area  were required to meet the ozone requirements by before currently mandated federal control programs were to take effect 
in january  the epa issued a finding that the pennsylvania and texas state implementation plans sips failed to demonstrate attainment for the philadelphia and houston galveston brazoria airsheds by the deadline 
this finding is expected to result in more stringent offset requirements and could result in other negative consequences 
texas petitioned the epa to redesignate the houston area as severe non attainment for ozone and in the epa granted the petition 
under this designation  houston s sip was due in and attainment 
table of contents must be achieved by in  the epa also identified numerous counties  including the county where the toledo refinery is located  that are now in attainment of the fine particles standard 
in september  the epa issued a final rule tightening the standard for fine particles 
this standard is currently being challenged in federal court by various states and environmental groups 
in march  the epa issued final rules to implement the fine particle matter pm standards 
states had until april to submit plans to the epa demonstrating attainment by or  at the latest  however  the march rule does not address attainment of the september standard 
in march  the epa promulgated a new  more stringent ozone standard  which was challenged in a lawsuit in may by environmental organizations 
regulatory programs  when established to implement the epa s air quality standards  could have an impact on sunoco and its operations 
however  the potential financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated until the lawsuit is resolved  the epa promulgates regulatory programs to attain the standards  and the states  as necessary  develop and implement revised sips to respond to the new regulations 
mtbe litigation information regarding certain mtbe litigation in which sunoco is a defendant is included in the discussion under mtbe litigation in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
conclusion management believes that the environmental matters discussed above are potentially significant with respect to results of operations or cash flows for any one year 
however  management does not believe that such matters will have a material impact on sunoco s consolidated financial position or  over an extended period of time  on sunoco s cash flows or liquidity 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk sunoco uses swaps  options  futures  forwards and other derivative instruments to hedge a variety of commodity price risks 
derivative instruments are used from time to time to achieve ratable pricing of crude oil purchases  to convert certain expected refined product sales to fixed or floating prices  to lock in what sunoco considers to be acceptable margins for various refined products and to lock in the price of a portion of the company s electricity and natural gas purchases or sales and transportation costs 
sunoco does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
sunoco is at risk for possible changes in the market value of all of its derivative contracts  however  such risk would be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged items 
at december   sunoco had accumulated net derivative deferred losses  before income taxes  of less than million on all of its open derivative contracts 
open contracts as of december  vary in duration but generally do not extend beyond sunoco also is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by derivative counterparties 
management believes this risk is not significant as the company has established credit limits with such counterparties which require the settlement of net positions when these credit limits are reached 
as a result  the company had no significant derivative counterparty credit exposure at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
interest rate risk sunoco has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its outstanding borrowings 
sunoco manages this exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate 
table of contents debt 
at december   the company had  million of fixed rate debt and million of floating rate debt 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s fixed rate borrowings at december  by approximately million 
however  such change in interest rates would not have a material impact on income or cash flows as the majority of the outstanding borrowings consisted of fixed rate instruments 
sunoco also has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its retirement benefit plans see critical accounting policies retirement benefit liabilities below 
sunoco generally does not use derivatives to manage its market risk exposure to changing interest rates 
dividends and share repurchases the company has paid cash dividends regularly on a quarterly basis since the company reduced the quarterly cash dividend paid on its common stock from 
per share per year to 
per share 
per year beginning with the first quarter of the company had previously increased the quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share beginning with the second quarter of the company s management believes that sunoco s current dividend level is sustainable under current conditions 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock in the open market in and in  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million 
at december   the company had a remaining authorization from its board to repurchase up to million of company common stock 
additional repurchases of company stock will be dependent on prevailing market conditions  available cash and the attractiveness of repurchasing stock relative to other investment alternatives 
the company currently has no plans to repurchase any of its common stock during critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements item 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of sunoco s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of retirement benefit liabilities  long lived assets  environmental remediation activities and deferred income taxes 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared at any point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
management has reviewed the assumptions underlying its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of sunoco s board of directors 
retirement benefit liabilities sunoco has substantial obligations in connection with its funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
effective june   benefits under these plans were frozen for most participants 
in addition  sunoco has postretirement benefit plans which provide health care benefits for substantially all of its current retirees 
medical benefits under these plans were also phased down or eliminated for all employees retiring after july  there are no planned changes in benefits for current retirees 
the postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and the costs are shared by sunoco and its retirees 
the levels of required retiree contributions to these plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
in addition  there is a dollar cap on sunoco s future contributions for its principal postretirement health care benefits plan  which significantly reduces the impact of future cost increases on the estimated postretirement benefit expense and benefit obligation 

table of contents suncoke energy also amended its postretirement plans during the first quarter of postretirement medical benefits for its future retirees will be phased out or eliminated  effective january   for most non mining employees with less than ten years of service on january  and employer costs for all those still eligible for such benefits have been capped 
the principal assumptions that impact the determination of both expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s pension plans are the discount rate and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate and the health care cost trend are the principal assumptions that impact the determination of both expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s postretirement health care benefit plans 
the discount rates used to determine the present value of future pension payments and medical costs are based on a portfolio of high quality aa rated corporate bonds with maturities that reflect the estimated duration of sunoco s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the present values of sunoco s future pension and other postretirement obligations were determined using discount rates of and percent  respectively  at december  and and percent  respectively  at december  sunoco s expense under these plans is generally determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year  or using a weighted average rate when curtailments  settlements and or other events require a plan remeasurement 
the weighted average discount rate for pension plans was percent for  percent for and percent for  and will be percent as of january   and for postretirement plans was percent for  percent for  percent for  and will be percent as of january  the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was assumed to be percent for each of the last three years 
a long term expected rate of return of percent on plan assets is also expected to be used to determine sunoco s pension expense for the expected rate of return on plan assets is estimated utilizing a variety of factors including the historical investment return achieved over a long term period  the targeted allocation of plan assets and expectations concerning future returns in the marketplace for both equity and fixed income securities 
in determining pension expense  the company applies the expected rate of return to the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year  which is determined using a quarterly average of plan assets from the preceding year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption 
it generally will differ from the actual annual return which is subject to considerable year to year variability 
for  the pension plan assets generated a positive return of percent  compared to a positive return of in and a negative return of percent in for the year period ended december   the compounded annual investment return on sunoco s pension plan assets was a positive return of percent 
as permitted by existing accounting rules  the company does not recognize currently in pension expense the difference between the expected and actual return on assets 
rather  the difference along with other actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plans primarily the discount rate and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
except as discussed below  if such actuarial gains and losses on a cumulative basis exceed percent of the projected benefit obligation  the excess is amortized into net income as a component of pension or postretirement benefits expense generally over the average remaining service period of plan participants still employed with the company  which currently is approximately years for the pension plans and approximately years for the postretirement benefit plans 
at december   the accumulated net actuarial loss for defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans was and million  respectively 
sunoco is also required to accelerate the recognition of a portion of its cumulative actuarial losses into net income if the amount of pension liabilities settled in a given year is greater than the service and interest cost components of its defined benefit plans expense 
as a result of the workforce reduction  the sale of the tulsa refinery  the permanent shutdown of the eagle point refinery and the sale of the polypropylene chemicals business  the company incurred noncash settlement losses totaling and million with respect to its defined benefit plans in and  respectively 
in addition  as a result of the above noted changes  the service cost and interest on the existing defined benefit pension plan obligations have declined 
this reduction in service and interest cost will also increase the likelihood that settlement gains or losses  representing the 
table of contents accelerated amortization of deferred gains and losses  will be recognized in the future as previously earned lump sum payments are made 
sunoco has unrecognized prior service benefits related to its postretirement benefit plans of million at december  which is primarily attributable to the phase down or elimination of retiree medical benefits described above 
most of the benefit of this liability reduction will be amortized into income through the initial health care cost trend assumptions used to compute the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were increases of percent  percent and percent at december   and  respectively 
these trend rates were assumed to decline gradually to percent in and to remain at that level thereafter 
set forth below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement benefits expense and benefit obligations that would occur in from a change in the indicated assumptions dollars in millions change in rate expense benefit obligations pension benefits decrease in the discount rate decrease in the long term expected rate of return on plan assets postretirement benefits decrease in the discount rate increase in the annual health care cost trend rates represents the projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for postretirement benefit plans 
long lived assets the cost of plants and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
changes in useful lives that do not result in the impairment of an asset are recognized prospectively 
there have been no significant changes in the useful lives of the company s plants and equipment during the period 
a decision to dispose of an asset may necessitate an impairment review 
if the criteria of assets held for sale are met  an impairment would be recognized for any excess of the aggregate carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the disposal group over their fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets  other than those held for sale  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for the company s products or in end use goods manufactured by others utilizing the company s products as raw materials  changes in the company s business plans or those of its major customers  suppliers or other business partners  changes in competition and competitive practices  uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies  changes in the expected level of capital  operating or environmental remediation expenditures  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
additional factors impacting the economic viability of long lived assets are described under forward looking statements below 
a long lived asset that is not held for sale is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
such estimated future cash flows 
table of contents are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions 
the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the impaired asset 
it is also difficult to precisely estimate fair market value because quoted market prices for the company s long lived assets may not be readily available 
therefore  fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets being reviewed for impairment 
sunoco had asset impairments totaling  and million after tax during  and  respectively 
the impairments in related primarily to additional asset write downs attributable to a decline in the fair market value of certain assets of the eagle point refinery which was permanently shut down in the fourth quarter of the impairments in related primarily to the write down to estimated fair value of the eagle point refinery as well as the write down of certain other assets primarily in the refining and supply business 
estimates of the fair market value of the eagle point assets utilized in and were largely based upon an independent appraiser s use of observable current replacement costs of similar new equipment adjusted to reflect the age  condition  maintenance history and estimated remaining useful life 
as such  it reflected both observable and unobservable inputs and was therefore determined to be a level fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy under generally accepted accounting principles 
the impairments in related to the discontinued tulsa refining operations  which were sold on june   a polypropylene plant in bayport  tx which was permanently shut down in march  goodwill related to the company s polypropylene business  and certain retail marketing properties held for sale in the company s retail portfolio management program 
for a further discussion of these asset impairments  see note to the consolidated financial statements item 
the toledo refinery assets included in the disposal group  consisting primarily of refinery assets  crude oil  refined product and materials and supplies inventories and goodwill  were classified as held for sale at december  the aggregate fair value less cost to sell exceeded the related carrying amount of the disposal group and  as a result  no impairment was recognized 
the estimated fair value of the disposal group was based upon the expected proceeds as indicated in the toledo sales agreement 
sunoco also conducted impairment tests for its phenol chemical assets during the impairment test was prepared based upon sunoco s best estimate of future operating cash flows from its phenol plants over their expected useful lives 
the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows was prepared based upon the company s operating plan for the next three years and margins realized during the most recent six year business cycle 
while the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts of the assets  the margin was relatively narrow 
given the sensitivity of the most recent impairment test  if phenol sales volumes and margins do not return to their historical levels  a significant writedown of the phenol assets could be required 
the carrying amount of the phenol facilities was million at december  suncoke energy is currently conducting an engineering study to evaluate the expected physical life of the coke ovens at its indiana harbor operation 
some ovens and associated equipment are heaving and settling differentially as a result of the instability of the ground on which it was constructed 
this differential movement has reduced production and required corrective action to certain ovens  ancillary equipment and structures 
higher maintenance costs are expected to continue as a result of this condition 
suncoke energy has completed a capital project to improve the stability of certain boiler supports and the emission shed supports  which previously had been damaged as a result of such differential movement 
in addition  an oven repair and maintenance program has been implemented to limit further deterioration to the ovens 
the engineering study at indiana harbor is expected to be completed during the first quarter of at this time  the likely outcome of the study cannot be determined 
possible results include additional maintenance spending to continue operations at the current operating levels  a change in the useful life of all or part of the plant  or the impairment of one or more oven batteries which could be followed by capital spending to retain the current plant capacity 
the carrying amount of the indiana harbor coke facility was million at december  
table of contents environmental remediation activities sunoco is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  waste management and the characteristics and composition of fuels 
these laws and regulations require environmental assessment and or remediation efforts at many of sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites 
sunoco s accrual for environmental remediation activities amounted to million at december  this accrual is for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
the accrual is undiscounted and is based on currently available information  estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
it is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations  changing technologies and their associated costs  and changes in the economic environment 
in the above instances  if a range of probable environmental cleanup costs exists for an identified site  existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued unless some other point in the range is more likely  in which case the most likely amount in the range is accrued 
engineering studies  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities 
losses attributable to unasserted claims are also reflected in the accruals to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
management believes it is reasonably possible ie  less than probable but greater than remote that additional environmental remediation losses will be incurred 
at december   the aggregate of the estimated maximum additional reasonably possible losses  which relate to numerous individual sites  totaled approximately million 
however  the company believes it is very unlikely that it will realize the maximum reasonably possible loss at every site 
furthermore  the recognition of additional losses  if and when they were to occur  would likely extend over many years and  therefore  likely would not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
management believes that none of the current remediation locations  which are in various stages of ongoing remediation  is individually material to sunoco as its largest accrual for any one superfund site  operable unit or remediation area was approximately million at december  as a result  sunoco s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material 
however  if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur  such changes could impact multiple sunoco facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites at the same time 
as a result  from time to time  significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur 
under various environmental laws  including rcra  sunoco has initiated corrective remedial action at its facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites 
at the company s major manufacturing facilities  sunoco has consistently assumed continued industrial use and a containment remediation strategy focused on eliminating unacceptable risks to human health or the environment 
the remediation accruals for these sites reflect that strategy 
accruals include amounts to prevent off site migration and to contain the impact on the facility property  as well as to address known  discrete areas requiring remediation within the plants 
activities include closure of rcra solid waste management units  recovery of hydrocarbons  handling of impacted soil  mitigation of surface water impacts and prevention of off site migration 
many of sunoco s current terminals are being addressed with the above containment remediation strategy 
at some smaller or less impacted facilities and some previously divested terminals  the focus is on remediating discrete interior areas to attain regulatory closure 
sunoco owns or operates certain retail gasoline outlets where releases of petroleum products have occurred 
federal and state laws and regulations require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites and at 
table of contents formerly owned sites be assessed and remediated to meet the applicable standards 
the obligation for sunoco to remediate this type of contamination varies  depending on the extent of the release and the applicable laws and regulations 
a portion of the remediation costs may be recoverable from the reimbursement fund of the applicable state  after any deductible has been met 
in summary  total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon  among other things  the identification of any additional sites  the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site  the timing and nature of required remedial actions  the nature of operations at each site  the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements  the nature and terms of cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the availability of insurance coverage  the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations  inflation rates  terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of sunoco s liability at the sites  if any  in light of the number  participation level and financial viability of the other parties 
deferred income taxes the company recognizes benefits in income and related deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards nols and tax credit carryforwards 
if necessary  a charge to income and a related valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized by the company in the future 
deferred income tax assets attributable to state nols and federal tax credit carryforwards totaling million net of federal income tax effects and million  respectively  have been recognized in sunoco s consolidated balance sheet as of december  the state nols begin to expire in with a substantial portion expiring in and  while million of the federal tax credit carryforwards expires in and the balance has no expiration date 
the company has determined that a valuation allowance totaling million net of federal income tax effects is required for the state nols at december  primarily due to significant restrictions on their use in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
no valuation allowance has been established for the federal tax credit carryforwards 
in making the assessment of the realizability of the state nols and federal tax credit carryforwards  the company relies on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income based on historical and projected future operating results 
the potential need for valuation allowances is regularly reviewed by management 
if it is more likely than not that the recorded asset will not be realized  additional valuation allowances which increase income tax expense may be recognized in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made 
new accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements requiring adoption subsequent to december   that would have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
