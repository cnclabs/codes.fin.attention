overview we provide scientific services  products and technologies focused on improving the quality of life while delivering excellence  value and maximum return to our shareholders 
our core business consists of contract drug discovery  development and manufacturing services 
in addition to our contract services  we also have a separate  strategic technology division consisting of proprietary technology investments  internal drug discovery and niche generic active pharmaceutical ingredient product development 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front and service fees  and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
our proprietary research and development activities previously led us to license the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from the amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor patents and technology identified in one of our proprietary research programs to bristol myers squibb company bms  in october in addition  these activities also led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business and million from royalties on sales of allegra telfast 
we used million in cash from operations  and we used million  net of cash acquired for the acquisitions of amri uk and amri burlington during  along with million in capital expenditures on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to international expansion and maintenance of existing facilities 
we recorded a net loss of million in  largely the result of a million goodwill impairment charge  a million arbitration charge  an million long lived asset impairment charge and a million restructuring charge 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt 
strategy we provide contract services to many of the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we derive our contract revenue from research and development expenditures and commercial manufacturing demands of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry 
we continue to execute our long term strategy to develop and grow an integrated global platform from which we can provide these services 
we have research and or manufacturing facilities in the united states  hungary  singapore  india and the united kingdom 
in  we completed the construction of a  square foot research center focusing primarily on custom synthesis and medicinal chemistry support services at the shapoorji pallonji biotech park in hyderabad  india 
we enhanced our large scale manufacturing capabilities with our acquisitions of large scale manufacturing facilities in india in and and then completed a modernization and expansion of our pilot plant facility at this location in additionally in  we completed a  square foot expansion of our singapore research center  which not only increased existing discovery service capabilities  but also included the introduction of in vitro biology services at the facility 
in  we completed the expansion of our bothell  washington and budapest  hungary facilities 
in  we expanded our facility space at both our hyderabad  india and singapore locations and we have recently planned to further expand these sites 
in february  we acquired excelsyn ltd 
amri uk  which we believe is a well recognized leader in providing chemical development and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical industry in europe 
in june  we acquired amri burlington  a formulation company whose capabilities include cgmp manufacturing and sterile filling of parenteral drugs 
amri burlington provides high value added contract manufacturing services in sterile syringe and vial filling using specialized technologies 
amri burlington provides these services for both small molecule drug products and biologicals  from clinical phase to commercial scale 
we continue to integrate our research and manufacturing facilities worldwide  increasing our access to key global markets and enabling us to provide our customers with a flexible combination of high quality services and competitive cost structures to meet their individual outsourcing needs 
we seek comprehensive research and or supply agreements with our customers  incorporating several of our service offerings and spanning across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process 
our research facilities provide discovery  chemical development  analytical  and small scale current good manufacturing practices cgmp manufacturing services 
compounds discovered and or developed in our research facilities can then be more easily transitioned to production at our large scale manufacturing facilities for use in clinical trials and  ultimately  commercial sales if the product meets regulatory approval 
additionally  the acquisition of amri burlington provides our company with entry into a new and strategically important product offering 
we offer customers a fully integrated manufacturing process for sterile injectable drugs including the development and manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api  the design of the criteria to formulate the api into an injectable drug product  and the manufacture of the final drug product 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider of pharmaceutical research and development services from discovery through commercial production is of significant benefit to our customers 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
our global platform has increased our market penetration and was developed in order to allow us to maintain and grow margins 
in addition to our globalization  we continue to implement process efficiencies  including our continued efforts of process improvement and cost savings measures  along with efforts to strengthen our sourcing 
we believe these factors will lead to improved margins 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds and underlying technology to third parties in return for up front and service fees and milestone payments  as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
research and development is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
beginning in and continuing through  we experienced increased demand in the areas of developmental and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  reflecting a reduction in budgetary constraints of our emerging pharmaceutical and biotech customers and their increased efforts to bring identified compounds into clinical trials 
during this timeframe  partly in recognition of increased competition and consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry  we established lower cost international operations in hungary  singapore and india 
contract service providers that were not able to offer a cost competitive product were forced to exit or significantly reduce their presence in the marketplace during this time 
in addition to providing customers with a range of technologies and cost options  expanding internationally has provided increased access to customers and potential customers in regions of the world which we had not significantly pursued 
in addition to this growth in development and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  we had also seen an increased trend in demand for our discovery service as we increased our ability to provide high quality services under a variety of business models and cost structures by incorporating our international facilities 
in and continuing through  we experienced a decrease in customer delivery patterns and demand caused by the economic downturn 
as the industry emerges from this economic downturn  we believe that market pressures will exert an increasing trend toward outsourcing  primarily by large pharmaceutical companies as they seek to reduce their internal r d resources in favor of a variable cost model that offers lower cost  high quality alternatives to meet their drug discovery and development needs 
we have integrated our drug discovery and development research facilities with our large scale manufacturing facilities to allow for the easier transition throughout the entire pharmaceutical research and development process 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
we continue to build on our strategy of expanding and leveraging our global resources to meet changing and expanding global outsourcing needs  as evidenced by our recent and planned additional expansions of our international locations and with our acquisitions of amri uk and amri burlington  which provide entry into the european development and manufacturing markets and incorporates sterile fill and finish capabilities into our service offerings  respectively 
results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates  sterile syringe and vial filling  and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing 
api manufacturing is performed at our rensselaer facility and is in compliance with cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the same period in this result is primarily due to a decrease in contract revenue caused by lower demand from specialty pharma biotech customers for our us services  offset in part by the acquisition of amri uk along with higher demand for these services at our international locations  including an increased demand for our in vitro biology services worldwide 
we currently expect dds contract revenue for full year to slightly increase from amounts recognized in lsm contract revenue for the year ended december  increased from the same period in primarily due to incremental revenues from the amri uk and amri burlington acquisitions taking place in the first half of additionally  sales of commercial products increased million  primarily due to an increase in commercial sales to lsm s largest customer  as they return toward historical levels after reducing their purchases from us in in an effort to reduce their inventory levels 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of million related to reduced demand for the production of clinical supply materials 
we currently expect lsm contract revenue for full year to significantly increase from amounts recognized in dds contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to the same period in this result is primarily due to a decrease in contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services of million caused by lower demand from specialty pharma biotech customers and more competitive pricing in the overall current economic downturn 
in addition  discovery services contract revenue decreased million due primarily to the completion of revenue recognition in october related to the licensing and funded research component of our on going collaboration with bms and the completion of recognition of access fees related to the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration 
the decrease was also due to lower customer demand for services performed at our international locations  offset in part by an increase in us medicinal chemistry demand 
lsm contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million from the same period in primarily due to decreases in demand from lsm s largest customer and timing of customer requirements of million  a decrease of million related to reduced demand for clinical supply materials  as well as production interruptions at our international facility 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in commercial sales of million  resulting from an increase in demand for existing commercial products  along with shipments of an additional commercial product in recurring royalties we earn royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in thousands recurring royalties  which are based on the worldwide sales of allegra telfast  as well as on sales of sanofi aventis authorized generics  remained flat for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in recurring royalties increased million for the year ended december  from the same period in primarily due to an increase in international sales of allegra by sanofi aventis as well as the addition of royalties on the sale of authorized generics by teva  an increased royalty rate on one allegra product and the recognition of sublicensing fees received under the amended agreement with sanofi aventis 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings and operating cash flows 
we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
we forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as patent infringement litigation progresses 
milestone revenue milestone revenue is earned for achieving certain milestones included in licensing and research agreements with certain customers 
milestone revenues were as follows year ended december  in thousands no milestone revenue was recorded during the year ended december  during the year ended december   milestone revenue of million was recognized in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
million was recognized as a result of the submission of a clinical trial application and an additional million was recognized for advancing a third compound into preclinical development 
during the year ended december   the company recognized million of milestone revenue in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
a million milestone payment was triggered by bms s submission of an application to the health products and food branch hpfb  health canada to initiate phase clinical studies on a compound 
an additional million was recognized for advancing a second compound into preclinical development under the same agreement with bms 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  as well as chemicals  depreciation and other indirect project related costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds gross margin lsm gross margin total gross margin dds contract revenue gross margin decreased for the year ended december  from the same period in this decrease resulted from lower demand for our u 
s services in relation to our fixed costs 
we currently expect dds contract margins for to approximate amounts recognized in lsm s contract revenue gross margin decreased from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to lower revenues at our burlington facility in relation to its fixed cost base due to the pending resolution of its fda warning letter  along with unutilized capacity at our amri uk facility 
we currently expect lsm contract margins for to improve from amounts recognized in to slightly below margins recognized in dds had contract revenue gross margin of for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in this decrease resulted from lower demand for these services in relation to our fixed costs  as well as the completion of the recognition of revenue and access fees associated with the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration project at our bothell research facility and the completion of the recognition of revenue from the licensing and funded research components of our on going collaboration with bms 
additionally  this decrease was further caused by soft customer demand at our european and asian locations 
lsm s contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to decreased plant utilization as a result of order reductions by our largest customer in  as well as delays in nda submissions and approvals for customer materials that were queued up for production 
additionally  the decrease was further related to non cash inventory write downs primarily related to slower moving quantities of a legacy generic product of million 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology developments by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor or made a significant intellectual contribution 
to date  the royalties from allegra are the main driver of the awards 
accordingly  as the creator of the technology  the award is currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  our chief executive officer and president of the company 
the incentive awards were as follows year ended december  in thousands we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
technology incentive award expense for the year ended december  remained consistent as compared to  which reflects the relative consistency in royalty revenue 
technology incentive award expense for the year ended december  increased as compared to due to the increase in recurring royalties for the same period as discussed above 
research and development research and development r d expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology r d projects  costs of chemicals  materials  outsourced activities and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs 
we utilize our expertise in integrated drug discovery to perform our internal r d projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  r d is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses decreased from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs in caused by a reduction of research and development scientific resources and lower material costs  as we managed our costs by focusing on moving only our most advanced programs forward 
additionally  in we recognized an increase in process r d related to both improving the manufacturing process for our generic api products as well as the manufacturing process for our oncology compound  which was in phase i clinical trials 
we currently expect r d expense to decrease in from amounts recognized in  as we strategically manage our r d investments and continue to narrow the focus of r d spending on only the most advanced development programs 
projecting completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our proprietary amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor program  which was our most advanced project at that time  was licensed to bms in october in exchange for up front license fees  contracted research services  and the rights to future milestone and royalty payments 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  irritable bowel syndrome  obesity  and cns  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
we budget and monitor our r d expenses by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  our r d expenses are not tracked by project as they often benefit multiple projects in our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded r d expense summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from the same period in the increase in r d expense during the year ended december  was due primarily to improving the manufacturing process for our generic api products and by the continued establishment of r d activities at our singapore facility  including in vitro biology research capabilities 
the increase was further due to the advancement of our oncology compound through phase i clinical trials and the transition of research staff to our mch obesity research program upon completion of the funded component of the collaboration with bms 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional service fees  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
sg a expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  from the same period in the increase is primarily due to transaction costs associated with the amri uk and amri burlington acquisitions in the first half of  as well as incremental sg a costs from these new operations 
these increases were partially offset by cost savings from reorganization of our us locations in may and our large scale india operations in december sg a expenses for are expected to remain flat from amounts recognized in as one time acquisition charges and amri burlington remediation costs are reduced  offset by run rate impact from the acquisitions as well some investment in global capabilities on both sales and it fronts 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these decreases are primarily attributable to overall cost savings measures in  including incremental cost savings from our restructuring of our hungary operations and additionally from a reorganization of our large scale india operations 
goodwill impairment year ended december  in thousands we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value during the fourth quarter of the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several events occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance for this segment 
our amri uk facility was notified of an unplanned elimination in demand for a key commercial product  which has historically represented a significant amount of annual revenues at the site 
significant demand for this product is not expected to return until in addition  the fda warning letter issued to our amri burlington facility is expected to have both continued negative short term financial impact during the remediation process  as well as delaying the planned integration of the amri burlington business into our overall lsm platform and the forecasted resulting growth in the long term 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value 
the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several issues occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance 
two phase iii products that were expected to receive fda approval were delayed  one by the fda requiring more information and one by the customer in an effort to proactively collect more data before submitting to the fda 
it was expected throughout that commercial manufacturing would commence on both these products at the amri rensselaer lsm facility beginning in this has now been delayed to at least in addition  the company was notified of additional unexpected reductions in demand for product under the commercial supply agreement with its largest customer 
these additional unplanned demand reductions in the fourth quarter added an element of risk related to the company s ability to achieve the significant revenues expected from this contract that were reflected in the future projections for the segment 
property and equipment impairment year ended december  in thousands in the second quarter of  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charges of million in our dds segment 
as a result of realigning some of the amri us operating activities  the company evaluated the future economic benefit expected to be generated from the revised operating activities in this facility against the carrying value of the facility s property and equipment and determined that these assets were impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of million in our lsm segment upon determining that the carrying value of certain assets at our amri india location used in the manufacturing of generic products was not recoverable based on projections of future revenues and cash flows expected to be derived from the use of these assets 
restructuring charges restructuring charges are included under the caption restructuring charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued long term restructuring on the consolidated balance sheet at december  and the following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balances for and as of december  balance at january  charges reversals paid amounts foreign currency translation adjustments balance at december  termination benefits and personnel realignment lease termination charges losses on grant contracts facility and other costs administrative costs associated with restructuring total termination benefits and personnel realignment costs relate to severance packages  outplacement services  and career counseling for employees affected by this restructuring

facility and other costs are charges associated with consolidating into other nearby company locations 
anticipated cash outflows related to the restructuring for is approximately the details of the restructuring activity displayed in the table above are as follows amri us in may  we initiated a restructuring of our amri us locations 
as part of our strategy to increase global competitiveness and continue to be diligent in managing costs  we implemented cost reduction activities at our operations in the us these cost reduction activities included a reduction in the us workforce  as well as the suspension of operations at one of our research laboratory facilities in rensselaer  new york 
employees and equipment from this facility were consolidated into other nearby company operations 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in this charge includes lease termination charges of million net of estimated sublease income  termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of million and facility and other costs of million 
this restructuring activity was recorded within our dds operating segment 
amri india in december  we initiated a restructuring of our amri india locations which consisted of closing and consolidating our mumbai administrative office into our hyderabad location as part of our goal to streamline operations and eliminate duplicate administrative functions 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  including lease termination charges of million  leasehold improvement abandonment charges of million and administrative costs of less than million 
the amri india restructuring activity was recorded in our lsm operating segment 
amri hungary in may  we initiated a restructuring of our hungary location 
the goal of the restructuring was to realign the business model for these operations to better support our long term strategy for providing discovery services in the european marketplace 
during august  we closed and consolidated our balaton  hungary facility into the new facility in budapest  hungary as part of our goal to streamline operations and to consolidate locations  equipment and operating costs 
as a result of these restructurings  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million in and million in these restructuring charges included termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of approximately million  lease termination charges of million  losses on grant contracts of approximately million and administrative costs associated with the restructuring plan of million 
the hungary restructuring activity was recorded in our dds operating segment 
arbitration charge on august   amri rensselaer notified one of its suppliers that it was cancelling a purchase agreement between the parties pursuant to a hardship clause of the agreement 
amri rensselaer took the position that the cancellation was a valid and effective termination of the agreement under its terms while our supplier contended that the cancellation constituted repudiation of the contract for which they could recover damages 
our supplier commenced arbitration in september with international centre for dispute resolution icdr seeking damages for amri rensselaer s alleged wrongful repudiation of the agreement in the total amount of million  consisting of million as lost profit and million as labor cost 
on october  the icdr issued an arbitration award in favor of our supplier against amri rensselaer 
the arbitrator awarded our supplier damages of million plus interest at the rate of starting from august  amri accrued million for the award and related interest expense in the quarter ended september  on march   amri and our supplier entered into a settlement and supply agreement agreement which serves to settle the arbitral award and other legal proceedings related to the arbitral award that are now pending 
the agreement requires amri to pay million to our supplier and provide a cash collateralized letter of credit to secure the remainder of the arbitral award plus accrued interest 
the letter of credit will reduce quarterly based on certain volume purchase milestones 
the agreement also re establishes the supply relationship between amri and our supplier through with mutually beneficial terms 
as the letter of credit is reduced  the company will be able to reduce the allocated portion of the accrued charge taken in the quarter ended september  the maximum amount to be reversed is million through interest income  net year ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income interest income  net interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in due to the decrease of interest rates on our outstanding debt 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in due to the decrease of interest rates on our outstanding debt 
interest income decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held during the year 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates earned on interest bearing investments during  along with decreases in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held during the year 
other expense income  net year ended december  in thousands other expense for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the same period in this difference is primarily due to fluctuations in rates associated with foreign currency transactions 
other expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to other income of million for the same period in this difference is primarily due to a net loss in associated with our foreign currency transactions as compared to a net gain in additionally  in  we recorded greater losses on disposal of fixed assets as compared with income tax benefit expense year ended december  in thousands income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax benefit of million for the same period in this increase in income tax benefit is due to an increase in pre tax loss  offset by a correction of prior year deferred tax assets  which resulted in additional income tax expense of million 
we currently expect our effective tax rate for to be of pre tax income 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax expense of million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate of of pre tax loss for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the establishment of valuation reserves on certain net operating loss carry forwards 
the company s effective tax rate of of pre tax income for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the recapture of tax credits derived from certain of the company s r d expenses and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions  which were resolved in liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows and proceeds from borrowings 
during  we used cash of million for operating activities 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues and operating cash flows 
as part of a settlement with teva pharmaceuticals  the company received an upfront sublicense fee from sanofi aventis of million in  and sanofi aventis will pay royalties to the company on the sale of products in the united states containing fexofenadine hydrochloride the generic name for the active ingredient in allegra and products containing fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride generic allegra d by teva pharmaceuticals through  along with additional consideration 
teva pharmaceuticals launched a generic version of allegra d in november as part of our amended licensing agreement with sanofi aventis  we received quarterly royalties through july for the branded allegra d equal to the royalties paid for the quarter ended june  thereafter  the royalty rate has reverted to the rate in effect prior to the signing of the sub license amendment and we also receive a royalty on teva pharmaceuticals sales of generic allegra d 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  resulting primarily from the use of million for the acquisition of amri uk in february and million for the acquisition of amri burlington  net of cash acquired in june  along with million for the acquisition of property and equipment 
these uses were offset in part by million for net proceeds from investment securities 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in june working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million as of december   compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to cash of used for the acquisitions of amri burlington and amri uk  million used for capital expenditures and million used for the stock repurchase 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to international expansion and maintenance of our existing facilities 
for  we expect to incur to million in capital expenditures primarily relating to international expansion of existing facilities 
we currently have a revolving line of credit in the amount of million which has a maturity date in june the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on our company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the line of credit was million  bearing interest at a rate of 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and a minimum current ratio  as amended 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december   we were not in compliance with our covenants under the credit facility  however we received a waiver from our lender through april  while we renegotiate the agreement 
the company intends to amend its existing credit facility to provide for a revolving line of credit that will mature in  and to refinance amounts outstanding under the current line of credit into a term loan with quarterly repayments through as of december   we were in compliance with our covenants under the credit facility 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million as of december   compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the receipt of the million upfront sublicense fee received in total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion of our facilities in bothell  washington and in budapest  hungary 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of property and equipment and million for net purchases of investment securities 
during  we generated million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million provided by proceeds from the sale of common stock  stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings offset  in part  by million for payments of long term debt 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions  as evidenced by our acquisitions in of amri uk and amri burlington 
both acquisitions were funded from existing cash and cash equivalents 
we expect that additional future capital expansion and acquisition activities  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods
