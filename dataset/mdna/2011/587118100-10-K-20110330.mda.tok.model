off balance sheet arrangements other than the noncancelable operating leases  other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 

table of contents inflation the company believes the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model 
however  because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
our critical accounting policies  which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management  are discussed below 
revenue recognition clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise  net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns  and excludes sales taxes 
revenues from tuxedo rental  alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services 
we present all non income government assessed taxes sales  use and value added taxes collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis excluded from net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
the government assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on the average cost method 
our inventory cost also includes estimated buying and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  buying and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of buying and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we changed the method of determining cost under the lower of cost or market inventory valuation method used for our k g brand representing approximately of our inventory from the retail inventory method to the average cost method 
we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle retrospectively as of february  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as of february  was an increase in inventory of million  a decrease in deferred tax assets of million and a net increase in retained earnings of million 
the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income  as well as consolidated net earnings  for all comparable periods presented by insignificant amounts 
the change in accounting principle did not have any impact on our previously reported net cash flows  sales or comparable store sales 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives  are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  the company s future operating plans and projected cash flows 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to 
table of contents the assets  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets does not exceed the carrying value of the assets  full or partial impairment may exist 
if the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using an income approach  which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  costs and useful lives of assets 
significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset 
changes to our key assumptions related to future performance  market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation 
for example  unanticipated adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related mainly to store assets for two k g stores still in operation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores and k g stores 
during fiscal  we recognized pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores  four k g stores and three men s wearhouse stores 
the pretax asset impairment charges for the k g stores of million in  million in and million in are the result primarily of sales declines that started in and continued through fiscal caused mainly by the downturn experienced by the us economy 
the pretax asset impairment charges related to the store assets for the men s wearhouse and tux stores were million in fiscal and million in fiscal most of our stand alone tuxedo rental stores were acquired in april or opened subsequently and operated as mw tux from the fourth quarter of fiscal until the first quarter of fiscal when they were renamed men s wearhouse and tux 
these rental stores offer a full selection of tuxedo rental product as well as an expanded selection of retail merchandise  including dress and casual apparel targeted towards a younger customer  which was introduced during the first quarter of fiscal it was anticipated that expanding the retail merchandise at the rental stores and renaming them to men s wearhouse and tux would diminish or possibly reverse a consumer driven shifting of rental revenues that was occurring from the rental stores to our men s wearhouse stores located in close proximity one mile or less 
although the expanded merchandise offering contributed to a significant increase in retail clothing sales by the rental stores in fiscal and  the shifting of tuxedo rental revenues from the rental stores to nearby men s wearhouse stores continued to occur 
in total  tuxedo rental revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in and million in fiscal  however  million and million of store assets in fiscal and  respectively  for the stand alone men s wearhouse and tux stores were impaired due mainly to the shifting of rental revenues 
in fiscal  we also recognized pretax asset impairment charges of million for three men s wearhouse stores  two which are still in operation 
changes to our key assumptions related to future performance  market conditions and other economic factors could result in future impairment charges for stores or other long lived assets where the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values 
trademarks  tradenames  customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of to years using the straight line method and are periodically evaluated for impairment as discussed in the impairment of long lived assets section above 
identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life  including goodwill  are not amortized but are evaluated annually as of our fiscal year end for impairment 
a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 
such events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 
goodwill represents the excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations 
goodwill totaled million at january   of which million related to our acquisition of dimensions on august  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of our impairment evaluation  the reporting units are our operating brands identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands 
the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed in 
table of contents two steps 
the first step is intended to determine if potential impairment exists and is performed by comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired  and we must complete the second step of the testing to determine the amount of any impairment 
the second step requires an allocation of the reporting unit s first step estimated fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts allocated to the individual assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
in our step one process  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combined income and market comparable approach 
our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 
the market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit 
we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process 
the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions 
critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenue  gross margin and expense 
the cash flows are based on the company s most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our impairment evaluation are reasonable  however  variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants 
given current economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our reporting units ranged from to for the analysis 
selection of comparable companies within the industry 
for purposes of the market comparable approach  valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the reporting units being analyzed and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the reporting unit 
while the market price multiple is not an assumption  a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation 
the determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment 
earnings multiples of to were used for the analysis for our operating brands including men s wearhouse  k g  moores and mw cleaners 
as discussed above  the fair values of reporting units in were determined using a combined income and market comparable approach 
we believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing 
however  we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so 
the fair value derived from the weighting of these two methods provided appropriate valuations that  in aggregate  reasonably reconciled to our market capitalization  taking into account observable control premiums 
therefore  we used the valuations in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the reporting units 
actual values may differ significantly from these judgments  particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units 
sustained declines in the company s market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment 
such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would  in turn  negatively impact the company s results of operations  however  any such goodwill impairments would be non cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our current debt covenants 
no goodwill impairment was identified in fiscal  or 
table of contents tuxedo rental product the cost of our tuxedo rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented  which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product 
lost  damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales 
tuxedo rental product is amortized to expense generally over a two to three year period 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience and information obtained from tuxedo rental industry sources  as to the number of times each unit can be rented 
if the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates  it could materially affect the amount of tuxedo rental product amortization included in cost of sales 
self insurance we self insure significant portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the deferred tax assets are reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since  in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions 
we have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals  as warranted  due to changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our uncertain tax positions  in any given period  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for that period 
operating leases our operating leases primarily relate to stores and generally contain rent escalation clauses  rent holidays  contingent rent provisions and occasionally leasehold incentives 
we recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which is generally five to ten years based on the initial lease term plus first renewal option periods that are reasonably assured 
rent expense for stores is included in cost of sales as a part of occupancy cost and other rent is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lease terms commence when we take possession with the right to control use of the leased premises and  for stores  is generally days prior to the date rent payments begin 
rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense 
deferred rent that results from recognition of rent on a straight line basis is included in other liabilities 
landlord incentives received for reimbursement of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
contingent rentals are generally based on percentages of sales and are recognized as store rent expense as they accrue 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that expands the required disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance provides for new disclosures requiring the company to a disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and b present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the company to i determine each class of assets and liabilities based on the nature and risks of the investments rather than by major security type and ii for each class of assets and liabilities  disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both level and level fair value measurements 
we adopted this guidance effective january   except for the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the first phase of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not expect the adoption of the second phase of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb updated the disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this update specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this amendment also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures related to business combinations to include a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to clarify when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
this update modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  requiring the entity to assess whether it is more likely than not that the reporting units goodwill is impaired in order to determine if the entity should perform step of the goodwill impairment test for those reporting unit s 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rates  us dollar pounds sterling gbp exchange rates and us dollar canadian dollar cad exchange rates as a result of our direct sourcing programs and our operations in foreign countries 
our acquired uk based operations in particular are subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar gbp exchange rates as dimensions and alexandra sell their products and conduct their business primarily in gbp but purchase most of their merchandise in transactions paid in us dollars 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial information and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for our direct sourcing programs that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company has not elected to apply hedge accounting to these transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
at january   we had six contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase euros for an aggregate notional amount of us million maturing at various dates through october  contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase us dollars for an aggregate notional amount of cad million maturing at various dates through may and contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase us dollars for an aggregate notional amount of gbp million maturing at various dates through september for the fiscal year ended january   we recognized a pre tax gain of million in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings for our derivative financial instruments not designated as cash flow hedges 
we held no outstanding contracts at january  a hypothetical increase in applicable january  forward rates could decrease the fair value of the derivative financial instruments by million  whereas a hypothetical decrease in applicable january  forward rates could increase the fair value of the derivative contracts by million 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
dimensions and alexandra  our uk based acquisitions  sell their products and conduct their business primarily in gbp but purchase most of their merchandise in transactions paid in us dollars 
the exchange rate between the gbp and us dollar has fluctuated over the last ten years 
a decline in the value of the gbp as compared to the us dollar will adversely impact our uk operating results as the cost of merchandise purchases will increase and the revenues and earnings of our uk operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our uk net assets in us dollars may decline 
dimensions and alexandra utilize foreign currency hedging contracts as discussed above to limit exposure to changes in us dollar gbp exchange rates 
moores conducts its business in cad 
the exchange rate between cad and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the cad against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
moores utilizes foreign currency hedging contracts as discussed above to limit exposure to changes in us dollar cad exchange rates 
interest rate risk we are also exposed to risk under our credit agreement 
interest rates under our credit agreement vary with the i adjusted libo rate  ii adjusted euribo rate  iii cdo rate  iv canadian prime rate or v an alternate base rate equal to the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libo rate for a one month period plus 
advances under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum using the applicable indices plus a varying interest rate margin up to 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
we also have exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates as those rates relate to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
as of january   we have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet 
future investment income earned on our cash equivalents will fluctuate in line with short term interest rates
