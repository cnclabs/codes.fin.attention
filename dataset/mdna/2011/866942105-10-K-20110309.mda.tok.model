critical accounting policies and estimates the company currently only applies judgment and estimates which may have a material effect on the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for impairment of long lived assets  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill  accruals  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
the following explains the basis and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied 
revenue recognition the company reports revenues  net of sales incentives  when title passes and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the effect of material non recurring events related to product liabilities is provided for when they become known 
the company has not experienced any material product liabilities in the past 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
accounts receivable the company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis  primarily through distributors with which the company maintains long term relationships 
as a result  bad debt experience has not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears 
there can be no assurance that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties and default on payment 
see consolidated balance sheets for allowance amounts 
inventory the company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not discontinue products 
on an ongoing basis  component parts found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost

the company accrues for health care benefit costs under a self funded plan 
the company purchases re insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed thousand on an individual basis and approximately million on an aggregate basis 
stock based compensation all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense in earnings over the requisite service period 
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are reported as a financing cash inflow 
income taxes the company s income tax policy provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable 
these differences result from items reported differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes  primarily depreciation  accrued expenses and reserves
