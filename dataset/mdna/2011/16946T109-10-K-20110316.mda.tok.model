for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition 
chinacast s principal sources of revenues are from provision of satellite bandwidth and network access services in distance learning and to a lesser extent  the provision of english training services sales of satellite communication related equipment and accessories 
chinacast recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  product is shipped and title has passed  the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  chinacast assesses whether the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
chinacast assesses whether the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  including  but not limited to  the payment terms associated with the transaction 
chinacast assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
the revenues from provision of distance learning services via satellite bandwidth and network is recognized as the services are provided 
subscription fee received from the multimedia educational content broadcasting service is recognized as revenue over the subscription period during which the services are delivered 
revenues from bachelor degree and diploma program offerings  representing tuition fees and accommodation and catering service income  are recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
the colleges academic year is generally from september to august of the following year 
all the admitted students need to register in september at the beginning of a semester 
there are mainly two ways the tuitions are collected 
a student either a pays the tuition fee in cash at the beginning of each academic year when registering in september  or b registers in september but uses student loans to pay the tuition fee later 
the tuition fee would be collected once the student loan is processed by the bank 
revenue recognition is the same in both cases 
tuition received from degree and diploma programs is recognized proportionately over the relevant period attended by the students of the applicable program 
the portion of tuition payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue and is reflected as a current liability as such amounts represent revenue that the company expects to earn within one year 
tuition refunds are provided to students if they decided to withdraw from school for the remaining service period  up to of the tuition fee received 
tuition refunds have not been significant since the cancellation rate has been low 
revenues from satellite communication related equipment and accessories are recognized once the equipment and accessories are delivered and accepted by the customers 
useful lives and impairment of property and equipment  and acquired intangible assets 
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
in particular  customer relationship ftbc acquired is amortized using the accelerated amortization method up to months based on the estimated progression of the students through the respective courses  giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated 
customer relationship ljc acquired is amortized using the accelerated amortization method up to months based on the estimated progression of the students through the respective courses  giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated 
affiliation agreement acquired is amortized on a straight line basis up to months 
customer relationship hiubc acquired is amortized using the accelerated amortization method over months based on the estimated progression of the students through the respective courses  giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated 
affiliation agreement acquired is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
prepaid lease payments for land use rights 
all land in the prc is owned by the prc government 
the government in the prc  according to the relevant prc law  may grant the right to use the land for a specified period of time 
payments for acquiring land use rights represent prepayments of rentals over the periods the rights are granted and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and any recognized impairment loss 
amortization is provided over the term of the land use right agreement on a straight line basis 
prepaid lease payments which are to be amortized in the next twelve months or less are classified as current assets 
impairment of non current advances 
the non current advances by the company to ccl were for money spent on asset and expenses to build up the satellite business of ccl over the years 
on december   cctsh  cclx and ccl entered into a service agreement the service agreement under which ccl will assist cclx to renew the inter provincial value added telecommunication service license the vsat license for the next ten years 
the vsat license is critical to the company e learning and training services 
without the license  the company is not allowed to conduct its business through satellite in china 
prior to december   the license was renewed each year with the assistance from ccl 
in consideration of ccl service in assisting the company to obtain the renewal of the license  the company shall pay an annual service fees to ccl in the amount of rmb million during the service term of the service agreement and rmb million remaining balance of the noncurrent advances  after deducting the purchase price of nci in cclx  will be used as a prepayment for this service 
however  given that the annual renewal of vsat license needs to be approved by a government agency and the result is not under the control of neither ccl nor cclx  the company believes that the fair value of the vsat license renewal service to be provided by ccl cannot be reasonably estimated 
in addition  cclx undertakes to ccl in the service agreement that it will not take back nor to recover any amount of the prepayment even though it subsequently does not require the service of ccl during the entire service term 
as a result  the company decided to write off the rmb million for the prepayment for vsat license renewal service 
the impairment loss of rmb million is included in the operating income 
share based compensation 
the company accounts for employee stock options under authoritative pronouncement issued by the fasb regarding share based payment from the inception of the company stock compensation plans 
compensation cost related to employee share options or similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period  with a corresponding addition to paid in capital 
purchase price allocation in business combination 
for business acquisition recorded using the purchase method of accounting  acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair market value at the date of acquisition 
the company performs purchase price allocation based on such fair values 
the valuation analyses utilize and consider generally accepted valuation methodologies such as income  market and cost approach 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
impairment of cost method investments 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of the cost method investments for continued appropriateness 
when there is an impairment indicator 
this review is based upon the company s projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while the company believes that the estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuations 
income taxes 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its substantial deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized and assesses the need for valuation allowance 
effective on january   the company adopted the authoritative pronouncement regarding uncertainty in income taxes 
under the guidance  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely that not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority based solely on technical merits of the associated tax position 
if the company ultimately determines that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the company will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during that period 
conversely  the company records additional tax charges in a period in which it determines that a recorded tax liability is less than the expected ultimate assessment 
the company also elected the accounting policy that the interest and penalties recognized are classified as part of its income taxes 
the unrecognized tax benefits  tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties represent management s estimates under the provisions of the guidance 
the three acquired universities have not paid any income tax so far 
the company provided provision of unrecognized tax benefits for the three acquired universities since significant judgments are required in determining whether such universities are qualified for the income tax exemption 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result 
as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefits was approximately rmb million 
impairment of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  by operating segments was as follows rmb rmb e learning and training serve group elg traditional university group tug 
authoritative pronouncement issued by fasb regarding goodwill and others intangible assets  requires that the goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level 
the guidance requires a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test at december  our reporting units are consistent with our two operating segments 
the goodwill allocated to our elg segment arose in when we further purchased a portion of non controlling interests of one subsidiary  cct bvi  from three non controlling shareholders 
we note that prior to this was the only reporting unit and segment of the company  and the market capitalization of the company as of december  rmb  million greatly exceeded the carrying amount of the elg reporting unit  rmb million 
accordingly  we determined that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was passed  and that the goodwill of the elg reporting unit was not impaired as of december  the assets and liabilities that make up the elg reporting unit did not change significantly from to the elg reporting unit is a relatively well established business 
revenue of this reporting unit has been growing steadily since revenue grew from to  and we expect that the revenue of this reporting unit will continue to grow in the future 
no significant negative events occurred and the likelihood that the fair value would be less than the carrying amount of the elg reporting unit as of december  was remote 
therefore we determined that the fair value of the elg reporting unit would be no less than the carrying amount of this reporting unit 
the company had one acquisition in which resulted in the addition of the tug segment 
the company had another acquisition in and  repectively  to further expand the tug segment 
for our tug segment  we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach 
the income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates to estimated cash flows that are based on earnings of forecasts developed by us 
the assumptions used in deriving the fair valuations are consistent with our business plan at the time of each valuation 
these assumptions include no material changes in the existing political  legal and economic conditions in china  no major changes in applicable tax rates and no material deviation in market conditions from our forecasts 
the risks associated with achieving our forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated cash flows 
in particular  the discounted cash flows for the tug reporting unit were based on discrete five year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the five year discrete forecast were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for the reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the tug reporting unit are key assumptions description revenue growth rate the forecasted average annual growth rate of revenue is from to this reflects the following assumptions student capacity of the campus is expected to grow upon completion of the planned construction projects  demand for accredited degree program is expected to grow significantly in the prc  and a long term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined to be with reference to the birth rate  market penetration and other related factors 
cogs growth rate cost of goods sold cogs are forecasted to grow by to from to discount rate the discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc of the company 
wacc is the weighted average of the estimated rate of return required by equity and debt holders for an investment of this type 
we used to 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
during the years ended december   and  we determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill

the amendments effectively replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance 
the new guidance also requires additional disclosures about a reporting entity involvement with variable interest entities and about any significant changes in risk exposure as a result of that involvement 
the new guidance is effective at the start of a reporting entity first fiscal year beginning after november   and all interim and annual periods thereafter 
the company has had one consolidated variable interest entity under the authoritative literature prior to the amendment discussed above because it was the primary beneficiary of the entity 
because the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity 
this new guidance has been adopted by the company on january  the company continues to consolidate the variable interest entity upon the adoption of the new guidance which therefore has no impact on the company financial condition or results of operations  except for the additional disclosures on the face of and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the guidance clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition  and therefore should be considered an equity award assuming all other criteria for equity classification are met

affected entities will be required to record a cumulative catch up adjustment for all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the annual period in which the guidance is adopted 
in december  the fasb issued an authoritative pronouncement on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this update modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early adoption will not be permitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk our reporting currency is the renminbi 
transactions in other currencies are recorded in renminbi at the rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are remeasured into renminbi at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates 
exchange gains and losses are recorded in our statements of operations as a component of current period earnings 
the prc state administration for foreign exchange  under the authority of the people s bank of china  controls the conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies 
the principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in china is the foreign currency administration rules  as amended  or the rules 
under the rules  once various procedural requirements are met  renminbi is convertible for current account transactions  including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments  but not for capital account transactions  including direct investment  loans or investments in securities outside china  without prior approval of the state administration of foreign exchange of the people s republic of china  or its local counterparts 
since july  the renminbi is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
although currently the renminbi exchange rate versus the us dollar is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than per day and the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  the prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
as of december   the exchange rate of rmb to us was rmb we conduct substantially all of our operations through our prc operating companies  and their financial performance and position are measured in terms of renminbi 
our solutions are primarily procured  sold and delivered in the prc for renminbi 
the majority of our net revenue are denominated in renminbi 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
on the other hand  the appreciation of the renminbi could make our customers products more expensive to purchase because many of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as of december  and  we have cash denominated in us dollars amounting to rmb million us million and rmb million  respectively 
also  from time to time we may have us dollar denominated borrowings 
accordingly  a decoupling of the renminbi many affect our financial performance in the future 
we recognized a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately rmb million us million for the year ended december  we do not currently engage in hedging activities  as such  we may in the future experience economic loss as a result of any foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk we have a long history of investing excess cash under a conservative corporate policy that only allows investments in bank fixed deposits  with preservation of capital and liquidity as the primary objectives 
for the year ended december   we recorded an interest income of rmb million us million 
any significant changes in interest rate might have an adverse effect on this interest income 
we have short term and long term bank loans amounting to rmb million us million at december  interest expense in the twelve months ended december  was rmb million us million 
any significant changes in interest rate might have an adverse effect on interest expense 
inflation in recent years  china has not experienced significant inflation  and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in  and  respectively
