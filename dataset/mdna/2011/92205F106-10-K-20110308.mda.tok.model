item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  forecasts  guidance  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas  production volumes  estimates of proved reserves  capital expenditures  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a risk factors and forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature  long lived oil and natural gas properties in the united states 
our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and over time to increase our quarterly cash distributions through the acquisition of new oil and natural gas properties 
we own a controlling interest  through certain of our subsidiaries  in properties and oil and natural gas reserves located in four operating areas the permian basin in west texas and new mexico  south texas  the southern portion of the appalachian basin  primarily in southeast kentucky and northeast tennessee  and mississippi 
in addition  we own an approximate aggregate controlling interest through our subsidiary  enp  in properties and oil and natural gas reserves located in four operating areas the permian basin in west texas and new mexico  the big horn basin in wyoming and montana  the williston basin in north dakota and montana  and the arkoma basin in arkansas and oklahoma 
at december   we owned working interests in  gross  net productive wells  including those wells acquired in the encore acquisition  which are subject to a non controlling interest 
in addition to these productive wells  we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells 
as of december   we had a working interest in approximately  gross undeveloped acres surrounding or adjacent to our existing wells located in the appalachian basin 
in south texas and the permian basin  vnr owns working interests ranging from in approximately  undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells 
additionally  enp owns working interests ranging from in approximately  undeveloped acres surrounding their existing wells in the permian basin  big horn basin  williston basin and arkoma basin 
approximately or mmboe of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to our working interests in undeveloped acreage 
the proved undeveloped reserves that we acquired in connection with the encore acquisition are subject to a non controlling interest in enp 
initial public offering in october  we completed our ipo of million units representing limited liability interests in vnr at per unit for net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and fees of million 
in addition  we incurred offering costs of million in connection with the ipo 
the proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness under our reserve based credit facility by million and the balance was used for the payment of accrued distributions to pre ipo unitholders and the payment of a deferred swap obligation 
recent developments encore acquisition on december   we completed an acquisition pursuant to a purchase agreement with denbury resources inc denbury  encore partners gp holdings llc  encore partners lp holdings llc and encore operating  lp collectively  the encore selling parties and  together with denbury  the selling parties to acquire the encore acquisition or encore all of the member interest in enp gp  the general partner of enp and  common units representing limited partnership interests in enp the enp units  representing a aggregate equity interest in enp 
as consideration for the purchase  we paid million in cash and paid million in stock by issuing  vnr common units  at an agreed upon price of per unit  valued at the closing price of at december  in connection with closing of the encore acquisition  vng entered into a second amended and restated administrative services agreement  dated december   with enp  enp gp  encore operating  lp encore operating  ollc and denbury the services agreement 
the services agreement was amended solely to add vng as a party and provide for vng to assume the rights and obligations of encore operating and denbury under the previous administrative services agreement going forward 
pursuant to the services agreement  vng will provide certain general and administrative services to enp  enp gp and the ollc collectively  the enp group in exchange for a quarterly fee of per barrel of oil equivalent of the enp group s total net oil and gas production for the most recently completed quarter  which fee is paid by enp the administrative fee 
the administrative fee is subject to certain index related adjustments on an annual basis

shelf registration statements in november  enp s shelf registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec 
under the shelf registration statement  enp may offer common units  senior debt  or subordinated debt in one or more offerings with a total initial offering price of up to billion 
in may  enp issued  common units under its shelf registration statement at a price to the public of per common unit 
in july  enp issued  common units under its shelf registration statement at a price to the public of per common unit 
as a result of these offerings  as of december   enp has approximately million remaining available under its shelf registration statement

net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offering of securities issued under the shelf registration statement is determined at the time of the offerings 
the shelf registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
our ability to utilize the shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities or common units will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us

our ability to utilize the shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities or common units will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us 
in august  we entered into an equity distribution agreement relating to our common units representing limited liability company interests having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
in accordance with the terms of the equity distribution agreement we may offer and sell up to the maximum dollar amount of our units from time to time through our sales agent 
sales of the units  if any  may be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions through the facilities of the new york stock exchange  or nyse  at market prices 
our sales agent will receive from us a commission of based on the gross sales price per unit for any units sold through it as agent under the equity distribution agreement 
during september through december  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sales of  common units  after commissions 
in october  we completed an offering of million of our common units

we paid million of the proceeds of this offering to redeem  common units from our founding unitholder 
the remaining net proceeds of million were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under our reserve based credit facility 
as a result of these offerings  as of december   we have approximately million and million remaining available under our and shelf registration statements  respectively 
outlook our revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as access to capital  economic  political and regulatory developments  and competition from other sources of energy 
multiple events during and involving numerous financial institutions effectively restricted liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
while capital markets remain volatile  efforts by treasury and banking regulators in the united states  europe and other nations around the world to provide liquidity to the financial sector appears to have improved the situation 
as evidenced by our recent successful equity offerings  successful amendment of our reserve based credit facility and recent successful equity and debt offerings by our peers  we believe that our access to capital has improved and we have been successful in improving our financial position to date 
we intend to move forward with our development drilling program when market conditions allow for an adequate return on the drilling investment and only when we have sufficient liquidity to do so 
maintaining adequate liquidity may involve the issuance of debt and equity at less attractive terms  could involve the sale of non core assets and could require reductions in our capital spending 
in the near term we will focus on maximizing returns on existing assets by managing our costs  selectively deploying capital to improve existing production and drilling a limited number of wells which we believe will provide an adequate return on the investment 
oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves that we can economically produce  our access to capital and our ability to pay distributions 
we have mitigated the volatility on our cash flows with natural gas price derivative contracts through and oil price derivative contracts through these hedges are placed on a portion of our proved producing and a portion of our total anticipated production during this time frame 
as oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fluctuate  we will recognize non cash  unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations related to the change in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
we face the challenge of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production declines 
as a given well s initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production decreases  thus reducing our total reserves 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline both by drilling on our properties and acquiring additional reserves 
we will maintain our focus on controlling costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  as well as controlling the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves 
during the year ended december   we drilled and completed two gross two net wells on operated properties and drilled and completed six gross net non operated wells 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals and voluntary reductions in capital spending in a low commodity price environment 
any delays in drilling  completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact the rate of our production  which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result  cash available for distribution 
in accordance with our business plan  we intend to invest the capital necessary to maintain our production at existing levels over the long term provided that it is economical to do so based on the commodity price environment 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to issue equity or debt securities on favorable terms  or at all  and we may be unable to refinance our reserve based credit facility when it expires 
additionally  in the event of significant declines in commodity prices  our borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility may be re determined such that it will not provide for the working capital necessary to fund our capital spending program and could affect our ability to make distributions 
the next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is april results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated 
this table does not include the operating results of the subsidiaries we acquired in the encore acquisition at december  year ended december  in thousands revenues oil sales gas sales natural gas liquids sales oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales gain loss on commodity cash flow hedges realized gain loss on other commodity derivative contracts unrealized gain loss on other commodity derivative contracts total revenues costs and expenses lease operating expenses depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion impairment of oil and natural gas properties selling  general and administrative expenses production and other taxes total costs and expenses other income and expenses interest expense  net realized loss on interest rate derivative contracts gain loss on acquisition of oil and natural gas properties unrealized gain loss on interest rate derivative contracts in  and  we acquired certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets in the permian basin  south texas and mississippi

the ward county acquisition closed on december  and  as such  only approximately one month of operations is included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the permian area  calculated using the actual number of days for the ward county acquisition from the closing date to the end of the reported period  was mcf day of natural gas   bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during south texas area includes production from the dos hermanos  sun tsh and a portion of the parker creek acquisitions 
the parker creek acquisition closed on may  and  as such  only seven months and eleven days of operations are included in the year ended december   and no operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the south texas area  calculated using the actual number of days for the parker creek acquisition from the closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during the average daily production for the mississippi area  calculated using the actual number of days for the parker creek acquisition from the closing date to the end of the reported period  was mcf day of natural gas and bbls day of oil during includes production from dos hermanos and sun tsh acquisitions 
the sun tsh acquisition closed on august  and  as such  only approximately four and one half months of operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the south texas area  calculated using the actual number of days for the sun tsh acquisition from the closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the increase in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increases in commodity prices and an increase in production 
we experienced a increase in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a increase in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
additionally  our total production increased by on a boe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in was primarily attributable to the impact from the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions completed in august  december and may  respectively 
in appalachia  we experienced a decrease in natural gas production which was partially offset by a increase in oil production during year ended december  compared to the same period in for a net production decline of on a boe basis 
while our natural gas wells had lower production during  we experienced a increase in appalachian oil production primarily due to our focus on completing seven vertical oil wells in hedging and price risk management activities during the years ended december  and  the company recognized million and million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges  respectively 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
the losses on commodity cash flow hedges for the years ended december  and relate to the amounts that settled in those years and have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized a million and million realized gain on other commodity derivative contracts  respectively  related to the settlements recognized during those periods and a million and million loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting in those periods  respectively 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because the majority of our hedges are not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses in appalachia also historically included a per well per month administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland 
this fee was temporarily increased to per well per month beginning march  through december  pursuant to an agreement whereunder vinland provided well tending services on vanguard owned wells under a turnkey pricing contract 
in addition  we historically have paid a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
this gathering and compression agreement was amended for the period beginning march  through december  to provide for a temporary fee based upon the actual costs incurred by vinland to provide gathering and transportation services plus a per mcf margin 
both temporary amendments expired on december  and all the terms of the agreements reverted back to the original agreements 
in june  we began discussions with vinland regarding an amendment to the gathering and compression agreement to go into effect beginning on july  the amended agreement would provide gathering and compression services based upon actual costs plus a margin of 
per mcf 
we and vinland agreed in principle to this change effective july  and we have jointly operated on this basis although the formal agreements have yet to be signed 
we are currently negotiating other agreements with vinland concerning our joint operations and our intent is to have all our operations governed under a single set of agreements  including this amendment to the gathering and compression agreement 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of which million related to the sun tsh and ward county and parker creek acquisitions and million related to increase lease operating expenses for wells in appalachia 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to the additional depletion recorded on the oil and natural gas properties acquired in the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions 
an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using the month average price of oil and natural gas  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an additional impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the majority of the fourth quarter impairment was incurred on properties that we acquired in the last six months of when oil and natural gas prices were higher than the month average price 
we were able to lock in the higher prices at the time of the acquisitions for a substantial portion of the expected production through for natural gas and for crude oil by using commodity derivative contracts 
however  the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
no impairment of oil and natural gas properties was necessary during the year ended december  in addition  our analysis of goodwill concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  principally due to a decrease in non cash compensation charges related to the grant of restricted class b units to officers and an employee  the grant of phantom units to officers and the grant of common units to board members and employees 
non cash compensation charges declined million to million for the year ended december  offsetting this decline was a million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily related to transaction costs incurred in connection with the encore acquisition and a million increase in bonuses awarded to employees 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem  and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in severance taxes increased million as a result of increased oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales 
texas margin and other corporate taxes increased by million and ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to an increase of million in the taxes on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions  offset by a million decrease in the taxes on appalachia properties 
other income and expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt for the year ended december  in accordance with the guidance contained within asc topic  the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the parker creek acquisition as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss for the year ended december  the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the sun tsh and ward county acquisitions as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in a gain of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  this gain and loss resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves

the average daily production for the south texas area  calculated using the actual number of days for the sun tsh acquisition from the closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during the dos hermanos acquisition closed on july  and  as such  only five months of operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the dos hermanos acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas and  gal day of natural gas liquids during excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the decrease in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the decreases in commodity prices 
we experienced a decrease in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a decrease in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
the decrease in commodity prices was partially offset by a increase in our total production on a boe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in  despite not drilling any new wells in  was primarily attributable to the impact from the dos hermanos  sun tsh and ward county acquisitions completed in july  august and december  respectively 
in appalachia  we experienced a decrease in natural gas production which was partially offset by a increase in oil production during year ended december  compared to the same period in for a net production decline of on a boe basis 
the decrease in natural gas production is largely attributable to our decision to not drill wells in due to low natural gas prices 
the increase in appalachian oil production was primarily due to our focus on completing to oil zones as oil prices increased during and recompleting to oil zones on existing natural gas wells in  which also adversely affected the amount of natural gas produced in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   the company recognized million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  these amounts relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
the loss and gain on commodity cash flow hedges for the years ended december  and relate to the amounts that settled in those periods and have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a million realized gain on other commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
comparatively  during the year ended december   the company recognized a million realized loss on other commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million gain related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because the majority of our hedges are not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses in appalachia also included a per month per well administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland 
this fee was increased to per well per month beginning march  through december  pursuant to an agreement whereunder vinland has agreed to provide well tending services on vanguard owned wells under a turnkey pricing contract 
in addition  we historically have paid a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
this gathering and compression agreement was amended for the period beginning march  through december  to provide for a fee based upon the actual costs incurred by vinland to provide gathering and transportation services plus a per mcf margin 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year months ended december  of which million related to the dos hermanos  sun tsh and ward county acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to a lower unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties as a result of the impairments of these properties recorded during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  offset by additional depletion recorded on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the sun tsh and ward county acquisitions 
an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using the month average price of oil and natural gas  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an additional impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the majority of the fourth quarter impairment was incurred on properties that we acquired in the last six months of when oil and natural gas prices were higher than the month average price 
we were able to lock in the higher prices at the time of the acquisitions for a substantial portion of the expected production through for natural gas and for crude oil by using commodity derivative contracts 
however  the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december  these expenses included a charge for the fair value of phantom units granted to officers of million 
these phantom units were granted to two officers in amounts equal to of our units outstanding at january  and the amount paid in either cash or units was equal to the appreciation in value of the units  if any  from the date of the grant until the determination date december   plus cash distributions paid on the units  less an hurdle rate 
there was no appreciation in the fair value of phantom units granted to officers during the year ended december  the remaining increase of million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is principally due to incremental costs associated with the company s growth and acquisitions 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem  and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in severance taxes decreased million resulting from decreased oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales 
texas margin tax decreased by million and ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to the taxes in appalachia being based on revenues 
other income and expense interest expense declined to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average outstanding debt for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
please read note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to the full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of proved gas and oil properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in asc topic  property  plant and equipment  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at using commodity prices based upon the month average price ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged as an expense 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly related to these finding activities 
for the years ended december  and  there were no internal costs capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
our results of operations would have been different had we used the successful efforts method for our oil and natural gas investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts method of accounting 
full cost ceiling test at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using oil and natural gas price based upon the month average price  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  for which hedge accounting is applied  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties ceiling test 
in and  most of our hedges were not considered cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and thus a significant portion of the value of our hedges were not considered in our ceiling test calculations 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  requires that the present value of future net revenue from proved properties be calculated based upon the month average price 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development as more fully discussed in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve quantities below 
due to the imprecision in estimating oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as well as the potential volatility in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves  there can be no assurance that additional ceiling test write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas properties 
these factors include declining oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
while no ceiling test impairment was required during  we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended december  of million 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an additional impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended december  of million as a result of a decline in oil and natural gas prices at the measurement date 
this impairment was calculated based on year end prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
business combinations we account for business combinations under asc topic  business combinations 
we recognize and measure in our financial statements the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interests in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in all transactions in which control of one or more businesses is obtained 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the provisions of the goodwill and other intangible assets topic of the asc 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is assessed for impairment annually on october or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill test is performed at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  which are vanguard s historical oil and natural gas operations in the united states and enp s oil and natural gas operations in the united states 
at december   all goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit comprised of enp s oil and natural gas operations in the united states 
if indicators of impairment are determined to exist  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we utilize both a market capitalization and an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the primary component of the income approach is the estimated discounted future net cash flows expected to be recovered from the reporting unit s oil and natural gas properties 
our analysis concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  any sharp decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas or any significant negative reserve adjustments from the december  assessment could change our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with definite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
we allocate the purchase price paid for the acquisition of a business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values of those assets and liabilities 
estimates of fair value are based upon  among other things  reserve estimates  anticipated future prices and costs  and expected net cash flows to be generated 
these estimates are often highly subjective and may have a material impact on the amounts recorded for acquired assets and liabilities 
asset retirement obligation we have obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of an oil or natural gas well s life 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and the decommissioning of enp s elk basin gas plant 
estimating the future plugging and abandonment costs requires management to make estimates and judgments inherent in the present value calculation of the future obligation 
these include ultimate plugging and abandonment costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and timing of the obligation 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance 
oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve quantities proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
in addition  the sec has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
revenue recognition sales of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are recognized when oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids have been delivered to a custody transfer point  persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery  collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we sell oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids on a monthly basis 
virtually all of our contracts pricing provisions are tied to a market index  with certain adjustments based on  among other factors  whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line  quality of the natural gas or oil  and prevailing supply and demand conditions  so that the price of the natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies 
as a result  our revenues from the sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids will suffer if market prices decline and benefit if they increase without consideration of hedging 
we believe that the pricing provisions of our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids contracts are customary in the industry 
to the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties  the expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded 
the company has elected the entitlements method to account for gas production imbalances 
gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess of our share is treated as a liability 
if we receive less than our entitled share the underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
we did not have any significant gas imbalance positions at december  or price risk management activities we periodically use derivative financial instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from our oil and natural gas production by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
currently  these derivative financial instruments include fixed price swaps  swaptions  put options and collars 
the derivative instruments we established in were designated as hedges under asc topic in connection with preparing its quarterly report for third quarter and discussion with bdo usa  llp  the company s then new independent registered public accounting firm  management of the company and the audit committee of its board of directors concluded that the contemporaneous formal documentation it had prepared to support its initial hedge designations and subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness in connection with the company s oil and natural gas hedging program in did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with asc topic the primary reasons for this determination were that the formal hedge documentation lacked specificity of the hedged cash flow and the quantitative subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness were insufficient 
therefore  the cash flow designations failed to meet hedge documentation requirements for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
in addition  the natural gas derivative swap contracts entered into in were de designated as cash flow hedges in the first quarter of due to an overhedged position in natural gas which made them ineffective 
under asc topic  the fair value of hedge contracts is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability  and the change in fair value of the hedge contracts are reflected in earnings 
if the hedge contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the fair value of the hedge contract is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and changes in the fair value do not affect net income until the contract is settled 
if the hedge contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the change in the fair value of the hedge contract is reflected in earnings during the period as gain or loss on other commodity derivatives 
under the cash flow hedge accounting treatment used by the company in  the fair values of the hedge contracts were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded initially in accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified through earnings when the hedged production affected earnings 
as a result of the determination that the documentation failed to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the unrealized gain or loss on other commodity derivatives was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of revenues in in addition  the net derivative loss at december  related to the de designated natural gas derivative contracts entered into in is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month in which the transactions settle 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation pursuant to asc topic compensation stock compensation asc topic 
asc topic requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
it establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
on march   the sec staff issued sab no 
 share based payment  to express the views of the staff regarding the interaction between asc topic and certain sec rules and regulations and to provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in april  the sole member at that time reserved  restricted class b units in vnr for issuance to employees 
certain members of management were granted  restricted class b units in vnr in april  which vested two years from the date of grant 
in addition  another  restricted vnr class b units were issued in august to two other employees that were hired in april and may of  which vested after three years 
the remaining  restricted class b units were not granted and are not expected to be granted in the future 
in october and february  four board members were granted  common units each of which vested after one year 
additionally  in october  two officers were granted options to purchase an aggregate of  units under our long term incentive plan with an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price of which vested immediately upon being granted and had a fair value of million on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value for these option awards was calculated in accordance with asc topic  by calculating the black scholes value of each option  using a volatility rate of  an expected dividend yield of and a discount rate of  and multiplying the black scholes value by the number of options awarded 
in determining a volatility rate of  the company  due to a lack of historical data regarding the company s common units  used the historical volatility of the citigroup mlp index over the day period prior to the date of grant 
furthermore  on january  and march   in accordance with their previously negotiated employment agreements  phantom units were granted to two officers in amounts equal to of our units outstanding at january  and the phantom units expired on december  and no liability or expense was recognized as there was no appreciation in the value of the units 
the amount in connection with the phantom units was paid in cash and in units at the election of the officers and was equal to the appreciation in value of the units from the date of the grant january  until the determination date december   plus cash distributions paid on the units  less an hurdle rate 
at december   an accrued liability and unit based compensation expense of million was recognized in selling  general and administrative line item in the consolidated statement of operations  of which million is non cash compensation expense 
on january   four board members were granted  common units each which vested in january and on february   employees were granted a total of  units which vested in february in january and march  four board members were each granted  common units  one officer was granted  common units and one board member was granted  common units each of which will vest after one year 
in february  the company and vnrh entered into second amended and restated executive employment agreements the amended agreements with two executives 
the amended agreements were effective january  and will continue until january   with subsequent one year renewals in the event that neither we  vnrh nor the executives have given notice to the other parties that the agreements should not be extended 
also in june  the company and vnrh entered into a second amended and restated executive employment agreement the amended agreement with one executive 
the amended agreement was effective may  and will continue until may   with subsequent one year renewals in the event that neither we  vnrh nor the executive have given notice to the other parties that the agreements should not be extended 
all three amended agreements provide for an annual base salary and include an annual bonus structure for the executives 
the annual bonus will be calculated based upon two company performance elements  absolute target distribution growth and relative unit performance to peer group  as well as a third discretionary element to be determined by our board of directors for the amended agreements entered into in february and by the chief executive officer for the amended agreement entered into in june each of the three components will be weighted equally in calculating the respective executive officer s annual bonus 
the annual bonus does not require a minimum payout  although the maximum payout may not exceed two times the respective executive s annual base salary 
at december   an accrued liability and compensation expense of million was recognized in the selling  general and administrative expenses line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
the amended agreements entered into in february also provide for each executive to receive  restricted units granted pursuant to the vanguard natural resources  llc long term incentive plan the ltip and the amended agreement entered into in june provides for the executive to receive an annual grant of  restricted units granted pursuant to the ltip 
the restricted units are subject to a vesting period of three years 
one third of the aggregate number of the restricted units will vest on each one year anniversary of the date of grant so long as the executive remains continuously employed with the company 
in the event the executives are terminated without cause  or the executive resigns for good reason each term of which is defined in the executive s respective amended agreement  or the executive is terminated due to his death or disability as such term is defined in the amended agreement  all unvested outstanding restricted units shall receive accelerated vesting 
where the executive is terminated for cause  all restricted units  whether vested or unvested  will be forfeited 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in the ltip  all unvested outstanding restricted units shall vest 
in addition  the amended agreements entered into in february provide for each executive to receive an annual grant of  phantom units granted pursuant to the ltip and the amended agreement entered into in june provides for the executive to receive an annual grant of  phantom units granted pursuant to the ltip 
the phantom units are also subject to a three year vesting period  although the vesting is not pro rata  but a one time event which shall occur on the three year anniversary of the date of grant so long as the executive remains continuously employed with the company during such time 
the phantom units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights  which entitle the executives to receive the value of any distributions made by the company on its units generally with respect to the number of phantom units that the executive received pursuant to this grant 
in the event the executive is terminated for cause as such term is defined in the amended agreement  all phantom units  whether vested or unvested  will be forfeited 
the phantom units  once vested  shall be settled upon the earlier to occur of a the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in the ltip  or b the executive s separation from service 
for each executive under the february amended agreements  the amount to be paid in connection with these phantom units  can be paid in cash or in units at the election of the officers and will be equal to the appreciation in value of the units from the date of the grant until the determination date december  
for the executive under the june amended agreement  the amount to be paid in connection with these phantom units  will be settled through the delivery of a number of units equal to the number of phantom units granted 
as of december   an accrued liability associated with the phantom units of million has been recorded and non cash unit based compensation expense of million has been recognized for year ended december   in the selling  general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
in january and february  vnr employees were granted a total of  units which are subject to a four year vesting period 
additionally  in january  enp issued  restricted enp units under the enp ltip  which are also subject to a four year vesting period  to vanguard field employees performing services on enp s properties 
these common units  class b units  options and phantom units were granted as partial consideration for services to be performed under employment contracts and thus are subject to accounting for these grants under asc topic with respect to the common units granted to directors  officers and employees  we expect to incur million in non cash compensation expense for the year for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million of non cash compensation expense related to these units  respectively 
capital resources and liquidity overview we have utilized private equity  proceeds from bank borrowings  cash flow from operations and more recently the public equity markets for capital resources and liquidity 
to date  the primary use of capital has been for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties  however  we expect to distribute to unitholders a significant portion of our free cash flow 
as we execute our business strategy  we will continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet future financial obligations  planned capital expenditures  acquisition capital and distributions to our unitholders 
our future success in growing reserves  production and cash flow will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us and our success in drilling for and acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our drilling capital expenditures and distributions to unitholders with cash flow from operations  while funding any acquisition capital expenditures that we might incur with borrowings under our financing arrangements and publicly offered equity  depending on market conditions 
as of march   we have million and million available to be borrowed under our reserve based credit facility and under enp s revolving credit facility  respectively 
the borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility is subject to adjustment from time to time but not less than on a semi annual basis based on the projected discounted present value of estimated future net cash flows as determined by the bank s petroleum engineers utilizing the bank s internal projection of future oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices from our proved oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves 
in november  our borrowing base was reduced from million to million pursuant to our semi annual redetermination 
if commodity prices decline and banks lower their internal projections of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  it is possible that we will be subject to a decrease in our borrowing base availability in the future 
if our outstanding borrowings under the reserve based credit facility exceed of the borrowing base  we would be required to suspend distributions to our unitholders until we have reduced our borrowings to below the threshold 
as a result  absent accretive acquisitions  to the extent available after unitholder distributions  debt service  and capital expenditures  it is our current intention to utilize our excess cash flow during to reduce our borrowings under our financing arrangements 
based upon current expectations  we believe existing liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient for the conduct of our business and operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flow from operations net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was substantially generated from increased production volumes related to sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions which had been hedged at favorable prices generating significant realized gains on commodity derivative contracts 
changes in working capital increased total cash flows by million in compared to million in contributing to the increase in the level of cash provided by operating activities during was a million increase in accrued expenses that resulted primarily from the timing effects of payments for general operating expenses and bonuses awarded to employees 
offsetting this increase in cash flows from operating activities during was a million increase in accounts receivable related to the timing of receipts from production from the acquisitions 
unrealized derivative gains and losses are accounted for as non cash items and therefore did not impact our liquidity or cash flows provided by operating activities during the years ended december  or net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was substantially generated from increased production volumes related to dos hermanos  sun tsh and ward county acquisitions which had been hedged at favorable prices generating significant realized gains on commodity derivative contracts 
changes in working capital increased total cash flows by million in compared to decreasing total cash flows by million in contributing to the increase in the level of cash provided by operating activities during was a million increase in accrued expenses that resulted primarily from the timing effects of payments for amounts related to the phantom units granted to officers

both impairment charges and unrealized derivative gains and losses are accounted for as non cash items and therefore did not impact our liquidity or cash flows provided by operating activities during the years ended december  or our cash flow from operations is subject to many variables  the most significant of which is the volatility of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions  which are dependent on regional and worldwide economic and political activity  weather and other factors beyond our control 
future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to maintain and increase production through our drilling program and acquisitions  as well as the prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
we enter into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on operations 
currently  we use a combination of fixed price swaps  swaptions  put options and nymex collars to reduce our exposure to the volatility in oil and natural gas prices
