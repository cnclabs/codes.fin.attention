specifically  we are engaged in multiple aspects of the licensed sports products and autographed memorabilia industry through a variety of distribution channels 
we generate revenues principally from our e commerce component featuring www

revenues not material to the overall consolidated results 
organic growth dollar amounts in thousands key components of our organic growth strategy include building brand recognition  improving sales conversion rates both on our web sites and in our stores  continuing our execution of multi channel retailing under our flagship brand  fansedge  aggressively marketing our web syndication services  exploring additional distribution channels for our products  and cross pollinating corporate assets among our various operating divisions 
management believes that there remain significant benefits to cross pollinating the various corporate assets and leveraging the vertically integrated model that has been constructed over the years 
in particular  we have had success with the marketing of our products on line via fansedge 
com and the complement of each of our web properties 
the company s sales associated with these e commerce initiatives have grown from  in to  in  placing us at number in of the largest internet retailers in the nation ranking is forthcoming 
this remains the fastest growing area of the company and will remain its primary focus 
this internet growth has re defined our company as we have completed a transformation to a technology company  operating in the sports licensed products industry  generating a majority of our revenues via the ecommerce channel 
in fact  brought growth for the internet division 
the company has drawn on a complete spectrum of competencies it has developed over the years to support its flagship online brand  fansedge 
this has allowed the company to leverage the investments made during the past several years by marketing a proven range of services to third parties that include  managed hosting  custom site design and development  customer service  order fulfillment  purchasing  inventory management  marketing  merchandising  and analytics and reporting 
the company calls the compilation of e commerce services described above  web syndication and believes there are significant growth opportunities that exist in the marketplace 
our current web syndication portfolio consists of some of the best known brands and properties in the country  including jc penney  aol sports  majestic athletic  nbc sports and the philadelphia eagles  to name a few 
with the continued growth of our web syndication business model  we are leveraging the company s investment in its broad inventory by adding additional distribution channels for our products through our partner s sites 
this concurrent marketing effort is improving our inventory turns  increasing our absorption rates  and reducing overall inventory carrying costs 
commencing in june  we opened six fansedge stores in the greater chicago  il area 
our fansedge store count is currently nine 
this was in support of our multi channel retailing strategy  whereby we market a single brand via multiple channels 
we are pleased with the results to date of our fansedge brick mortar stores 
they have performed well during the slow economy as we believe they offer approachable price points for the consumer 
they cross market with the on line fansedge 
com site and benefit by a high tech inter active kiosk used in each of the fansedge stores 
furthermore  we have begun to offer this suite of multi channel retailing services to third parties who are seeking to add one or more distribution channels to their retail model 

table of contents our proprietary ecommerce platform has also enabled us to fuel a state of the art interactive kiosk for ordering products 
these kiosks are in each of our fansedge stores and are providing a unique shopping experience for our customers by allowing them to access the entire company portfolio of more than  product offerings 
in  we experienced a range of to lift in our store sales attributed to the kiosk 
the company is exploring joint venture deals with other retailers who could benefit by adding a broader range of merchandising options to their patrons by placing our kiosks within their store footprint or integrating our technology feed into their own hardware 
in fact  on february   jc penney announced that they rolled out its findmore smart fixture kiosk to over select stores across the country  featuring our sports fan shop 
we believe this expansion of our revenue producing footprint will serve us well as we navigate our business models and look to distinguish ourselves from our competitors 
objective our overall objective is twofold  to become the premier multi channel retailer in the team licensed products industry under our fansedge brand  and become the leading online syndicator for sports related properties 
analysis we review our operations based on both our financial results and various non financial measures 
management s focus in reviewing performance begins with growth in sales  margin integrity and operating income 
on the expense side  with a majority of our sales being achieved as an on line retailer of licensed sports products  we spend a disproportionate amount of our operating expenses in internet marketing 
therefore  we continuously monitor the return on investment of these particular expenses 
non financial measures which management reviews include unique visitors to our web sites  foot traffic in our stores  sales conversion rates and average sold unit prices 
during  we closed three under performing field of dreams stores as their lease terms came due and we chose not to renew 
we are targeting additional field of dreams store closings in the first quarter of we will continue to monitor the results of the remaining stores to ensure that they are providing the company with the desired results 
we believe the implementation of our multi channel retailing strategy will strengthen our fansedge brand in the marketplace  and that we are well positioned to capture increased activity of on line retail purchases 
industry experts and analysts state that currently  only of all retail sales are being conducted on line and are anticipated to increase 
on the mchannel front  we plan to continue to invest in various initiatives to leverage mobile opportunities to acquire customers online and offline  conduct mobile commerce  enhance the in store experience and connect with our customers even when they are not shopping 
currently  our e commerce platform is mobile capable and with revenues transacted from mobile devices growing exponentially  this will become a more material part of our overall revenue stream 
in the near future  we plan on releasing an enhanced mobile e commerce experience that is fully optimized for intuitive shopping via a mobile device 
after this release we expect mobile revenue to grow even faster 
additionally  we plan to continue to expand our various mobile oriented marketing programs that we use to acquire new customers and stimulate repeat purchasing from existing programs 
currently  we use programs such as local search  text alerts and other mobile oriented promotions 
we also plan to use mobile to enhance our in store experience such as using qr codes to allow in store shoppers to access customer reviews  quickly see what other teams we have available in a particular style and to quickly see what sizes we might have online that we may not have in the store 
with the continued growth of our web syndication business model  which grew from clients in to clients in  and clients in  and revenues from syndication growing from  in to over  in  and  in this figure of  is included in our internet revenues of  we are leveraging the company s investment in its broad inventory by offering the items to multiple sites simultaneously 
this should improve our inventory turnover  increase our absorption rates and reduce inventory carrying costs 
we believe there is significant opportunity in the marketplace to grow this model 
however  with the success we are experiencing with our web syndication model  we will be seeking a more quality client and have and may continue to not renew smaller accounts 
towards the end of  we acquired a ownership stake in the comet clothing company  llc 
this entity owns the rights to the zubaz brand  a line of casual sportswear with unique designs 
also  we consummated a purchase agreement for certain assets previously owned by collegiate marketing services cms 
the principal asset is the retail contract with the university of texas for the management of both the official online store and all campus event sales 
both of these initiatives were strategic in nature for the company 
we have now added the ability to manufacture soft goods apparel within the organization and will seek to produce some of the items that will be featured on many of our online shops and our partners ecommerce sites 
this should improve our overall gross margins 
in addition  with our team providing game day stadium sales for the university of texas  we are able to deliver a comprehensive retail solution to current and prospective clients that are looking for a provider who excels at ecommerce and in stadium operations and merchandising 

table of contents historically  the fourth quarter of the fiscal year october to december has accounted for a greater proportion of our operating income than have each of the other three quarters of our fiscal year 
this is primarily due to increased activities as a result of the holiday season 
we expect that we will continue to experience quarterly variations and operating results principally as a result of the seasonal nature of our industry 
management continues to seek ways to shift expenses from the non holiday quarters to the busier holiday quarter in order to improve cash flow 
other factors also cause a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results  including the timing of special events  the general popularity of a specific team that plays in a championship or an individual athlete who enters their respective sports hall of fame  the amount and timing of new sales contributed by new web syndication accounts  new stores  the timing of personal appearances by particular athletes and general economic conditions 
additional factors may cause fluctuations in expenses  including the costs associated with the opening of new stores  the integration of acquired businesses and stores into our operations  the general health of the economy  and corporate expenses needed to support our expansion and growth strategy 
conclusion we set ourselves apart from other companies with our diversified product and services line  our proprietary e commerce platform  our plethora of sports leagues and celebrity licenses  as well as our relationships with sports leagues  agents and athletes 
management believes we can continue to capture market share  especially on line

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the determination of the lower of cost or market adjustment for inventory  sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the recoverability of long lived and intangible assets  the determination of deferred income taxes  including related valuation allowances  the accrual for actual  pending or threatened litigation  claims and assessments  and assumptions related to the determination of stock based compensation in an on going basis  the company reviews its outstanding customer receivables for collectability 
adjustments to the allowance account are made according to current knowledge 
additionally  management reviews the composition of its inventory no less than annually 
reserves are adjusted accordingly 
on a quarterly basis  the company also evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
the company has both goodwill and other long lived intangible assets which are not amortized 
as prescribed by the fasb  the company evaluates the carrying value of these assets for impairment 
significant economic changes may require the company to recognize impairment 
as of december   no impairment has been necessary 
as of december   no impairment had been necessary  yet the company had taken a write down to goodwill in the amount of due to the closing of stores previously acquired that had goodwill associated with the original purchase during the second quarter of management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity collectibility of accounts receivable the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon the company s operations 
the company s current allowance for doubtful accounts is december  december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net reserves on inventories the company establishes a reserve based on historical experience and specific reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to operations results when the estimated net realizable value of inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value 
adjustments are made to the reserve based on a number of factors  such as  players changing teams  falling out of favor with the public  incurring an injury  etc 
these negative situations may impact valuation 
however  dynamics that could increase inventory value  like the death of an athlete  do not result in writing up of inventory values

table of contents income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing the company s provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates quarterly its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
the company provides a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the company has prepared an analysis based upon historical data and forecasted earnings projections to determine its ability to realize its net deferred tax asset 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  management has determined that a valuation allowance of as of december   was necessary 
the change in the valuation allowance for the current year is goodwill and unamortized intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic intangibles goodwill and other goodwill subsequent measure  the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair value 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value

revenues from the sale of franchises are deferred until the company fulfills its obligations under the franchise agreement and the franchised unit opens 
the franchise agreements provide for continuing royalty fees based on a percentage of gross receipts 
management fee revenue related to the representation and marketing of professional athletes is recognized when earned and is reflected net of its related costs of sales 
the majority of the revenue generated from the representation and marketing of professional athletes relates to services as an agent 
in these arrangements  the company is not the primary obligor in these transactions but rather only receives a net agent fee 
revenues from industry trade shows are recognized at the time of the show when tickets are submitted for autographs or actual product purchases take place 
in instances when the company receives pre payments for show autographs  the company records these amounts as deferred revenue 
the company partnered in a corporate rebate program with a national consumer goods retailer 
the company issued rebate coupons for which it was pre paid of the coupon value 
certificates redeemed through march   were recognized as revenue in the period 
additionally  a breakage model was projected for the program s eight month term  based upon redemption totals redeemed through april   the program s termination date 
thus  the company recognized breakage revenue over the seven months september march  of the program

new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb amended guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  consolidation 
fasb asc topic changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be re characterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity 
the amendment of fasb asc topic establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for non controlling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary 
fasb asc topic is effective for us on a prospective basis for business combinations with an acquisition date beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of fasb asc topic as amended did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb amended its guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  equity stock dividends and stock splits  to clarify that the stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to receive cash or stock with a limit on the amount of cash that will be distributed is not a stock dividend for purposes of applying topics and these provisions of fasb asc topic are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  and  accordingly  are effective for us for the current fiscal reporting period
