item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  and use of the terms rocky  the company  we  us and our in this discussion refer to rocky brands  inc and its subsidiaries 
our fiscal year begins on january and ends on december we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  our credit facility  and contractual commitments 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements which we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere herein 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of below 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
executive overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of well recognized brand names including rocky  georgia boot  durango  lehigh  and the licensed brands mossy oak and michelin 
our products are distributed through three distinct business segments wholesale  retail and military 
in our wholesale business  we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels representing over ten thousand retail store locations in the us and canada 
our wholesale channels vary by product line and include sporting goods stores  outdoor retailers  independent shoe retailers  hardware stores  catalogs  mass merchants  uniform stores  farm store chains  specialty safety stores and other specialty retailers 
our retail business includes direct sales of our products to consumers through our lehigh mobile stores and our websites 
we also sell footwear under the rocky label to the us military 
our growth strategy is founded substantially on the expansion of our brands into new footwear and apparel markets 
new products that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or one or more of our brands may fall out of favor with consumers 
if we are unable to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences  we may not grow as fast as we plan to grow or our sales may decline  and our brand image and operating performance may suffer 
furthermore  achieving market acceptance for new products will likely require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts  which could result in a material increase in our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses  and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts 
material increases in our sg a expenses could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we may also encounter difficulties in producing new products that we did not anticipate during the development stage 
our development schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change as a result of shifting priorities in response to consumer preferences and competing products 
if we are not able to efficiently manufacture newly developed products in quantities sufficient to support retail distribution  we may not be able to recoup our investment in the development of new products 
failure to gain market acceptance for new products that we introduce could impede our growth  reduce our profits  adversely affect the image of our brands  erode our competitive position and result in long term harm to our business 
financial summary net sales of the wholesale segment increased million in over prior year primarily as a result of increased sales in our work footwear category

these actions involved the relocation of our wholesale division s customer care function from franklin  tennessee to nelsonville  ohio  and the closing of underperforming mini stores in our retail division 
these charges were composed of severance and employee benefits related costs  transition costs  and facility exit costs  which includes facility shut down and lease contract termination costs 
non cash intangible impairment charges 
our evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets indicated that none of these assets were impaired 
as a result of our annual evaluation of intangible assets  in we recognized impairment losses on the carrying values of the lehigh and gates trademarks of million and million  respectively 
we recognized tax benefits relating to the lehigh and gates trademark impairments of million and million  respectively 
we estimated fair value based on projections of the future cash flows for each of the trademarks 
we then compared the carrying value for each trademark to its estimated fair value 
since the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value  we recognized the reductions in fair value as non cash intangible impairment charges in our operating expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million for the prior year

in  we recognized a million benefit relating to the non cash intangible impairment charge of million  a million reduction in income tax expense related to the filing of the federal income tax return  and  a million reduction in income tax expense related to an adjustment of state deferred tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have been our income from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and other indebtedness 
over the last several years our principal uses of cash have been for working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth 
our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory  offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of january through march of each year and highest during the months of may through october of each year 
we typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital requirements 
as a result  balances on our revolving credit facility will fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
our working capital increased to million at december   compared to million at the end of the prior year 
our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our corporate offices  property  merchandising fixtures  molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology 
capital expenditures were million for and million in capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million 
in march  we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility with gmac commercial finance gmac which was set to expire on january  the size of the facility was reduced to million from million and the maturity date was extended to april  the interest rates for the term of this amendment were libor plus or prime plus  at our option 
the financing costs associated with this amendment totaled approximately million 
in may  the company completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds from the offering of million after deducting million in underwriting discounts and million in expenses 
the proceeds were used to prepay amounts due under term loans with laminar direct capital lp and whitebox hedged high yield partners  lp in connection with this transaction  million of prepayment fees and million of non cash charges related to deferred financing fees were incurred and have been reflected as a component of interest expense 
in may  we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility with gmac to advance million to the company under the existing revolving portion of its credit facility to prepay amounts due under term loans with laminar direct capital lp and whitebox hedged high yield partners  lp after the prepayment  principal under the term loans totaled million in the aggregate 
the term loans had an interest rate of payable semi annually over the five year term of the notes 
principal repayment was due at maturity in may the interest rate for the revolving portion of the company s credit facility was libor plus 
in connection with this transaction  million of prepayment fees and million of non cash charges related to deferred financing fees were incurred and have been reflected as a component of interest expense 
in october  we entered into a new financing agreement with pnc bank pnc to provide a million credit facility that replaced the existing revolving credit facility with gmac 
in addition  the new financing agreement with pnc was used to repay the remaining balance of approximately million under the term loans 
the term of the new credit facility is five years and the initial interest rate is generally libor plus 
in connection with this transaction  we incurred additional interest expense of million in the fourth quarter comprised of million of prepayment fees and million of non cash charges related to deferred financing fees 
the financing costs associated with this amendment totaled approximately million 
the total amount available on our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under this facility and total capacity of million 
our credit facility contains a restrictive covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio 
this restrictive covenant is only in effect upon a triggering event taking place as defined in the credit facility agreement 
at december   there was no triggering event and the covenant was not in effect 
our credit facility places a restriction on the amount of dividends that may be paid 
at december   we had no retained earnings available for the payment of dividends 
we believe that our new credit facility coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our continued liquidity  however  is contingent upon future operating performance  cash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facility 
based on our expected borrowings for  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the subsequent twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million in income before income taxes and cash flows 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable debt and assume no changes in the composition of that debt 
cash flows cash flow summary in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for  compared to million for  and million for the principal sources of net cash in included higher net income and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  partially offset by slightly higher balances of inventory and accounts receivable 
the principal sources of net cash in included decreases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventory offset by decreases of million in accounts payable 
the net cash provided for was positively impacted by unusually higher inventory levels at the end of that decreased to normal levels by the end of the principal sources of net cash in included decreases of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory and million in income taxes receivable offset by decreases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued and other liabilities 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the principal use of cash in  and was for the purchase of molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology software and system upgrades 
financing activities

future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are million  million  million and million for years through  respectively  and million for  or approximately million in total 
we continually evaluate our external credit arrangements in light of our growth strategy and new opportunities 
in october  we entered into a new financing agreement with pnc bank pnc to provide a million credit facility that replaced the existing revolving credit facility with gmac 
in addition  the new financing agreement with pnc was used to repay the remaining balance of approximately million under the term loans 
the term of the new credit facility is five years and the initial interest rate is generally libor plus 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  resulting from financial contracts and commitments 
we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts are generally consistent from year to year  closely reflect our levels of production  and are not long term in nature less than three months 
contractual obligations at december  payments due by year millions total less than year years years over years long term debt minimum operating lease commitments minimum royalty commitments expected cash requirements for interest total contractual obligations assumes the following interest rates which are consistent with rates as of december  on the million revolving credit facility  and on the million mortgage loans 
from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
additionally  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
inflation our financial performance is influenced by factors such as higher raw material costs as well as higher salaries and employee benefits 
management attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
we were able to mitigate the effects of inflation during due to these factors 
it is anticipated that inflationary pressures during will be offset through price increases implemented in the beginning of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our management regularly reviews our accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles  pension benefits and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue principally consists of sales to customers  and  to a lesser extent  license fees 
revenue is recognized when goods are shipped and title passes to the customer  while license fees are recognized when earned 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on the relative age and size of trade receivable balances 
sales returns and allowances we record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances 
these reductions are influenced by historical experience  based on customer returns and allowances 
the actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased  then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
sales returns and allowances for sales returns were approximately and of sales for and  respectively 
inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable and we have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories at amounts above cost through our factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
intangible assets intangible assets  including goodwill  trademarks and patents are reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently  if necessary 
we perform such testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
in assessing whether indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows  long term growth rates of our business  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital and other factors such as  discount rates  royalty rates  cost of capital  and market multiples to determine the fair value of our assets 
these estimates and assumptions require management s judgment  and changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or impairment for each of our other indefinite lived intangible assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that indications of intangible asset impairment exist 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of our business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  competition  or the sale or disposition of a reporting segment 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
pension benefits accounting for pensions involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements for information on our plan and the assumptions used 
pension expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of december each year 
the funded status of our plan and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december actual results would be different using other assumptions 
on december  we froze the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all non us territorial employees 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying plan assets could result in losses or a higher accrual 
income taxes management has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net operating losses that it believes may not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   approximately million of undistributed earnings remains that would become taxable upon repatriation to the united states

this standard  as modified  addresses the effects on certain provisions relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities  as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept in the accounting standard related to transfers and servicing  and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of this standard  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the standard do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this standard  as modified  is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter

accounting standards not yet adopted in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards updated  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
this update eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and allows the use of an entity best estimate to determine the selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence cannot be determined 
this update also requires additional disclosure to provide both qualitative and quantitative information regarding the significant judgments made in applying this update 
in addition  for each reporting period in the initial year of adoption  this update requires disclosure of the amount of revenue recognized subject to the measurement requirements of this update and the amount of revenue that would have been recognized if the related transactions were subject to the measurement requirements prior to this update

 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
this asu reflects the decision reached in eitf issue no 
a 
the amendments in this asu modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of this rule on our consolidated financial statements
