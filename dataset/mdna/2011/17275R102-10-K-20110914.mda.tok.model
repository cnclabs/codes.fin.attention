overview we design  manufacture  and sell internet protocol ip based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology it industry and provide services associated with these products and their use 
our products and services are designed to address a wide range of customers needs  including improving productivity  reducing costs  and gaining a competitive advantage 
in addition  our products and services are designed to help customers build their own network infrastructures that support tools and applications that allow them to communicate with key stakeholders  including customers  prospects  business partners  suppliers  and employees 
we focus on delivering networking products and solutions that are designed to simplify and secure customers network infrastructures 
we believe that integrating multiple network services into our products helps our customers reduce their total cost of network ownership 
our product offerings fall into the following four categories our two core technology categories  routing and switching  new products  and other products 
in addition to our product offerings  we provide a broad range of service offerings  including technical support services and advanced services 
our customer base spans virtually all types of public and private agencies and businesses  including enterprise businesses including public sector entities  service providers  commercial customers  and consumers 
a summary of our results is as follows in millions  except percentages and per share amounts fiscal fiscal variance net sales gross margin percentage pts research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total r d  sales and marketing  general and administrative total as a percentage of revenue pts amortization of purchased intangible assets restructuring and other charges nm operating margin percentage pts net income net income as a percentage of revenue pts earnings per share diluted 
table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased  with net product sales increasing and service revenue increasing 
we experienced net sales increases across each of our geographic segments for both product and service revenue 
total gross margin declined by percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing  product mix shifts  increased amortization and impairment charges from acquisition related intangible assets  and restructuring charges 
as a percentage of revenue  the total for research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses increased by percentage points  primarily as a result of increased headcount related costs 
total charges for restructuring and other in fiscal totaled million  which consisted of million recorded to cost of sales and million recorded to operating expenses 
diluted earnings per share decreased by  a result of a decrease in net income  partially offset by a decline in our diluted share count of million shares 
for further details  see our discussion of fiscal  and beginning on page during fiscal net sales increased as compared to fiscal  however  our results for the year reflect the effects of certain challenges that we faced 
we identified challenges with the public sector market early in the year and we continued to experience declining business momentum with that market throughout the year as spending reductions were being taken across virtually all developed markets 
in the service provider market  we experienced challenges in sales of traditional set top boxes 
in addition  we experienced challenges with regard to switching  as switching revenue was flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the performance in switching was due to continued transitions taking place in our product portfolio  the lower public sector spending  and the impact of increased competitive pressures 
in fiscal switching gross margins declined on a year over year basis due to the transition of products at the high end of the portfolio 
we also identified significant pressures in our consumer market during the fiscal year and addressed these issues with targeted actions  as discussed below 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated a number of key  targeted actions that are intended to accomplish the following simplify and focus our organization and operating model  align our cost structure to the transitions in the marketplace  divest or exit underperforming operations  and deliver value to our shareholders 
we are taking these actions to align our business based on five foundational priorities leadership in our core business routing  switching  and associated services  which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions  collaboration  data center virtualization and cloud  video  and architectures for business transformation 
in connection with these activities  we incurred restructuring and other charges  as discussed above  in the second half of fiscal  and we have announced that we will incur additional charges in fiscal these actions include implementing a voluntary early retirement program  effecting a workforce reduction  and realigning and restructuring our consumer business  most notably exiting our flip video cameras product line 
we anticipate that our total expense reduction actions will reduce our annualized operating expense run rate by approximately billion  with the fourth quarter of fiscal operating expenses as our base 
we expect to achieve this annualized run rate reduction target within fiscal while we experienced the challenges outlined above  there were several positive aspects to our fiscal performance 
for fiscal  the emerging markets segment experienced revenue growth of 
we had strong growth in our commercial market and in our enterprise market excluding the public sector 
positive aspects of our results for fiscal also included revenue growth in new products of  with strong growth of in collaboration which includes the impact of the tandberg asa tandberg acquisition completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal and in data center  both key strategic areas for us 
for fiscal  service revenue increased by 
in addition  as we focused on and addressed the items that impacted our financial performance in the first three quarters of fiscal  in the fourth quarter of fiscal there was improvement in our general business momentum 

table of contents strategy and focus areas we announced a plan in may  which we began implementing in fiscal and expect to complete in fiscal  to realign our sales  services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model and focus on our five foundational priorities leadership in our core business routing  switching  and associated services which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video architectures for business transformation we believe that focusing on these priorities will best position us to continue to expand our share of our customers information technology spending 
we are currently undergoing product transitions in our core business and introducing next generation products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared to both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors 
we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong year over year product revenue growth across these next generation product families 
we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and  therefore  may continue to provide us with long term growth opportunities 
however  we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins  which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering  effective supply chain management  and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware  software  and services 
we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions 
market transitions on which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualization the cloud  video  collaboration  networked mobility technologies and the transition from internet protocol version to internet protocol version for example  a market in which a significant market transition is under way is the enterprise data center market  where a transition to virtualization the cloud is rapidly evolving 
there is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness 
we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating  due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization  the rise in scalable processing  and the advent of cloud computing and cloud based it resource deployments and business models 
these key terms are defined as follows virtualization refers to the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified  shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus enabling the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network 
the cloud refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which resources  such as servers or software applications  are no longer tethered to a user s physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user on demand as an internet based service  whether singularly or with multiple other users simultaneously 
this virtualization and cloud driven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking  computing  storage  and software technologies 
we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through  among other things  our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families  which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture 
we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloud based product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloud based it solutions  including software as a service saas and other as a service xaas solutions 

table of contents the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing 
very large  well financed  and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market 
we expect this competitive market trend to continue 
with respect to this market  we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards 
we expect to see acquisitions  further industry consolidation  and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market 
as we enter this next market phase  we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances  compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners  and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 
other market transitions on which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the increased role of video  collaboration  and networked mobility technologies 
the key market transitions relative to the convergence of video  collaboration  and networked mobility technologies  which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads  appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated 
cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video  collaboration  and networked mobility technologies  as customers evolve their communications and business models 
we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation  distribution  and use of end to end video solutions for businesses and consumers 
we believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in the past in addressing market opportunities in the communications and it industry will be adaptable to other markets 
an example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility  where growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures  equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users  but also increased user demand for broadband quality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices 
revenue for fiscal  total revenue increased by 
within total revenue  net product revenue increased and net service revenue increased  each as compared with fiscal with regard to our geographic segment performance  net revenue increased in the united states and canada segment  in our european markets segment  in our emerging markets segment  and in our asia pacific markets segment 
customer market product revenue performance in fiscal was driven by increases  in order of largest percentage growth  in our commercial  service provider  and enterprise markets 
our consumer market experienced a large revenue decline in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  as we exited the flip video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products 
the increase in product revenue was driven by growth across most of our product categories 
in particular  our new products category experienced a revenue increase of  primarily as a result of the acquisition of tandberg  which was completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal within the new products category  increased revenue was driven by growth of in data center and revenue growth of in collaboration 
in our core product categories we experienced revenue growth of in routers  principally as a result of strength in the high end router product offerings  and flat revenue in our switches product category  with single digit revenue growth in fixed configuration switching products being offset by a similar revenue decline in modular switches 
the net service revenue increase was experienced across the technical support services and advanced services categories with revenue increases of and  respectively  in fiscal as compared with fiscal for further details see our discussion of fiscal  and beginning on page gross margin in fiscal  our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately percentage points  as compared with fiscal within this total gross margin change  product gross margin declined by percentage points  while service gross margin increased by percentage points 
the decrease in our product gross margin percentage was a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing  unfavorable product mix  and 
table of contents restructuring and other charges 
additionally  increased amortization expense and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets contributed to the decline in product gross margin 
partially offsetting these decreases were lower overall manufacturing costs and higher shipment volume 
the increase in our service gross margin was due to increased volume  partially offset by increased costs and unfavorable mix impacts 
for further details see our discussion of fiscal  and beginning on page operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  increased by 
in fiscal  research and development expenses increased  sales and marketing expenses increased  while general and administrative expenses were down slightly 
the collective increase was primarily a result of higher headcount related expenses 
this increase was partially offset by the impact from the fiscal period containing one less week compared with the fiscal period 
operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points  primarily as a result of restructuring and other charges and the higher headcount related charges along with increased expense from purchased intangible asset amortization and impairments 
other key financial measures the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal we generated cash flows from operations of billion  compared with billion in fiscal our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were billion at the end of fiscal  compared with billion at the end of fiscal our total deferred revenue at the end of was billion  compared with billion at the end of fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of billion during fiscal as of the end of fiscal  the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the stock repurchase program was billion with no termination date 
we also declared and paid dividends of million to our shareholders during fiscal days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso at the end of fiscal was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal our inventory balance was billion at the end of fiscal  compared with billion at the end of fiscal annualized inventory turns were in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with in the fourth quarter of fiscal our product backlog at the end of fiscal was billion  or of fiscal net sales  compared with billion at the end of fiscal  or of fiscal net sales 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
contracts  internet commerce agreements  and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables  such as sales of products that include services  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting  and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price 
revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and  if so  our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables 
according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units  when available 
we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by approximately of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus of the median selling price 
vsoe exists across most of our product and service offerings 
in certain limited circumstances when vsoe does not exist  we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple deliverable arrangements 
under the selling price hierarchy  third party evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist  and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our markets  and the extent of customization varies among comparable products or services from our peers 
in determining esp  we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company specific factors such as geographies  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing  and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 
some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components 
such sale arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc  software revenue recognition 
as our business and offerings evolve over time  our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp  in subsequent periods 
there were no material impacts during fiscal  nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe  tpe  or esp 
revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements  service  support  and other factors 
financing arrangements may include sales type  direct financing  and operating leases  loans  and guarantees of third party financing 
our deferred revenue for products was billion as of both july  and july  technical support services revenue is deferred and 
table of contents recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed  which typically is from one to three years 
advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
our deferred revenue for services was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
we make sales to distributors and retail partners and generally recognize revenue based on a sell through method using information provided by them 
our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs  and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs 
if actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on historical experience  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowances for receivables and sales returns the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions  except percentages july  july  allowance for doubtful accounts percentage of gross accounts receivable allowance for credit loss lease receivables percentage of gross lease receivables allowance for credit loss loan receivables percentage of gross loan receivables the allowances are based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience  credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay  historical default rates  and long term historical loss rates published by major third party credit rating agencies 
we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances 
in addition  we evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables and any associated allowance for credit loss by applying the relevant loss factors based on our internal credit risk rating for the respective financing receivables  disaggregated by segment and class 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
determination of loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings is complex and subjective 
our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future  which could adversely affect our net income 
similarly  if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 
both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 
the decline in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable was primarily due to the charge off of certain uncollectible receivables that had been fully reserved 
a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates 
the reserve for future sales returns as of july  and july  was million and million  respectively  and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers our inventory balance was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market  based upon assumptions about future demand  and are charged to the provision for inventory  which is a 
table of contents component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we record a liability for firm  noncancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 
as of july   the liability for these purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of july   and was included in other current liabilities 
our provision for inventory was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for inventory and the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due in part to charges recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business 
additionally  the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased due to higher provisions related to certain component supplies that we secured for our extended needs  and due to higher contract manufacturer excess and obsolescence charges 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory write downs  and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected 
we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments 
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence  particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties  included in other current liabilities  was million as of july   compared with million as of july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to five years  and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 
the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense is presented as follows in millions years ended july  july  july  share based compensation expense prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on march   the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of as we did not historically pay 
table of contents cash dividends on our common stock 
for awards granted on or subsequent to march   we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights  these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  and expected dividends as of the grant date 
for employee stock options  we used the implied volatility for two year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice binomial model 
for employee stock purchase rights  we used the implied volatility for traded options with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights on our stock 
the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness  which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates  the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 
fair value measurements our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities  collectively  are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of billion as of july   compared with billion as of july  our fixed income investment portfolio  as of july   consisted primarily of high quality investment grade securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent  objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments 
it encompasses three classes of investments level consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities  level consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used  such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from  or corroborated by  observable market data  and level consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our level securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  and other similar data  which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices  or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we use such pricing data as the primary input  to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal and fiscal  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio 
we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information  and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value 
the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 
however  given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio  and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets  we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was 
table of contents material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july  level assets do not represent a significant portion of our total investment portfolio as of july  other than temporary impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
the ultimate value realized on these securities  to the extent unhedged  is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost  we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis  or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security 
if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence  the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings 
if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii  the amount representing credit loss  defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security  will be recognized in earnings  and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected  we consider all available information  including past events  current conditions  the remaining payment terms of the security  the financial condition of the issuer  expected defaults  and the value of underlying collateral 
for publicly traded equity securities  we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
there were no significant impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal and there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal and in fiscal  impairment charges of million for investments in fixed income securities and publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings 
our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could adversely affect our net income 
we also have investments in privately held companies  some of which are in the startup or development stages 
as of july   our investments in privately held companies were million  compared with million as of july   and were included in other assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required  based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospects of these companies 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date  which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired  including contingent consideration 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
effective in fiscal  the assessment 
table of contents of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the pending divestiture of our manufacturing operations in juarez  mexico  we recorded an adjustment of million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations 
there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal  or the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately billion for the asia pacific markets segment to approximately billion for the united states and canada segment as of july  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of july  would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could adversely affect our net income 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate  primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes  foreign operations  research and development r d tax credits  tax audit settlements  nondeductible compensation  international realignments  and transfer pricing adjustments 
our effective tax rate was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event 
table of contents that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit laws  by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  by tax costs related to intercompany realignments  by changes in accounting principles  or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income  or the foreign tax credit rules 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
further  as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments  our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax 
our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
third parties  including customers  have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark  and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us 
these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions  particularly in the united states 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

our net sales  which include product and service revenue for each segment are summarized in the following table in millions  except percentages years ended july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent net sales united states and canada percentage of net sales european markets percentage of net sales emerging markets percentage of net sales asia pacific markets percentage of net sales total fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  net sales increased by 
within total net sales growth  net product sales increased by  while service revenue increased by 
our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments 
the sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core business  sales growth in our new products category  and the strong performance of our services solutions 
we conduct business globally in numerous currencies 
the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non us customers and thereby reduces demand 
a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect 
however  the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors  including a reduced it spending environment and budget driven reductions in spending by government entities  net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition  including the complexity of transactions 
table of contents such as multiple element arrangements  the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers  and final acceptance of the product  system  or solution  among other factors 
in addition  certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases  and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition  which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment 
as has been the case in our emerging markets segment from time to time  customers require greater levels of financing arrangements  service  and support and this may occur in future periods  which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal as compared with fiscal in our view  the sales increase in fiscal was a result of the global demand recovery during fiscal in comparison to the weakness we experienced for most of fiscal we had an increase in both net product sales and service revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal from a customer market perspective  in fiscal we saw an improved demand environment for capital expenditures and balanced growth across all of our customer markets

net product sales increased in the united states and increased in canada 
the increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the united states and canada segment  led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market  followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets 
net product sales in the consumer market declined during fiscal as we exited the flip video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products 
within the enterprise market  net product sales to the us public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the us federal government  while sales to the state and local government submarket were flat 
the challenges experienced in fiscal within the public sector submarket of our enterprise market may continue into fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net product sales in the united states and canada segment increased during fiscal compared with fiscal due to the improvement in the economic environment in this segment

fiscal compared with fiscal the slight increase in net product sales in the european markets segment in fiscal compared with fiscal was driven by increased sales across most of our customer markets in this segment  with particular strength in the enterprise and commercial markets 
from a country perspective  net product sales increased in the united kingdom and france while decreasing for both germany and italy compared with fiscal our european markets segment grew more slowly relative to other segments on a year over year basis  which we believe was attributable in part to the fact that many of the countries in this segment were among the last countries to begin experiencing the economic downturn in fiscal  and consequently some of these countries are recovering later 
product sales growth in this segment began to strengthen in the second half of fiscal during fiscal we did not see significant negative effects on our net product sales in the european markets segment from the economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain european countries 
emerging markets fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  net product sales in the emerging markets segment increased by 
the net product sales increase was led by a sales increase in the commercial market followed by sales increases in the service provider and enterprise markets 
net product sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal  as compared with fiscal from a country perspective  net product sales increased by approximately in russia  in brazil  and in mexico 
fiscal compared with fiscal net product sales in the emerging markets segment increased  primarily as a result of increased product sales across all of our customer markets  with the exception of the consumer market

we may continue to experience challenging conditions in the public sector market in fiscal from a country perspective  net product sales increased by approximately in india  in china  in australia  and in japan 
fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in net product sales in the asia pacific markets segment in fiscal compared with fiscal was attributable to increased product sales to our enterprise  commercial  and service provider markets in this segment 
in fiscal we experienced strength in most countries  including china  australia and japan  each of which is among the largest countries in this segment 
net product sales by groups of similar products in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis  we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes 
effective as of the first quarter of fiscal  we have regrouped our presentation of products and technologies formerly grouped as either advanced technologies or other into two new categories called new products and other products 
the new products category includes some products that had previously been grouped in the category called advanced technology products and also includes some products that had previously been in the category called other 
the new products category consists of the following subcategories video connected home networked home  pure digital products  video systems  and cable products  collaboration unified communications and cisco telepresence  security  wireless  and data center application networking services  storage  and cisco unified computing system products 
the other products category consists primarily of optical networking products and emerging technology products

for fiscal as compared with fiscal  growth in sales of our routers product category was driven by an  or million  increase in sales of our high end routers 
within high end router products  the increase was driven by higher sales of cisco aggregation services routers asr products from our december acquisition of starent and higher sales of the cisco asr and cisco asr products 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cisco series routers and cisco series routers 
for fiscal  midrange and low end routers each increased sales by  or million  and million  respectively  compared with fiscal small office routing experienced a small revenue decline 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal our sales of routers increased in our high end category in fiscal by  or million  while sales of routers declined in both the midrange and low end categories by and  respectively 
within the high end router category  the increase was driven by higher sales of the cisco crs carrier routing system  cisco series routers  and cisco asr and products  and the inclusion of the cisco asr products from our acquisition of starent  partially offset by lower sales of cisco series routers 
our decline in sales of midrange and low end routers was primarily due to a decline in sales of our integrated services routers 
switches fiscal compared with fiscal net product sales in our switches product category were relatively flat in fiscal compared with fiscal  which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio  lower public sector spending  and the impact of increased competitive pressures 
since approximately of our switching business is derived from sales to the public sector  reductions in public sector spending in developed markets around the world could continue to present challenges for our switching sales performance 
within our switches product category  higher sales of lan fixed configuration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches 
sales of lan fixed configuration switches increased  or million  while sales of modular switches decreased  or million 
the increase in lan fixed configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst series switches and cisco nexus and series switches  partially offset by decreased sales of cisco catalyst and series switches 
the decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of cisco catalyst series switches  partially offset by increased sales of cisco nexus and cisco catalyst series switches 
fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in net product sales related to switches in fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to higher sales of our modular and lan fixed configuration switches of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in sales of modular switches was primarily due to the increased sales of our cisco nexus and cisco catalyst series switches  partially offset by decreased sales of our cisco catalyst series switches 
the increase in lan fixed configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst series switches and cisco nexus and series switches  partially offset by decreased sales of our cisco catalyst series switches 
new products fiscal compared with fiscal sales of collaboration products increased by  or million  primarily due to the inclusion of tandberg sales within our cisco telepresence systems product line following our fiscal third quarter acquisition of tandberg  and a increase in sales of unified communications products  primarily ip phones and collaborative web based offerings 
sales of data center products increased by  or million  due to sales growth of over  or million  of cisco unified computing system products and due to storage sales growth of  or million  attributable to increased sales of our cisco mds product line 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of application networking services products 
sales of wireless products increased by  or million  which was primarily due to continued customer adoption of and migration to the cisco unified wireless network architecture 
sales of video connected home products were relatively flat 
sales of service provider video products increased by  or million  as increased sales of cable and cable modem products of and 
table of contents  respectively  were offset by a sales decline in video systems of 
the increased sales of service provider video products were partially offset by lower sales of virtual home products  due to a decline of in sales of networked home products and due to an decline in sales of flip video cameras  attributable to our exit of the video camera business in the third quarter of fiscal sales of security products decreased by  or million 
our decreased sales of security products were the result of lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and lan switches  partially offset by increased sales of our web and email security products 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales of video connected home products increased by approximately million due to increased sales of million of flip video cameras attributable to our pure digital acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal  along with a million increase in sales of cable products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in sales of networked home products  primarily due to lower sales of routers and adapters  and due to a decline of million in sales of video systems  primarily attributable to lower sales for digital set top boxes 
sales of collaboration products increased by approximately million due to an increase of million in sales of unified communications products  primarily due to higher sales of ip phones and associated software  and higher sales of our web based collaboration offerings 
the increase in collaboration products was also due to a sales increase of million in cisco telepresence systems products  which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of tandberg completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal sales of security products increased by approximately million 
our increased sales of security products were a result of increased sales of our web and email security products as well as our security appliance products  each of which integrates multiple technologies including virtual private network vpn  firewall  and intrusion prevention services on one platform  partially offset by lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and lan switches 
sales of data center products increased by approximately million due to an increase of million in sales of cisco unified computing system products and an increase of million in sales of storage area networking products 
the increase in sales of storage products resulted primarily from higher sales of our cisco mds product line 
sales of application networking services declined  however  the decline was offset by higher server virtualization sales 
sales of wireless products increased by approximately million  primarily due to increases in the customer adoption of and migration to the cisco unified wireless network architecture

technical support services revenue increased  and advanced services  which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs  experienced revenue growth 
technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with particular strength in emerging markets and asia pacific markets 
growth in each of our united states and canada and our european markets segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth 
renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced  which was the primary driver for these increases 
we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments  with strong growth in our asia pacific markets  european markets  and emerging markets segments  followed by slower growth in our united states and canada segment 
total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of tandberg and starent during fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal  with particular strength in our asia pacific markets 
the increase in total service revenue was due to growth from technical support services as well as increased revenue from advanced services 
technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments  with solid growth in our asia pacific markets and european markets segments 
in fiscal  we experienced advanced services revenue growth across each of our geographic segments except for our emerging markets segment 
total service revenue growth in fiscal also benefited from incremental revenue from our acquisitions during fiscal of tandberg and starent 
renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales during fiscal have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced  contributing to these increases 

table of contents gross margin the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions  except percentages amount percentage years ended july  july  july  july  july  july  gross margin product service total product gross margin fiscal compared with fiscal the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal product gross margin percentage fiscal sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing mix of products sold amortization of purchased intangible assets restructuring and other charges overall manufacturing costs shipment volume  net of certain variable costs fiscal in fiscal  product gross margin decreased by percentage points 
the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates  and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue 
these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments 
additionally  our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products 
higher year over year impairment charges related to acquisition related intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges  both primarily in the consumer business  also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage 
these negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume 
the lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing  continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations  and value engineering 
value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign  board configuration  test processes  and transformation processes 
our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins  such as cisco unified computing system products 
our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or  as was the case in fiscal and  by increased sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing  which may be attributable to competitive factors 
additionally  our manufacturing related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain 
if any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods  our product and service gross margins could continue to decline

the product gross margin for fiscal also benefited from the increase in shipment volume 
a favorable product mix contributed slightly to the increase in product gross margin percentage 
fiscal product gross margin was negatively impacted by sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing  which were driven by normal market factors  as well as the geographic mix of product revenue 
the impact from sales discounts  rebates and product pricing was within our expected range 
service gross margin fiscal compared with fiscal our service gross margin percentage increased by percentage points for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins 
the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume 
partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts  primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal and due to increased service delivery costs 
gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcount related cost impacts 
these benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs  particularly from outside services 
advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs  which were partially headcount related 
our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers networking devices  applications  and infrastructures 
our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals  our strategic investments in headcount  and resources to support the overall service business 
other factors include the mix of service offerings  as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 
fiscal compared with fiscal our service gross margin percentage was unchanged from fiscal due to higher margins for technical support services offset by a decline in the gross margin for advanced services 
the increase in technical support service gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of increased volume 
technical support margins will experience some variability due to various factors such as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals as well as the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 
the decrease in advanced services gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased headcount costs  partially offset by higher volume

we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 
fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts  rebates  and unfavorable pricing  as well as due to a product mix shift 
these declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments 
the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate  and period to period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 
our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities  and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 
fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  the gross margin percentage in the united states and canada segment declined compared with fiscal  primarily due to higher sales discounts and a lower service gross margin 
the decline was partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs 
the gross margin percentage in the european markets segment increased during fiscal compared with fiscal due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs  increased shipment volume and favorable product mix 
the increase in this segment was partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts 
in fiscal  the gross margin percentage in the emerging markets segment increased compared with fiscal due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs  partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts 
the gross margin percentage in the asia pacific markets segment increased during fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to higher shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs 
gross margin in the asia pacific markets segment also benefited from favorable mix shifts in japan 
partially offsetting this increase was the impact of higher sales discounts 
for each of our segments  the negative impact of sales discounts  rebates and product pricing was driven by normal market factors and was within our expected range 
factors that may impact net sales and gross margin net product sales may continue to be affected by factors  including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty  that have resulted in reduced or cautious spending in our global enterprise  service provider  and commercial markets  changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions  competition  
table of contents including price focused competitors from asia  especially from china  new product introductions  sales cycles and product implementation cycles  changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets  changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales  variations in sales channels  and final acceptance criteria of the product  system  or solution as specified by the customer 
sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases  especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our new products category 
in addition  service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles  require a broader range of services  including network design services  and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition 
certain of our customers in the emerging markets segment also tend to make large and sporadic purchases  and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition 
as we focus on new market opportunities  customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements  service  and support  especially in the emerging markets segment  which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 
to improve customer satisfaction  we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead time performance  which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog 
a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter to quarter net sales and operating results 
net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products  especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses  whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market  price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry  introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products  adoption of new networking standards  and financial difficulties experienced by our customers 
we may  from time to time  experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers ability to provide specific components  resulting in delayed shipments 
to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future  and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity  it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter 
for additional factors that may impact net product sales  see part i  item a 
risk factors 
our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs 
increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and  to a certain degree  the timing of orders from our customers 
we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sell through method using information provided by them  and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 
product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold  including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products  introduction of new products  including products with price performance advantages  our ability to reduce production costs  entry into new markets  including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures  as a result of internal development or through acquisitions  changes in distribution channels  price competition  including competitors from asia  especially those from china  changes in geographic mix of our product sales  the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  sales discounts  increases in material or labor costs  including share based compensation expense  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  warranty costs  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing  effects of value engineering  inventory holding charges  and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans 
additionally  our manufacturing related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain 
service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals  share based compensation expense  and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business

amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses in millions years ended july  july  july  amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of million in fiscal  partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized 
the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products 
for fiscal  the decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was primarily due to lower impairment charges in fiscal as compared with fiscal  partially offset by increased amortization of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions completed during fiscal for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of acquired technology and patents  as well as acquired technology under development  is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate 
we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high technology communications industry  and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets

our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes

liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet  contractual obligations  other commitments  and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions july  july  increase cash and cash equivalents fixed income securities publicly traded equity securities total the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of billion  a slight decrease from billion in fiscal  and debt issuances of billion  net of repayments 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans of billion  capital expenditures of billion  and cash dividends paid of billion 
the slight decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in net income and the unfavorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from increased financing receivables  partially offset by the favorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from lower accounts receivable 
our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
the remaining balance held in the united states as of july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
under current tax laws and regulations  if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the united states were to be distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
we classify our investments as short term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong  with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment 
table of contents portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment grade securities 
we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies  for acquisitions  for customer financing activities  for working capital needs  and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and dividends 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity  the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables  inventory and supply chain management  deferred revenue  excess tax benefits resulting from share based compensation  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments

risk factors in this report 
accounts receivable  net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable  net in millions  and dso july  july  decrease accounts receivable  net dso our accounts receivable net  as of july  declined by approximately compared with the end of fiscal our dso as of july  was lower by days compared with the end of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our cash collections were strong  and both product and services billings linearity improved  particularly with respect to the timing of product shipments 
services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing dso due in part to the timing of billings which in comparison to product billings  have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter 
as services revenues have increased as a percentage of our total revenue  this has contributed to a higher dso level in comparison to levels we experienced in past years 
we believe that the current dso level is in line with levels we expect in the near future 
inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions  except annualized inventory turns july  july  increase decrease inventories annualized inventory turns purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers inventories as of july  increased by from our balance at the end of fiscal  while for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat 
on a combined basis  inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by from the balance at the end of fiscal we believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts 
the inventory increase was due to higher levels of distributor inventory and higher deferred cost of sales 
our inventories have decreased from the levels we experienced in the first half of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal we announced a restructuring of our consumer business  and as a result we lowered inventory levels for our consumer products 
we also lowered inventory in certain parts of our cable set top business 
our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods 
distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers 
manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build to order and 
table of contents build to stock products 
all inventories are accounted for at the lower of cost or market 
inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market  based upon assumptions about future demand  and are charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of sales 
our ending balance for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers reflects improvement and stabilization in lead times and the mitigation of many of the constraints at our component suppliers that we experienced in fiscal due to the earthquake in japan and resulting industry wide component supply constraints  we made increased commitments to secure our near term supply needs 
offsetting these increases in purchase commitments were actions we have taken related to the restructuring of our consumer business 
while we may experience longer than normal lead times in the future  our lead times to customers improved on nearly all of our products during fiscal and as of the end of fiscal were within a normal range for nearly all of our products 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 
a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
our purchase commitments are for short term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 
we record a liability  included in other current liabilities  for firm  noncancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 
the purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year 
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 
financing receivables and guarantees we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue 
as of july   our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions financing receivables financing guarantees total july  lease receivables loan receivables financed service contracts and other total channel partner end user customers total gross amount less unearned income allowance for credit loss deferred revenue net balance sheet exposure financing receivables gross financing receivables less unearned income have increased by compared with the end of fiscal  driven by a increase in gross financed service contracts  a increase in gross lease receivables  and an increase in gross loan receivables 
we provide financing to certain end user customers 
table of contents and channel partners to enable sales of our products  services  and networking solutions 
these financing arrangements include leases  financed service contracts  and loans 
arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets 
lease receivables include sales type and direct financing leases 
we also provide certain qualified customers financing for long term service contracts  which primarily relate to technical support services 
our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 
we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 
financing guarantees in the normal course of business  third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs 
the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years 
in some cases  we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements 
the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short term financing provided by third parties  generally with payment terms ranging from to days 
in certain instances  these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party 
the receivables are de recognized upon transfer  as these transfers qualify as true sales  and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 
these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners  and in some cases  we guarantee a portion of these arrangements 
we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end user customers 
historically  our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial 
where we provide a guarantee  we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies  or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees 
in either case  the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 
during fiscal  the level of guarantees required by our financing partners decreased  resulting in lower deferred revenue associated with our financing guarantees 
deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts 
the revenue related to financed service contracts  which primarily relates to technical support services  is deferred and included in deferred service revenue 
the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed 
a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria

we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july  in march  we issued billion of senior floating interest rate notes due  billion of fixed rate senior notes due  and million of fixed rate senior notes due  for an aggregate principal amount of billion 
to achieve our interest rate risk management objectives  we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion designated as fair value hedges of the senior fixed rate notes included in the march debt issuance 
in effect  these interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed rate senior notes to floating interest rates based on libor 
the gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes  attributable to market interest rates  in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt 
in addition  in february we repaid billion of fixed rate senior notes upon their maturity 
commercial paper in the third quarter of fiscal we established a short term debt financing program of up to billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes 
as of july   we had commercial paper notes of million outstanding under this program 
other notes and borrowings other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
credit facility we have a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on august  any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to  based on certain conditions  either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank of america s prime rate as announced from time to time or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard poor s ratings services and moody s investors service  inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants  including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
we may also  upon the agreement of either the then existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement  increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional billion and or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to august  as of july   we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants  and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 
deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions july  july  increase service product total reported as current noncurrent total the increase in deferred service revenue reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals  partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue 
the increase in deferred product revenue was 
table of contents primarily related to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of july   partially offset by lower unrecognized revenue from two tier distributors due to the timing of cash receipts from two tier distributors 
contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously 
in addition  we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process

operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments

see further discussion in inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 
as of july   the liability for these purchase commitments was million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  for which we have not received the goods or services 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
long term debt the amount of long term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities include noncurrent income taxes payable  accrued liabilities for deferred compensation  noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  and certain other long term liabilities 
due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments  our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table 
noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by payments 

table of contents other commitments in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases  we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon technology  development  product  or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds  some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones  and some of which are required to be funded on demand 
the funding commitments were million as of july   compared with million as of july  off balance sheet arrangements we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers 
these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities 
we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 
in fiscal  cisco and emc corporation emc  together with vmware  inc vmware formed the virtual computing environment coalition and invested in acadia enterprises llc acadia  a joint venture with emc in which vmware and intel also invested 
during fiscal  the virtual computing environment coalition and acadia were combined into a single entity and renamed the virtual computing environment company vce 
as of july   our cumulative investment in the combined vce entity was approximately million and we owned approximately of the outstanding equity 
we account for our investment in vce under the equity method  and accordingly our carrying value in vce has been reduced by million  which reflects our cumulative share of vce s losses primarily in fiscal over the next months  as vce scales its operations  we expect that we will make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses  in proportion to our ownership percentage 
on an ongoing basis  we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance 
as a result of this ongoing assessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities 
because we may not control these entities  we may not have the ability to influence these events 
we provide financing guarantees  which are generally for various third party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end user customers 
we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end user customers 
see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under financing receivables and guarantees 
securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available for sale investments 
these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities  and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis 
the average balance of securities lending for fiscal and was billion and billion  respectively 
we require collateral equal to at least of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid  high quality assets 
we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties  and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against any collateral losses 
as of july  and july   we had no 
table of contents outstanding securities lending transactions 
we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 
we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented 
stock repurchase program and dividends in september  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program 
as of july   our board of directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to billion of common stock under this program  and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was billion with no termination date 
the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program  reported based on the trade date is summarized as follows in millions  except per share amounts shares repurchased weighted average price per share amount repurchased cumulative balance at july  repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program cumulative balance at july  repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program cumulative balance at july  during fiscal  cash dividends of per share  or million  were declared on our outstanding common stock and paid during the same period 
any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 
liquidity and capital resource requirements based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments  cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy  through at least the next months  our liquidity requirements  both in total and domestically  including the following working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  cash dividends  contractual obligations  commitments  principal and interest payments on debt  future customer financings  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations 
there are no other transactions  arrangements  or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of  as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks  including interest rate risk  equity price risk  and foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate risk fixed income securities we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
at any time  a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates  including the impact from lower credit spreads  could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio 
we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives 
we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading 
our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
as of july   approximately of our fixed income securities balance consists of us government and us government agency securities 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 
the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities  including the hedging effects when applicable  as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates 
the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  plus bps  and plus bps 
due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal and fiscal  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus bps or minus bps was relevant 
the hypothetical fair values as of july  and july  are as follows in millions valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps fixed income securities n a n a    valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps fixed income securities n a n a    there were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities for fiscal or for fiscal we had impairment charges of million on investments in fixed income securities 
debt as of july   we had billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding  which consisted of billion floating rate notes and billion fixed rate notes 
the carrying amount of the senior notes was billion  and the related fair value was billion  which fair value is based on market prices 
as of july   a hypothetical bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt  excluding the billion of hedged debt  by a decrease or increase of billion  respectively 
however  this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt  which is not hedged 

table of contents equity price risk the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility 
we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio 
our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard poor s index or nasdaq composite index 
these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 
to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities  we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
publicly traded equity securities the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio  excluding hedged equity securities  if any 
potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus   and were selected based on potential near term changes in those security prices

investments in privately held companies we have also invested in privately held companies 
these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method 
as of july   the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was million  compared with million at july  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in  including  among other factors  the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 
our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our foreign exchange forward and option contracts are summarized as follows in millions july  july  notional amount fair value notional amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold option contracts purchased sold we conduct business globally in numerous currencies 
the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non us customers and thereby reduces demand 
a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect
