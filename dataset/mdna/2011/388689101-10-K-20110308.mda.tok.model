the following will be discussed and analyzed overview of business overview of results results of operations financial condition  liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies new accounting standards business outlook overview of business the company s objective is to strengthen its position as a leading provider of packaging solutions 
to achieve this objective  the company offers customers its paperboard  cartons and packaging machines  either as an integrated solution or separately 
cartons and carriers are designed to protect and contain products 
product offerings include a variety of laminated  coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from the company s cuk  crb and urb  as well as other grades of paperboard that are purchased from third party suppliers 
innovative designs and combinations of paperboard  films  foils  metallization  holographics and embossing are customized to the individual needs of the customers 
the company is a leading supplier of flexible packaging in north america 
products include multi wall bags  shingle wrap  plastic bags and film for building materials such as ready mix concrete  retort pouches such as meals ready to go  medical test kits  batch inclusion bags and film 
key end markets include food and agriculture  building and industrial materials  chemicals  minerals  pet foods  and pharmaceutical products 
the company s label business focuses on two product lines heat transfer labels and lithographic labels 
the company is implementing strategies i to expand market share in its current markets and to identify and penetrate new markets  ii to capitalize on the company s customer relationships  business competencies  and mills and converting assets  iii to develop and market innovative  sustainable products and applications  and iv to continue to reduce costs by focusing on operational improvements 
the company s ability to fully implement its strategies and achieve its objective may be influenced by a variety of factors  many of which are beyond its control  such as inflation of raw material and other costs  which the company cannot always pass through to its customers  and the effect of overcapacity in the worldwide paperboard packaging industry 
significant factors that impact the company s business impact of inflation 
the company s cost of sales consists primarily of energy including natural gas  fuel oil and electricity  pine pulpwood  chemicals  recycled fibers  purchased paperboard  paper  aluminum foil  ink  plastic films and resins  depreciation expense and labor 
inflation increased year over year costs by million in and by million in  while deflation decreased year over year costs by million in the higher costs in are primarily related to secondary fiber and wood million  resin million  externally purchased board million  ink and coatings million  other costs million  freight million  and labor and related benefits million 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower energy costs million  mainly due to the price of natural gas  and other chemical based inputs million 

table of contents as the price of natural gas has experienced significant variability  the company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows caused by changes in the price of natural gas 
the company has entered into natural gas swap contracts to hedge prices for a portion of its expected usage for since negotiated sales contracts and the market largely determine the pricing for its products  the company is at times limited in its ability to raise prices and pass through to its customers any inflationary or other cost increases that the company may incur 
substantial debt obligations 
the company has  million of outstanding debt obligations as of december  this debt can have significant consequences for the company  as it requires a significant portion of cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of principal and interest  exposes the company to the risk of increased interest rates and restricts the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
covenants in the company s credit agreement and indentures also prohibit or restrict  among other things  the disposal of assets  the incurrence of additional indebtedness including guarantees  payment of dividends  loans or advances and certain other types of transactions 
these restrictions could limit the company s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures 
the credit agreement also requires compliance with a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio 
the company s ability to comply in future periods with the financial covenant will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to many other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
see covenant restrictions in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding the company s debt obligations 
the substantial debt and the restrictions under the credit agreement and the indentures could limit the company s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures 
the material outstanding debt obligations and the restrictions may also leave the company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business  or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs 
commitment to cost reduction 
in light of increasing margin pressure throughout the packaging industry  the company has programs in place that are designed to reduce costs  improve productivity and increase profitability 
the company utilizes a global continuous improvement initiative that uses statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities  including production and maintenance 
this includes a six sigma process focused on reducing variable and fixed manufacturing and administrative costs 
the company expanded the continuous improvement initiative to include the deployment of lean sigma principles into manufacturing and supply chain services 
as the company strengthens the systems approach to continuous improvement  lean sigma supports the efforts to build a high performing culture 
during  the company achieved million in cost savings as compared to  through its continuous improvement programs and manufacturing initiatives 
the company s ability to continue to successfully implement its business strategies and to realize anticipated savings and operating efficiencies is subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control 
if the company cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions or other cost savings plans it may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers 
in addition  any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the company s financial results 
competition and market factors 
as some products can be packaged in different types of materials  the company s sales are affected by competition from other manufacturers cuk board and other substrates such as sbs and ccn 
substitute products also include plastic  shrink film and corrugated containers 
in addition  while the company has long term relationships with many of its customers  the underlying contracts may be re bid or renegotiated from time to time  and the company may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all 
the company works to maintain market share through efficiency  product innovation and strategic sourcing to its customers  however  pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship 
in addition  the company s sales historically are driven by consumer buying habits in the markets its customers serve 
increases in the costs of living  the poor condition of the residential real estate market  high 
table of contents unemployment rates  reduced access to credit markets  as well as other macroeconomic factors  may significantly negatively affect consumer spending behavior  which could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products 
new product introductions and promotional activity by the company s customers and the company s introduction of new packaging products also impact its sales 
the company s containerboard business is subject to conditions in the cyclical worldwide commodity paperboard markets  which have a significant impact on containerboard sales 
alternative fuel tax credit 
the company burns alternative fuel at its west monroe  la and macon  ga mills in order to produce energy and recover chemicals 
during  the us internal revenue code allowed an excise tax credit under certain circumstances for the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel mixtures 
in the first quarter  the company filed an application with the internal revenue service the irs for certification of eligibility to receive the tax credit for its use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures in the recovery boilers at the mills 
during the second quarter  the company received notification from the irs that its registration as an alternate fuel mixer had been approved

the excise tax credit expired on december  overview of results this management s discussion and analysis contains an analysis of net sales  income from operations and other information relevant to an understanding of results of operations 
to enhance the understanding of continuing operations  this discussion and analysis excludes discontinued operations for all periods presented 
net sales in decreased by million to  million from  million in due primarily to the impact of divested businesses in the flexible packaging segment and lower pricing and volume in the paperboard packaging segment 
these decreases were partially offset by higher pricing in flexible packaging and favorable foreign exchange rates  primarily in japan  australia and canada 
income from operations in decreased by million  or  to million from million in this decrease was due primarily to the million alternative fuel tax credit net of expenses received in and higher input costs experienced in the negative impact of the inflation was offset by cost savings achieved through continuous improvement programs and manufacturing initiatives and lower merger related expenses of million
