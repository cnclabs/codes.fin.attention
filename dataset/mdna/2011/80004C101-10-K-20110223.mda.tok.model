table of contents general we are the inventor and leading supplier of nand flash data storage products 
our goal is to provide simple  reliable  and affordable storage solutions for consumer use in a wide variety of formats and devices 
we sell our products globally to retail and oem customers 
we design  develop and manufacture data storage solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  proprietary controller and firmware technologies 
we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash memory supply requirements through our significant flash venture relationships with toshiba  which produce and provide us with leading edge  low cost memory wafers 
our removable card products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones  digital cameras  gaming devices and laptop computers 
our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones  tablets  ereaders  gps devices  gaming systems  imaging devices and computing platforms 
for computing platforms  we provide high speed  high capacity storage solutions known as ssds that can be used in lieu of hard disk drives 
our strategy is to be an industry leading supplier of nand flash storage solutions and to develop large scale markets for nand based storage products 
we maintain our technology leadership by investing in advanced technologies and nand flash memory fabrication capacity in order to produce leading edge  low cost nand memory for use in a variety of end products  including consumer  mobile phone and computing devices 
we are a one stop shop for our retail and oem customers  selling in high volumes all major nand flash storage card formats for our target markets 
our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices  which in turn primarily depends on end user demand for consumer electronic products 
we believe the markets for flash storage are generally price elastic  meaning that a decrease in the price per gigabyte results in increased demand for higher capacities and the emergence of new applications for flash storage 
accordingly  we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices  consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time  new markets will emerge 
in order to profitably capitalize on this price elasticity  we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte  while at the same time  increasing the average capacity and or the number of units of our products enough to offset price declines 
we continually seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements  primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon 
our industry is characterized by rapid technology transitions 
since our inception  we have been able to scale nand technology through fourteen generations over approximately twenty years 
however  the pace at which nand technology is transitioning to new generations is expected to slow due to inherent physical technology limitations 
we currently expect to be able to continue to scale our nand technology through a few additional generations  but beyond that there is no certainty that further technology scaling can be achieved cost effectively with the current nand flash technology and architecture 
we also continue to invest in future alternative technologies  including our d read write technology  which we believe may be a viable alternative to nand when nand can no longer scale at a sufficient rate  or at all 
however  even when nand flash can no longer be further scaled  we expect nand and potential alternative technologies to coexist for an extended period of time 

table of contents fiscal year developments and transactions in march  we completed the redemption of our convertible notes due through an all cash transaction of million plus accrued interest of million 
in july  we and toshiba entered into an agreement to create flash forward to operate in fab  of which we will own and toshiba will own 
toshiba will own and fund the construction of the fab building  which will be located in yokkaichi  japan  adjacent to the site of our current flash partners and flash alliance ventures 
fab is designed to be built in two phases 
the phase building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year  after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin  with initial nand production scheduled for the third quarter of our fiscal year we are committed to invest in of the initial ramp within phase of fab  which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal year no timelines have been finalized for phase capacity expansions beyond or for the construction of phase for phase expansion beyond the initial ramp  we have the option to make investments and share output on a basis between us and toshiba 
if and when phase is built  we are committed to of an initial ramp in phase  similar to that in phase on completion of the second phase  fab is expected to be of similar size and capacity to fab we and toshiba will each retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of each party s respective fab capacity ramps  and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportionate level of equipment funding 
in august  we issued and sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due august   or the notes due the notes due were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of per annum 
the notes due may be converted into our common stock  under certain circumstances  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
the net proceeds to us from the offering of the notes were million 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes due  we purchased a convertible bond hedge for million and sold warrants for million 
the separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes due we currently intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  including the repayment at maturity or repurchase  from time to time  of a portion of our outstanding convertible senior notes due  which mature on may   capital expenditures for new and existing manufacturing facilities  development of new technologies  general working capital  and other non manufacturing capital expenditures 
the net proceeds may also be used to fund strategic investments or acquisitions of products  technologies or complementary businesses or to obtain the right or license to use additional technologies 
on january   sanjay mehrotra  cofounder and most recently our president and chief operating officer  became our president and chief executive officer  following the december  retirement of our founder dr 
eli harari  who had been our chairman and chief executive officer 
the board appointed mr 
mehrotra to serve as a director of the company effective july  michael marks  a member of our board since  assumed the role of chairman on january  fiscal years and included weeks as compared to weeks in fiscal year 
table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies  share based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  there is transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at january  and january   deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in calculating the value of sales incentive programs  actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers 
the timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues 
in addition  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on hand and on noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

table of contents deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
from time to time  we must evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and determine whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also consider the jurisdictional mix of income and loss  changes in tax regulations in the period the changes are enacted and the type of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released  we use judgment in considering the cumulative effect of negative and positive evidence and the weight given to the potential effect of the evidence 
recent historical income or loss and future projected operational results have the most influence on our determinations of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is required or not 
our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence  complexity of the matter  available federal tax case law  interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates 
there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and equity method investments 
we perform tests for impairment of long lived and intangible assets and equity method investments whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment of long lived and intangible assets are only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
an impairment of an equity method investment is deemed to occur if the fair value  based upon quoted market prices if available or forecasted discounted cash flows  is less than the carrying value 
substantially all of our equity method investments are not actively traded and we rely on discounted cash flows to estimate fair value 
these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
fair value of investments in debt instruments 
there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  investments and fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level securities represent quoted prices in active markets  and therefore do not require significant management judgment 
our level securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  and other similar data  which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices  or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information  compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information 
in the current market environment  the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 
however  given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets  we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions was material to the valuation of our cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities 
we currently do not have any investments that use level inputs

table of contents license and royalty revenues 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages license and royalty revenues the decrease in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues when compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a lower effective royalty rate in a renewed license agreement with one of our significant licensees as compared to the previous license agreement 
the decrease in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues when compared to fiscal year was due to lower flash memory revenues reported by our licensees and a new license agreement with an existing licensee at a lower effective royalty rate as compared to the previous license agreement

fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages product gross profit loss product gross margins as a percent of product revenue total gross margins as a percent of total revenue product gross margins in fiscal year increased compared to fiscal year due primarily to cost reductions exceeding average selling price reductions 
the decrease in product cost is primarily due to wafer production transitioning from nanometer to nanometer technology  increased usage of x technology  and production at flash partners and flash alliance running at full utilization in fiscal year compared to less than full utilization in the first half of fiscal year while cost reductions exceeded average selling price reductions in fiscal year  the rate of cost decline of our memory products was less in fiscal year than fiscal year in part due to the appreciation of the japanese yen  which resulted in an increase in our foreign denominated costs 
furthermore  the increase in product gross margin was partially offset by an million charge related to a power outage experienced at fab and fab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year product gross margins in fiscal year increased percentage points compared to fiscal year due to manufacturing costs declining faster than prices and a net benefit of million  primarily from the sale of inventory which had been previously partially reserved in fiscal year to reflect the market value of certain inventory which was determined to be below cost 
the increase in product gross margin in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was also due to charges in for the impairment of our investments in flash ventures of million and for adverse purchase commitments of million associated with under utilization of flash ventures capacity 
the rate of decline in average selling price per gigabyte slowed in fiscal year due to an improved balance between supply and demand  impacted in part by our actions in early fiscal year to sell a portion of our manufacturing capacity in flash ventures to toshiba  and hold the remaining wafer output capacity constant 
the rate of cost decline of our memory products was similar in fiscal years and

other income expense  net in fiscal year included a gain of million related to the sale of the net assets of our mobile phone sim card business and the sale of certain public equity securities 
other income expense  net was a net expense for fiscal year due to bank charges and fees of million related to the restructuring of the flash ventures master equipment leases and impairment of our equity investment in flashvision of million 
our fiscal year total other income expense  net decreased compared to fiscal year primarily due to lower foreign currency gains and transaction costs incurred in fiscal year related to the sale of equipment and transfer of lease obligations resulting from the restructuring of flash ventures  reflected in other income expense  net

provision for income taxes 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages provision for income taxes effective income tax rates our fiscal year provision for income taxes was primarily related to income taxes on our us and foreign operations  partially offset by the release of valuation allowances that were previously recorded against our us federal and state deferred tax assets and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to specific tax jurisdictions 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes was primarily related to withholding taxes on license and royalty income from certain foreign licensees and income tax provisions recorded by foreign subsidiaries while income taxes for us federal and state were substantially offset by the reduction of valuation allowance related to the utilization of tax credits 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain us and foreign gross deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation allowance was due primarily to the size of the fiscal year net loss and that it was not more likely than not that certain us and foreign deferred tax assets would be realized in the future 
in october  the irs commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through we do not expect a resolution to be reached during the next twelve months 
in addition  we are currently under audit by various state and international tax authorities

we also use these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  and not as a replacement for  results presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures  including net income loss and non gaap net income loss per diluted share  provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports 
we have historically used these non gaap measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past  present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations 
externally  we believe that these non gaap measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of our company 
internally  these non gaap measures are significant measures used by us for evaluating the core operating performance of the company  establishing internal budgets  setting and determining variable compensation levels  calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives  comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models  strategic planning  and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors 

table of contents we exclude the following items from our non gaap measures share based compensation expense 
these expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options  employee restricted stock units  modifications of employee stock options and restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan 
although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results 
further  we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of our peer companies 
impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 
this item reflects the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets to their fair values 
because of the infrequent nature of this charge  management does not include this type of item in internal operating forecasts and models 
excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare our core operating results in different periods without this variability 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
we incur amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions 
since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle  we exclude these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods 
convertible debt interest 
this is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt 
the value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
we exclude this non cash interest expense as it does not represent the semi annual cash interest payments made to our note holders 
income tax adjustments 
this amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis  considering jurisdictional tax rates  consistent with the presentation of non gaap net income 
it also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record  considering jurisdictional tax rates  if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
from time to time in the future  there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management 
limitations of relying on non gaap financial measures 
we have incurred and will incur in the future  many of the costs excluded from the non gaap measures  including share based compensation expense  impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs  non cash economic interest expense related to our convertible debt and income tax adjustments 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
these non gaap measures may be different than the non gaap measures used by other companies

cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from higher net income of billion compared with net income of million in the prior year 
cash flow from accounts receivable decreased  as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year compared with the prior year  due to increased revenue in fiscal year cash flow from inventory increased primarily due to a reduction in inventory from increased product sales 
cash flow from other assets decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in tax related receivables in fiscal year and a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties increased primarily due to the timing of flash ventures payments as compared to the prior year  resulting in an increase in cash provided 
cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year increased as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased accrued payroll and related expenses 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from our net income of million compared with a net loss of billion  which included non cash impairment charges  in the comparable period of the prior year 
cash flow from accounts receivable decreased  as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year compared with the prior year  due to increased revenue in fiscal year cash used for inventory decreased primarily due to higher sales 
cash flow from other assets increased compared with the prior year primarily due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year related to carryback claims from the fiscal year net loss 
accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties decreased primarily due to the reduction of gross inventory  operating expenses and the timing of flash ventures payments as compared to the prior year  resulting in a decrease in cash provided 
cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of settlements in hedge contracts and the elimination of liabilities for flash ventures adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of flash ventures capacity 

table of contents investing activities 
the higher usage of cash in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily related to a net increase in short and long term marketable securities and an increase in property and equipment purchases 
during fiscal year  we had negligible net loan issuances to flash ventures compared to a net loan repayment from flash ventures of million in fiscal year in addition  in fiscal year  we received proceeds of million related to the sale of the net assets of our mobile phone sim card business 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily related to lower proceeds from sale and maturities of short and long term marketable securities  offset by a reduction in the net loans made to flash ventures and a reduced investment in property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we loaned million to flash ventures for equipment purchases and received million on the collection of outstanding notes receivable from flash ventures for the sale of a portion of our production capacity and the return of excess cash from flash partners 
this resulted in a net loan repayment from flash ventures of million in fiscal year compared to a loan of million to flash ventures for equipment purchases in fiscal year financing activities 
the fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our notes due  related warrants and convertible bond hedge in august of million  higher cash received from employee stock programs and the excess tax benefit from share based compensation  offset by the redemption of our convertible notes due of million in the first quarter of fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million was higher than fiscal year primarily due to the repayment of debt financing in fiscal year of million 
liquid assets 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of billion 
we have billion of long term marketable securities which we believe are also liquid assets  but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of each marketable security being greater than one year 
short term liquidity 
as of january   our working capital balance was billion 
during fiscal year  we expect our portion of capital investments in flash ventures plus our investment in non fab property  plant and equipment to be between billion and billion  of which we expect approximately million to million will be funded through our cash  including by providing loans and investments to the flash ventures 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business 
we may also make equity investments in other companies  engage in merger or acquisition transactions  or purchase or license technologies 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts  could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business  responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding flash ventures master lease agreements 
the flash ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor  including  among other things  our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least billion  and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of bb from s p or moody s  or a minimum corporate rating of bb from r i 
as of january   flash ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants 
as of january   our r i credit rating was bbb  three notches above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from r i and our s p credit rating was bb  which is the required minimum corporate rating threshold from s p 
if both s p and r i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold  flash ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements 
such resolution could include  among other things  supplementary security to be supplied by us  as guarantor  or increased interest rates or waiver fees  should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances 
if a resolution was unsuccessful  we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire outstanding lease obligations which are denominated in japanese yen and valued at approximately million covered by our guarantee under such flash ventures master lease agreements  based upon the exchange rate at january   which would negatively impact our short term liquidity 

table of contents long term requirements 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business 
we may also make equity investments in other companies  engage in merger or acquisition transactions  or purchase or license technologies 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts  could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business  responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
financing arrangements 
at january   we had billion aggregate principal amount of notes due outstanding and billion aggregate principal amount of notes due outstanding 
see note  financing arrangements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in part ii  item of this report 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as of january   the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire in august at expiration  we may  at our option  elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis 
as of january   the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding 
in addition  concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we entered into a convertible bond hedge transaction in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due in full  at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes due or the first day that none of the notes due remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the notes due as of january   we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share

table of contents ventures with toshiba 
we are a owner in both flash partners and flash alliance  our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products 
in july  we and toshiba entered into an agreement to create flash forward to operate in fab  of which we will own and toshiba will own 
toshiba will own and fund the construction of the fab building  which will be located in yokkaichi  japan  adjacent to the site of our current flash partners and flash alliance ventures 
fab is designed to be built in two phases 
the phase building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year  after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin  with initial nand production scheduled for the third quarter of our fiscal year we are committed to invest in of the initial ramp within phase of fab  which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal year no timelines have been finalized for phase capacity expansions beyond or for the construction of phase for phase expansion beyond the initial ramp  we have the option to make investments and share output on a basis between us and toshiba 
if and when phase is built  we are committed to of an initial ramp in phase  similar to that in phase on completion of the second phase  fab is expected to be of similar size and capacity to fab we and toshiba will each retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of each party s respective fab capacity ramps  and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportionate level of equipment funding 
see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in part ii  item of this report for our contractual obligations related to flash forward 
with these ventures  we and toshiba collaborate in the development and manufacture of nand flash memory products 
these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by these ventures 
this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba 
these ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of these ventures nand wafer supply or pay for of the fixed costs of these ventures 
we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers 
see note  related parties and strategic investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in part ii  item of this report 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from these ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues 
these ventures are variable interest entities  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we do not have a controlling financial interest in each venture 
accordingly  we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
under flash ventures agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our requirement to fund common research and development activities ended and final funding was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year as of january  and january   we had no accrued liabilities related to these expenses 
we continue to participate in other common research and development activities with toshiba but are not committed to any minimum funding level 

table of contents for semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flash ventures  we and or toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis  of the outstanding flash ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from december through april these master lease obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable 
our total master lease obligation guarantee as of january  was billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january  on january   flash partners refinanced two of its maturing equipment leases totaling billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january  we and toshiba have each guaranteed  on a several basis  of flash partners obligations under the refinanced lease agreement 
this refinanced equipment lease  due in fiscal year  is to be paid by flash partners in quarterly installments  with interest based on the month euro yen tokyo interbank offer rate tibor 
in our fiscal year  we and toshiba restructured flash partners and flash alliance by selling more than of the capacity of each of the two ventures to toshiba 
the restructuring resulted in us receiving value of billion japanese yen of which billion japanese yen  or million  was received in cash  reducing outstanding notes receivable from flash ventures and billion japanese yen of value reflected the transfer of off balance sheet equipment lease guarantee obligations from us to toshiba 
the restructuring was completed in a series of closings beginning in january and extending through march  in the first quarter of fiscal year  transaction costs of million related to the sale and transfer of equipment and lease obligations were expensed 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment for the ventures in order to convert to new process technologies or add wafer capacity 
flash partners has previously reached full wafer capacity 
flash alliance is expected to reach full wafer capacity in contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at january   and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in part ii  item of this report 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers 
in addition  we also have significant costs denominated in the chinese renminbi and the israeli new shekel  and we have revenue denominated in the european euro and the british pound 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future japanese yen costs for nand flash wafers 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income expense or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci  and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized 
these foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve  and they could harm our financial results and cash flows 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in part ii  item of this report 
for a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks  see part i  item a  risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investment grade marketable securities 
as of january   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar  with some revenues transacted in the european euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen 
our flash memory costs  which represent the largest portion of our cost of revenues  are denominated in the japanese yen 
we also have some cost of revenues denominated in chinese renminbi 
the majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the us dollar  however  we have expenses denominated in the israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies 
on the balance sheet  we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  with the largest monetary exposure being our notes receivable from flash ventures  which are denominated in japanese yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the fair value of these contracts is reflected as other assets or other liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially hedge our future japanese yen flash memory costs 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated oci and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized 
at january   we had foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in us dollar equivalent of approximately million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position 
the maturities of these contracts were months or less 
at january   we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts in place that amounted to a net purchase in us dollar equivalent of approximately million in foreign currencies to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in japanese yen 
the maturities of these contracts were months or less 

table of contents the notional amount and unrealized gain or loss of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated balance sheet hedges as of january  is shown in the table below 
in addition  this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
these changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
notional amount unrealized gain loss as of january  change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in thousands balance sheet hedges cross currency swap contracts entered forward contracts sold forward contracts purchased total net outstanding contracts the notional amount and fair value of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of january  is shown in the table below 
in addition  this table shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
notional amount fair value as of january  change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in thousands cash flow hedges forward contracts purchased notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks  we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures  and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we do hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
market risk 
we hold available for sale equity securities  a portion of which is hedged  in publicly traded companies 
as of january   a reduction in price of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially
