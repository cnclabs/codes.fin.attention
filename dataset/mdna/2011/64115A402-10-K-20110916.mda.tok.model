there are various attributes which determine the level of complexity  a few of which are number of contracts  size of the portfolio  business strategy of the customer  number of business users  and branch network of the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non cancelable  non contingent license agreement has been signed  delivery of the software has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
however  revenue from sale of licenses with major customization  modification  and development is recognized on a percent of completion basis 
implementation related services  including gap analysis  configuration  data migration  user acceptance testing uat and training are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method 
maintenance and support related services are then provided on a continued basis 
revenue from software services includes fixed price contracts and is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method using the output measure of unit of work completed 
the annual maintenance fee  which usually is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the implementation  then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on yearly basis

marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels 
the corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications  advertising  public relations and the website and  also engineers and oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units 
our dedicated marketing personnel  within the regions  undertake a variety of marketing activities  including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products  sponsoring and participating in targeted conferences and holding private briefings with individual companies

the markets netsol provides its services primarily to clients in global commercial industries 
in the global commercial area  the company service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including  automotive  chemical  textiles  internet marketing  software  medical  banks  higher education and telecommunication associations  and  financial services 
geographically  netsol has operations on the west coast of the united states  central asia  europe  and the asia pacific region 
netsol took the initiative as the first us nasdaq listed company to dual list on the nasdaq dubai exchange in dubai 
although uae markets suffered the impact of recession  this move was primarily to introduce netsol to the potential of the most capitalized middle eastern countries 
by design  netsol has increased its brand recognition in one of the most vibrant and dynamically growing regions 
netsol researched and identified brazil as one of the fastest emerging economies in bric nations 
the growth rate in excess of annually and a growing middle class offers tremendous new markets for netsol business offerings in the auto manufacturing  financial services  banks  energy and oil sectors 
most of the major global auto manufacturers  such as vw  fiat  nissan  mercedez benz and toyota hold a majority of the market share 
in terms of the energy and oil sectors  petrobras is the biggest oil giant in brazil and has one of the world s most ambitious business plans for growth 
netsol intends to focus on these sectors for nfs and customized it solutions and services 
management believes that the newly formed joint venture with the well reputed and established brasilinvest group will provide introduction to these companies to promote netsol offerings 
the asian continent including  australia and new zealand  from the perspective of marketing  are targeted by the asia pacific region from its bangkok  beijing and lahore facilities 
the marketing for our products and services in the americas and europe is carried out from our san francisco bay area and london metropolitan area offices 
people and culture the company believes it has developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to its success 
its key values are delivering world class quality software  client focused timely delivery  leadership  long term relationships  creativity  openness and transparency and professional growth 
the services provided by netsol require proficiency in many fields  such as software engineering  project management  business analysis  technical writing  sales and marketing  communication and presentation skills 
to encourage all employees to build on our core values  we reward teamwork and promote individuals who demonstrate these values 
netsol offers all of its employees the opportunity to participate in its stock option program 
also  the company has an intensive orientation program for new employees to introduce our core values and a number of internal communications and training initiatives defining and promoting these core values 
we believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based 
netsol worldwide is an equal opportunity employer 
netsol believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible 
certain of our subsidiaries are located in regions where basic services are not readily available 
where possible  netsol acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees but the standard of living in these regions 
an example of such programs are humanitarian relief we are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters 
netsol has historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest 
as recently as last year  the company established a fund raising effort on a worldwide basis to encourage outside and employee contributions to relief efforts 
literacy program launched to educate low paid illiterate employees of the organization 
the main objective of this program is to enable these resources to acquire basic reading  writing and arithmetic skills 
the first phase of the plan was completed with astounding accomplishments  the people who could not even write a single word are now able to write complete letters within a span of months 
this initiative has been extremely successful and netsol intends to further support this program 
noble cause fund a noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of the low paid employees 
netsol employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and the company matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent amount contribution 
a portion of this fund is utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals  outside netsol 
day care facility netsol s human resources are its key assets and thus the company takes numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to its employees 
in pakistan  the provision of outside pre school child care is a rarity 
recently  a child day care facility has been created in close proximity to the work premises equipped with the necessary essential staff and equipment 
married female employees are offered the opportunity to entrust complete care of their young ones to a trained and experienced staff 
child day care allows female employees to pay unhindered focused attention to work requirements while their child remains safe and comfortable 
the premises and environment are neat and clean with all basic needs fulfilled to ensure complete care of the children 
preventative health care program in addition to the comprehensive out patient and in patient medical benefits  preventive health care has also been introduced 
this phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against hepatitis a b  tetanus  typhoid and flu  etc 
this is a regular annual immunization program to keep employees healthy 
netsol corporate university netsol corporate university ncu was established for developing human resources at netsol 
a need was felt to further develop and retain the talent at hand through strategic learning interventions to respond to growing competition and challenges 
overall  netsol as a global it company has over female employees with the biggest concentration in our development facility in lahore and in the us headquarters 
the company is an equal opportunity employer 
being a successful company with a well respected name in the business community  netsol encourages its employees to actively participate and contribute to charitable contributions for catastrophic tragedies anywhere in the globe 
there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer 
the company runs an elaborate training program for different cadre of employees ranging from technical knowledge  business domains as well as communication  management and leadership skills 
the company believes that it has been successful in its efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available  in part because of the emphasis on core values  training and professional growth 
we intend to continue to recruit  hire and promote employees who share this vision 
as of june   we had full time employees and part time employees  comprised of it project and technical personnel  and non it personnel 
the non it personnel include employees in management  employees in sales and marketing  employees in accounting  in customer support  and in general and administration 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
competition neither a single company  nor a small number of companies  dominates the it market in the space in which the company competes 
a substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by netsol 
some of these are large industrial firms  including computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than netsol and  in some cases  may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by netsol 
in the nfs business space  the barriers to entry are getting higher 
the products are getting more cutting edge while richness in functionality is paramount 
older companies have prolonged the life of their legacy products by creating web based front ends  while the core of the systems has not been re engineered 
in the case of nfs  we compete chiefly against leading suppliers of it solutions to the financial industry  including names such as fimasys  international decision systems ids  data scan  chp consulting  i infotech  finnone and nucleus software 
in the it based business services areas  we compete with both smaller local firms and many global it services providers  including names such as wipro  infosys  satyam infoway  hcl and tcs tata consulting 
our competition is based primarily in high cost locations in the us  uk and europe as opposed to netsol with its facility in bangkok and lahore 
netsol is now the only company in the leasing and finance solution space that provides regional solutions in north america  europe and asia pacific 
in addition  it is the only company in this space that is publicly listed and provides an offshore development infrastructure with cmmi level accreditation 
some of the competitors of the company are international decisions systems  edw  data scan  aipac  chp  kpmg  lmk resources  systems innovation si  bearing point  kalsoft  systems limited  oratech pakistan  techaccess pakistan a few others 
these companies are scattered worldwide geographically 
in terms of offshore development  we are in competition with some of the indian companies such as wipro  hcl  tcs  infosys  satyam infoway and others 
many of the competitors of netsol have longer operating history  larger client bases  and longer relationships with clients  greater brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  and public relations resources than netsol 
existing or future competitors may develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customers some of the customers of netsol include mercedes benz financial services australia  japan  new zealand  singapore  south korea  thailand  china  india and taiwan  investec asset finance  bnp paribas lease group  aldermore bank  singers healthcare finance  scania finance  capital one bank  yamaha motors finance australia  toyota motors finance china  toyota leasing thailand  finlease commercial bank mauritius  cnh capital australia  fiat automotive finance china  dongfeng nissan auto finance china  bmw financial services china  bmw japan  al amthal leasing saudi arabia  gmac china  sany corporation china  gac sofinco  china  nissan australia  byd china  kiatnakin bank thailand and minsheng financial leasing china

however  management outlook for the continuing operations  which has been consolidated and has been streamlined  remains optimistic 
marketing and business development activities management has developed  and the board of directors has ratified  an aggressive year growth strategy aimed at increasing competitiveness and financial strength 
this plan is designed to achieve annual revenue growth for next years result in enhanced organic growth foster strategic and synergestic m a and alliances enhance delivery capabilities in usa and thailand locations the plan contemplates the following enhanced activities and initiatives will accomplish these goals o the remarkable success and demand of nfs in china has led to long term planning to expand in the chinese market 
the overall steady economic growth in china and historic transformation of the auto sector china outsold cars against the united states in number of units in combined with growing consumer spending  warrants hiring additional local chinese staff and infrastructure improvement 
management is poised to create a proximity development center or pdc and clients support team to better serve our growing customers base 
the chinese market offers huge opportunities in the auto sectors in comparison with the us market  thus offers a very strong growth opportunities for nfs 
o netsol s beijing office more than doubled its office space on march   new local chinese staff has been added and additional hiring continues 
the process of forming a new wholly owned subsidiary by the company  as a wholly owned foreign enterprise under chinese laws  is in progress and is expected to be completed in the current calendar year 
netsol is positioning china to become a dominant market for lending enterprise solutions for captive multinationals and local chinese companies  including equipment finance  big ticket leasing markets and the banking industry 
in the lease and finance domain netsol can claim the de facto leadership position in the rapidly growing chinese market 
o thailand has emerged as a new market for banking and auto finance 
netsol has formalized its presence in bangkok by establishing a wholly owned subsidiary  netsol thai 
the office space in bangkok has been enhanced with new hires of local and international staff to address and support a very rapidly growing market 
the pipeline of new customers is growing from the markets in japan  south korea  australia  india and other regional markets 
these markets will be serviced and supported from the thailand office with strong sales and client support team 
the bangkok facility is intended to become the prime location for delivery and implementation for global customers and partners particularly in asia pacific 
o to date  few us based fortune captive auto finance companies have shown serious interest in nfs 
we expect  however  to achieve stronger results through strengthening netsol s north american operation by augmenting the service levels of the local technical team with effective integration of the netsol pk center of excellence  resulting in a seamless integration of core project delivery and global support teams 
the consolidation period of is over and we expect this mature and giant industry to add new capital investment 
netsol is experiencing a growing interest in our next generation nfs solution which is poised to go to market by late to expand our revenue base 
o the new and fast growing manifestations of ecommerce  such as cloud computing  are being utilized by some of our offerings and will be further explored by us for other offerings 
our new ip  aka  smartoci has been demonstrated and presented to major fortune companies in the us as an on demand  catalogue content management system 
the demand of e procurement search engine seems robust and attractive 
several new license sales activities are in the pipeline and we are analyzing the possibilities of spinning them out as a stand alone ecommerce new vertical for netsol 
o europe recently experienced a severe recession 
despite this  netsol europe s operations have been steady 
further  the business outlook is positive and  if this continues  nte is expected to expand its product line and hire stronger management personnel 
our relationship with existing clientele is very strong and we are cautiously expanding the sales and marketing efforts in the region 
o the market of the kingdom of saudi arabia is robust  rich and well capitalized  offering vast opportunities for netsol through our joint venture 
recently  there have been a few new local it contracts awarded but our vision is based on long term and high value projects in the defense  public  infrastructure and multinational auto captive markets 
in order to be equal partners with a major conglomerate  atheeb group  a billion group in revenue  we need to have the serious financial wherewithal and resources to bid on major projects exceeding million each in value 
currently  the joint venture has employees based in riyadh with direct delivery and implementation support from netsol pk 
the long term plan is to expand staffing levels and provide financial capability to bid in major projects with atheeb 
o our nfs suite of products is currently undergoing a major initiative towards developing the next generation of solutions 
the company believes that this would change the landscape for netsol and increase both demand and the market 
we are in the middle of developing a comprehensive sales and marketing plan requiring new personnel  markets and investment 
o in order to maximize the market and product potential of our sap and ecommerce line  highlighted by our smartoci product  we are spinning this line off into its own operational entity 
we believe this will better enhance product and market development by providing a dedicated management and fulfillment staff 
growth new alliances  mergers acquisition o pursue new opportunities in emerging markets of latin america such as brazil and argentina through local partners 
these focused and niche markets for leasing and finance verticals represent new opportunities to introduce nfs and related service offerings 
o the markets in the us and uk offer a host of complementary companies with impressive client bases to expand the distribution channels for nfs and its new generation product line 
there are established small sized companies  with relatively low valuations  which can become part of netsol on an affordable basis 
it is important to seek out these companies in order to grow our customer base  revenue and net margins by leveraging our delivery and implementation model 
funding and investor relations the fundamental challenge constantly facing the management is to achieve sustainable growth with a healthy balance sheet  without too much dilution 
in light of global opportunities for organic growth and through alliances and m a  there are certain opportunity costs for an inability to tap into these markets and areas 
therefore  management has the responsibility to broaden its horizon by prudently exploring all available vehicles to adequately capitalize the company 
smart new capital may be needed to make netsol a much healthier company with an impressive balance sheet and sufficient size to participate in and win major projects in key markets 
to summarize  the following areas would need injections of new capital either from internal operations or external injections  dependent  in part  on market conditions 
expansion in china  thailand and other emerging markets  including latin america 
expanding the north american operation to roll out netsol new generation solutions and enter cloud computing solutions 
diversify in ecommerce space such as smartoci search engine 
support of bigger it related public and defense sectors projects in the kingdom of saudi arabia with our joint venture partner 
capital expenditures for our next generation products  technology and infrastructure 
improve credit ratings for our new big customers and win the confidence of new and existing investors 
hiring and training of programmers  engineers  sales and marketing 
capital may be injected through continued exercises of options by the officers in cash  new debt and stock offerings with friends and family investors who typically hold for long term investment and can be raised without the necessity of placement agent fees  and  such other capital raising methods that are both reasonable in terms and beneficial to the company 
investor relations efforts will include working to grow our institutional investor base

aggressively positioning netsol in front of major investors conferences and road shows to be organized by redchip and other major institutions 
utilizing us mainstream media to highlight netsol s image and niche business offering

management continues to be focused on building its delivery capability and has achieved key milestones in that respect 
key projects are being delivered on time and on budget  quality initiatives are succeeding  especially in maturing internal processes 
cmmi level companies are reassessed every three years by independent consultants under the standards of the carnegie mellon university to maintain its cmmi level quality certification 
as required  netsol was reassessed in and was successfully recertified as cmmi level we believe that the cmmi standards are a key reason in netsol s demand surge worldwide 
we remain convinced that this trend will continue for all netsol offerings promoting further beneficial alliances and increasing the number and quality of our global customers 
the quest for quality standards is imperative to netsol s overall sustainability and success 
in  netsol became iso certified  a global standard and a set of best practices for information security management 
material trends affecting netsol management has identified the following material trends affecting netsol 
positive trends the global recession and consolidations have opened doors for low cost solution providers such as netsol 
the bestshoring model of netsol is a catalyst in today s environment 
global economic pressures and the recession have shifted users of it processes and technology to utilize both offshore and onshore solutions providers  to control costs and improve rois 
serious interest in netsol s next generation solution has been expressed by a few global companies 
demonstrations and workshops with key global clients and partners of have been very well received 
hence  the new generation solution appears to be gaining momentum 
gmac china  the implementation of first r for wholesale finance wfs is on track setting a strong foundation for growth 
two other key modules cms cap are in the development stage and are expected to be marketed in fiscal china has become the world s second largest economy  continuing to grow by over a year while growth in other industrial nations has declined or grown only marginally 
china s automobile and banking sectors have been unaffected by the global meltdown and their recent automobile sales statistics have outperformed all other economies

jd powers associates anticipated further strong growth in future auto sales 
it is anticipated that this market opportunity will result in further penetration by netsol into china s burgeoning leasing and finance market 
e commerce  new technologies  innovations and online activities are gaining momentum in many verticals

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition and multiple element arrangements  intangible assets  software development costs  and goodwill 
revenue recogntion the company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non cancelable  non contingent license agreement has been signed  delivery of the software has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue from the sale of licenses with major customization  modification  and development is recognized on a percentage of completion method 
revenue from the implementation of software is recognized on a percentage of completion method 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts 
revenue from training and development services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which in most instances is one year 
multiple element arrangements we may enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a number of different combinations of software licenses  consulting services  maintenance and support  as well as training and development multiple element arrangements 
vsoe of fair value for each element is based on the price for which the element is sold separately 
we determine the vsoe of fair value of each element based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial software license arrangement 
when vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe of fair value exists or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
the only exception to this guidance is when the only undelivered element is maintenance and support or other services  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of product licenses  renewals  enhancements  copyrights  trademarks  trade names  and customer lists 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
software development costs costs incurred to internally develop computer software products or to enhance an existing product are recorded as research and development costs and expensed when incurred until technological feasibility for the respective product is established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers 
the company makes on going evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product 
if such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value  the company writes off the amount which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value 
capitalized and purchased computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight line basis  whichever method results in a higher level of amortization 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase businesses combination 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
the company does impairment testing of the goodwill on an annual basis at the balance sheet date ie  june th 
in addition to our annual internal impairment testing  the company retains the services of an independent valuation specialist to validate our findings 
the source of the company s goodwill relates to the acquisition of three companies namely netsol pk tech  cq systems  uk and mccue systems  usa 
netsol pk tech operates in the asia pacific region  cq systems currently netsol technologies europe limited operates in europe  and mccue systems currently netsol technologies north america  inc operates in the north american region 
all these geographies are considered as different reporting units segments 
goodwill arising from the acquisition of these companies has been allocated to their respective geographical segments to which they relate 
while identifying reporting units segments  the company takes into consideration the reports reviewed by the ceo chief operating decision maker 
as our financial reports are analyzed on this regional basis  we have defined this as segment reporting for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
reporting unit detail of goodwill as of june  and is given below reporting units asia pacific europe north america total there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended june  and a number of factors are taken into consideration while calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
these factors include the projected after tax earnings of the reporting unit  industry price earnings ratio and a reasonable discount rate to arrive at the actual fair value of the reporting unit 
as the fair value of all reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values  no impairment was identified in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth the percentage by which the fair value exceeds the carrying value for all reporting units as on june  reporting units percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value asia pacific europe north america cash resources we were successful in maintaining our cash position by the end of our fiscal year  june  with million in cash worldwide

total consolidated net revenue for fiscal year  slightly decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decrease included a growth in maintenance fee revenue  from  to  and a growth in service revenue from  to  including consulting and implementation services 
the decrease in consolidated net revenue is attributed to approximately a decline in license revenue from  in to  in this decrease is mainly attributable to delay in signing new contacts by some prospective customers owing to worldwide recession and deteriorating geo political condition of the sub continent 
however  none of the deals in pipe have been lost by the company and the management anticipates getting the deals signed in the coming quarters 
the company is well positioned for revenue growth and has invested heavily in the development of its next generation product  which is expected to be completed during the calendar year globally  our target customers are still using old systems for maintaining their lease and finance portfolios and are now planning to replace their legacy systems 
netsol  being a trusted name in this field  is in a good position to tap new business from these companies 
the completion of this next generation software will provide the company the capability to enter into a much larger market 
we note that this product conversion may negatively impact our license fee revenue until which point the new product gains traction in the marketplace
