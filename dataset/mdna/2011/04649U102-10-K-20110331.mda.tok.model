table of contents overview during the period ended december   the company focused on its core software business through reducing unnecessary expenses and growing and maintaining its customer base and thus growing revenue 
outside of its core software business  asure accomplished three major goals 
first  on april   asure software  inc the company  entered into an amendment to the building lease originally dated january  the lease between asure software and wb one two  ltd landlord

secondly  asure sold off the last active remnants of its intellectual property business 
thirdly  the company ensured nasdaq compliance through a reverse for stock split in november on may   the company and ceridian corporation ceridian  a reseller of the company s iemployee products  entered into an agreement by which joint customers of the company and ceridian were given until july  to choose either to i contract directly with the company to continue using our goods and services  or ii continue using ceridian s offerings that may not include the company s products and services 
the company was able to retain substantially all of the monthly revenue associated with the former ceridian customers 
under the continued guidance and direction of its new directors and chief executive officer  asure will continue to implement its corporate strategy for growing its software and services business 
however  uncertainties and challenges remain and there can be no assurances that asure can successfully grow its revenues or achieve profitability and positive cash flows during calendar year revenues consolidated revenues were million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase was million  or 
consolidated revenues represent the combined revenues of the company and its subsidiaries  including sales of the company s scheduling software  time and attendance and human resource software  complementary hardware devices to enhance its software products  software maintenance and support services  installation and training services and other professional services

when purchasing iemployee s time and attendance and human resource software or meeting room manager on demand  customers do not need to install or maintain the software on their own servers 
additionally  purchasing an annual subscription may not require as stringent approval requirements as purchasing a perpetual license 
thus  purchasing meeting room manager on a subscription basis is becoming more appealing to customers as they try to meet operational goals while reducing capital expenditures 
increases were present in both of asure s product lines with netsimplicity software subscription revenue increasing million  or and iemployee software subscription revenue increasing by million  or 
netsimplicity software subscription increases were driven by new sales and the accretive nature of recurring subscription revenue

these factors contributed to the decrease in netsimplicity revenues of additionally  in february  asure sold its visual asset manager vam software product to e innovative services group eisg  llc in order to focus its netsimplicity investment on meeting room manager 
thus  vam software license revenues dec reased by in the decrease in overall meeting room manager sales and the sale of the vam software product led to the million decrease in the company s software license revenues during

hardware  maintenance  and professional services deployment all posted marginal increases over the prior year of  and respectively 
professional services revenue in iemployee declined year over year by  which is directly related to lower new sales and related implementation fees at the time of initial sale

factors in this growth include the one time nature of the perpetual software and related implementations  professional services associated with the rapidly growing meeting room manager on demand software subscriptions  new bundled professional services offerings and management s initiatives in to increase billable utilization of its professio nal services staff 
netsimplicity hardware revenues grew by year over year while iemployee hardware revenues declined by netsimplicity meeting room manager hardware revenue increased by million and was driven by meeting room manager related product sales to both new customers and an aggressive management strategy to sell to its base of netsimplicity in house customers  as well as the introduction of new products  such as digital signage and alternative vendor solutions for its interactive lcd panels 
offsetting meeting room manager hardware sales was the reduction of vam hardware sales year over year of due to its sale in february 
the decrease in iemployee hardware was driven by an abnormally large sale to one customer in november of of despite the decrease in software license sales during the year ended december   asure does continue to sell additional licenses and its cumulative license base continues to grow 
as a result  the company s related maintenance base also continues to grow  albeit by only year over year 
additionally  asure has proactively added an evergreen provision to its annual maintenance contracts in an effort to retain customers 
although the company s sales have been concentrated in certain industries  including corporate  education  healthcare  governmental  legal and non profit  asure s total customer base is widely spread across industries 
geographically  asure sells its products worldwide  but sales are largely concentrated in the united states and canada 
additionally  asure has a distribution partner in australia

subsequently  red oak nominated a slate of board directors  who were elected to replace asure s prior board during the company s annual shareholder s meeting on august  as a result of these activities  asure incurred significant legal expenses related to its efforts to privatize the compa ny  including the legal expenses required for the proxy contest related to its board of directors 
additionally  during fiscal year  the company prepared for its trial with jenkens  which started on july  also see litigation settlement discussion below 
to litigate against jenkens  the company incurred additional significant legal expenses in the year ended december  the proxy contest and the jenkens litigation have been concluded

wild basin  asure s landlord  previously paid the company certain net profit interest payments 
however  during the year ended december   wild basin communicated to asure that it needed to accumulate additional reserves  in excess of the reserves currently remitted as required by wild basin s loan agreement 
due to these additional reserves  wild basin was unable to remit any net profit interest payments to asure 
accordingly  the company recorded a reserve against its receivable from wild basin  the related million expense was included in sg a expenses for the year ended december  due to the unexpected significant legal expenses during the year ended december   asure implemented a mandatory pay reduction for all of its personnel on march  as asure evaluated its ongoing expense structure it made these reductions permanent at the end of additionally  asure terminated approximately of its workforce effective august  the net reduction in compensation  benefits  commissions and contract labor expenses from to was million  driven by these actions

r d expenses were and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately of the million decrease resulted from headcount  consulting and contract labor expenses driven by both the reduction in force and related pay reductions as well as the q outsourcing of netsimplicity development

pursuant to the terms of the amended lease  the landlord agreed to reduce the square footage leased by the company from thousand square feet to thousand square feet for the lease s remaining three years 
in addition  the monthly rent of was reduced to beginning april  in exchange for the rent and square footage reduction  the company made a onetime payment of  and agreed to forgo approximately of monthly sub tenant income it received from the excess space under the prior lease 
additionally  the company forfeited its rights to any potential future net profits interest in the lease 
the  loss consists of the following expenses  the  le ase termination fee  the write off of of subtenant lease hold improvements and in transaction costs 
these expenses were offset by the reversal of the following liabilities  of leasehold advance  of leasehold impairment and of other net liabilities 
litigation settlement on july   jenkens gilchrist  pc jenkens  asure s former legal counsel  filed a complaint against asure and compressions labs  inc  in the district court of dallas county  texas 
in its complaint  jenkens alleged a breach of contract and sought a declaratory judgment 
asure disputed jenkens claims and also sought relief through the court system 
after asure terminated jenkens  the company entered into a resolution agreement with jenkens in december under the resolution agreement  the company believed jenkens was entitled to  for all fees and expenses related to certain settlements received from licensing the company intellectual property 
jenkens interpreted the resolution agreement on broader terms and initially believed it was entitled to  as of july   asure accrued  for jenkens contingency fees related to these settlements 
the company recorded the contingency fees as part of cost of sales on its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended july  in order to properly match the expenses to the related licensing revenues 
the  accrual remained as part of asure s current liabilities through its prior fiscal year ending july  on july   the trial with jenkens commenced

impairment of assets during the year ended december   the current rental market in austin  texas continued to show depressed leasing rates 
based on this factor and the uncertainty in collecting its net profit interest payments from wild basin  management analyzed the discounted cash flows related to its wild basin property lease and subleases over the remainder of the lease term 
although asure continued to actively sublease the vacated space  the rates on the new subleases were less than originally anticipated due to the current market rates at that time 
management calculated the economic value of the lost sublease rental income and recorded an additional impairment charge of million to the company s consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization expenses were million in fiscal year ended december  and  respectively 
amortization expenses were and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively

the amortization expenses during the years ended december  and relate entirely to these acquired intangible assets see note  in the accompanying financial statements 
other income and loss other income was in fiscal year ended december  while the fiscal year ended december  had other losses of the increase was  or 
other income was and other loss of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in other income during the year ended december  was due primarily to asure selling its  shares of common stock in vtel for the gain was offset by decrease in interest income by in due primarily to decrease in cash and investments as compared to the year income taxes at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  r d credit carryforwards of approximately million and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and r d credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
minimum tax credit carryforwards carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns  the company has placed a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  no deferred tax benefits have been recorded for the tax years ended december  and during the year ended december   the valuation allowance decreased by approximately million due primarily to operations  including expirations of tax carryforwards 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward which  when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to book deferred compensation expense 
undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon 
net loss net loss was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss was million  or 
net loss as a percentage of total revenues was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in net loss during the year ended december  was due primarily to the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as well as significant one time items in including the million litigation settlement expenses and the lease impairment of million  offset by the  loss on lease agreement during the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  in thousands working capital cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities working capital was at end of december   a decrease of from on december  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in short term investments used to fund the lease amendment payment of  and losses from operations which was offset by a reduction of in current liabilities related to the lease amendment and reductions in accounts payables and other accrued liabilities 
the company believes that it can continue to generate positive cash flow and continue to increase its available working capital 
finally  although the company s working capital current assets less current liabilities is negative  million of asure s current liabilities is deferred revenue primarily prepaid saas and maintenance and service contracts and th us does not represent a significant cash liability in the near term 
excluding the million in deferred revenue  the company s working capital would be million and the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its operations 
cash used in operating activities was in the year ending december  and was million in the year ending december  the of cash used in operating activities during fiscal year was due primarily to million in net loss which was driven by the one time amendment to the company s building lease with wb one two  ltd 
the million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal year ending december  was due primarily to million in net loss and payment of the jenken s settlement of million 
cash used in investing activities was for the year ending december  due to net purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended december  due to sale of short term investments of  offset by purchases of property and equipment of asure s current operations are not capital intensive and management does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures during the next fiscal year in the company leases office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through certain leases obligate asure to pay property taxes  maintenance and insurance and include escalation clauses 
approximately or of the company s total operating lease obligations relate to its corporate office facility at wild basin in austin  texas 
asure may periodically make other commitments and thus become subject to other contractual obligations 
cash used in financing activities was for the year ending december  related to the repurchase of treasury stock for and payments on capital leases of cash provided for financing activities was for the year ended december  primarily related to the issuance of stock for offset by payments for treasury stock of and payments on capital leases of management believes it currently has sufficient cash and short term investments on hand to fund its operations during the next twelve months and beyond without needing to obtain long term financing 
therefore  the company does not anticipate that it will be affected by any credit shortage in the current economic business environment 
pursuant to asure s stock repurchase plan  the company is allowed to repurchase up to  shares adjusted for the to reverse stock split of the company s common stock 
during the year ended december  asure repurchased  shares of common stock for in total  asure has repurchased  shares for approximately million over the life of the plan 
management will periodically assess repurchasing additional shares  depending on the company s cash position  market conditions and other factors 

table of contents as of december   asure s principal source of liquidity consisted of  of current cash and cash equivalents as well as future cash generated from operations 
the decline of cash and cash equivalents of  for the fiscal year ended december  is due primarily to the lease amendment fee of  recorded during the second quarter of which is further discussed in note the company believes that it has and or will generate sufficient cash for its short and long term needs 
the company is continuing to reduce expenses and thus may utilize its cash balances in the short term to reduce long term costs 
the company expects that it will be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the next fiscal year as well 
management is focused on growing its existing software operations and looking to make strategic acquisitions in the near future 
in the short term  any acquisitions will be funded with cash on the balance sheet  cash from operations  and cash or debt raised from outside sources as well as with equity 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to grow its cash balances or limit its cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances  and it is possible that the company s future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced 
management believes that the company has sufficient capital and liquidity to fund and cultivate the growth of its current and future operations for the next months and thereafter 
however  due to uncertainties related to the timing and costs of these efforts  asure may need to raise additional capital in the future 
yet  there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital if and when it is needed 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of asure wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosur e of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year 
the more significant estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for the gross deferred tax asset  contingency legal reserves  lease impairment  useful lives of fixed assets  the determination of the fair value of its long lived assets  and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the iemployee acquisition 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the given circumstances 
these estimates could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions 
additionally  the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made 
management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness 
appropriate adjustments  if any  to the estimates used are made p rospectively based upon such periodic evaluation 
management believes the following represent asure s critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
the company recognizes software revenue in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements fasb asc 
the company s revenues consists of software license  software subscription and service fees 
revenue from the software element is earned through the licensing or right to use the company s software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  training and installation 
revenue from the sale of hardware devices is recognized upon shipment of the hardware 
 asure also sells multiple elements within a single sale 
since the company currently offers software both as a perpetual license and as software as a service  revenue recognition varies based on which of these forms of software the customer purchases 
when the company sells software licenses in a multiple element arrangement and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value is available for the undelivered element  sales revenue is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped  using the residual method  with a portion of revenue recorded as deferred unearned due to the applicable undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for the maintenance  training and installation services are based on the prices charged for the maintenance and services when sold separately 
undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer are generally restricted to post contract support  training and install 
the amount of revenue allocated to these undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those undelivered elements 
deferred revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the service period typically one year or when the service is completed 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue is generally recognized ratably  on a straight line basis over the service period of the undelivered element 
the company s training and installation services are not essential to the functionality of the company s products as such services can be provided by a third party or the customers themselves 

table of contents the company also sells software subscriptions and may at times sell related setup  implementation and professional services in the same arrangement 
setup and implementation services typically occur at start of the software subscription period  while certain professional services may not occur until several months later depending on the nature of the services and the customer requirements 
prior to january   the company recognized the total contract value of software subscriptions and related services ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contract term  beginning when the customer was able to utilize the software 
subsequent to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounts each of these elements as separate accounting units 
we allocate the value of the arrangement to each unit of accounting based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  when it exists  third party evidence of selling prices for like services or estimated selling price 
software subscription service revenues are recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription contract  while the related setup  implementation or professional services revenues are recognized upon completion 
the result of the adoption is an immaterial acceleration of setup  implementation and professional service revenues related to software subscription transactions 
the company does not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights of return  refund or cancellation have expired or acceptance has occurred 
the company arrangements with resellers do not allow for any rights of return 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized  and is comprised of deferred maintenance  service and other revenue 
deferred revenues are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the service is completed and over the terms of the arrangements  primarily ranging from one to three years 
impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc  asure reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  including those noted above  the company compares the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows  the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows 
any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period 
on may   the company and ceridian corporation ceridian  a reseller of the company s iemployee products  entered into an agreement by which joint customers of the company and ceridian were given until july  to choose either to i contract directly with the company to continue using our goods and services  or ii continue using ceridian s offerings that may not include the company s products and services 
depending on the number of customers that contracted with asure and the related pricing  the cash flows associated with the ceridian customers may vary from historical levels 
thus the company tested the ceridian contract intangible asset for impairment in accordance with fasb asc the company compared the asset s carrying amou nt against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the customers that contracted with asure over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset 
the undiscounted cash flows from the intangible asset exceeded the carrying value of the intangible asset and thus no impairment was required 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb updated fasb asc  revenue recognition fasb asc to address how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this guidance eliminates the residual method and replaces it with the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price shall be used 
if neither exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
after adoption  this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the updated fasb asc is effective for the company s revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted the updated fasb asc on january  on a prospective basis for any new contracts entered into after the date of adoption 
the adoptions of this asc update did not have a material impact to its condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended september  and however  the company cannot predict whether the impact of this update will have a material impact in future quarters due to potential changes in products and product mix 
prior to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounted for its software subscriptions and related setup  implementation and profession al services as a single accounting unit 
thus all revenues associated with such an arrangement were recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription service contract 
subsequent to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounts for each of these elements as separate accounting units 
thus the software subscription service revenue is recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription contract  while the related setup and implementation revenues are recognized upon completion 
the result of the adoption is an immaterial acceleration of setup and implementation revenues related to software subscriptions
