moreover  neither we  nor any other person  assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward looking statements 
we are under no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the filing of this annual report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business  including without limitation the disclosures made in item a of part i of this annual report under the caption risk factors 
risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements include but are not limited to our history of losses  our lack of products that have received regulatory approval  uncertainties inherent in clinical trials and product development programs  including but not limited to the fact that pre clinical and clinical results may not be indicative of results achievable in other trials or for other indications  that results from one study may not necessarily be reflected or supported by the results of other similar studies  that results from an animal study may not be indicative of results achievable in human studies  that clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete  that the outcome of any clinical trial is uncertain and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process  and that our electroporation technology and dna vaccines may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits in clinical trials  the availability of funding  the ability to manufacture vaccine candidates  the availability or potential availability of alternative therapies or treatments for the conditions targeted by us or our collaborators  including alternatives that may be more efficacious or cost effective than any therapy or treatment that we and our collaborators hope to develop  whether our proprietary rights are enforceable or defensible or infringe or allegedly infringe on rights of others or can withstand claims of invalidity  and the impact of government healthcare proposals 
overview we are engaged in the discovery  development  and delivery of a new generation of vaccines  called dna vaccines  focused on cancers and infectious diseases 
our syncon technology enables the design of universal dna based vaccines capable of providing cross protection against new  unmatched strains of pathogens such as influenza 
our electroporation dna delivery technology uses brief  controlled electrical pulses to increase cellular dna vaccine uptake 
initial human data has shown this method can safely and significantly increase gene expression and immune responses 
our clinical programs include hpv cervical cancer therapeutic  avian influenza preventative  hcv and hiv vaccines 
we are advancing preclinical research for a universal seasonal pandemic influenza vaccine as well as other products 
our partners and collaborators include university of pennsylvania  national microbiology laboratory of the public health agency of canada  mvi path  niaid nih  merck  chrontech  university of southampton  and hiv vaccines trial network hvtn 
all of our potential human products are in research and development phases 
no revenues have been generated from the sale of any such products  nor are any such revenues expected for at least the next several years 
we earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue  collaborative research and development agreements  grants and government contracts 
our product candidates will require significant additional research 
table of contents and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
all product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use  and will require significant costs for commercialization 
we may not be successful in our research and development efforts  and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable 
on june   we completed the merger resulting in our acquisition of vgx 
we believe the merger advances our ability to play a leadership role in the discovery  development  and delivery of dna vaccines 
on may   we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name from inovio biomedical corporation to inovio pharmaceuticals  inc recent developments on january   we entered into investor purchase agreements with investors relating to the issuance and sale of a  shares of common stock  and b warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units  consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants have a five year term from the date of issuance and are first exercisable commencing on the th day after the date of issuance 
we may call the warrants if the closing bid price of the common stock has been at least over trading days and certain other conditions are met 
we received net proceeds from the transaction of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent s fee and other estimated offering expenses 
on march   we entered into the agreement with vgx int l 
under the agreement  we granted vgx int l an exclusive license to the product  ie  inovio s syncon universal influenza vaccine delivered with electroporation to be developed in certain countries in asia 
as consideration for the license granted to vgx int l  we have received payment of million as a research and development initiation fee  and will receive research support  annual license maintenance fees and royalties on net product sales 
in addition  contingent upon achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones  we will receive development payments over the term of the agreement 
the agreement also provides us with exclusive rights to supply devices for clinical and commercial purposes including single use components to vgx int l for use in the product 
the term of the agreement commenced upon execution and will extend on a country by country basis until the last to expire of all royalty periods for the territory as such term is defined in the agreement for any product in that country  unless the agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions as a result of breach  by mutual agreement  or by vgx int l s right to terminate without cause upon prior written notice 
in january  we announced that we expanded our existing license agreement with the university of pennsylvania  adding exclusive worldwide licenses for technology and intellectual property for novel dna vaccines against pandemic influenza  chikungunya  and foot and mouth disease 
the amendment also encompasses new chemokine and cytokine molecular adjuvant technologies 
the technology was developed in the university of pennsylvania laboratory of professor david b 
weiner  a pioneer in the field of dna vaccines  and chairman of our scientific advisory board 
under the terms of the original license agreement completed in  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop multiple dna plasmids and constructs with the potential to treat and or prevent hiv  hcv  hpv and influenza and included molecular adjuvants 
these prior and most recent agreements and amendments provide for royalty payments  based on future sales  to the university of pennsylvania 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future due to our commitment to our research and development programs  the funding of preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of general and administrative activities 

table of contents critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition 
license fees are comprised of initial fees and milestone payments derived from collaborative licensing arrangements 
we continue to recognize non refundable milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones upon which we have earned the milestone payment  provided the milestone payment is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
we defer payments for milestone events which are reasonably assured and recognize them ratably over the minimum remaining period of our performance obligations 
payments for milestones that are not reasonably assured are treated as the culmination of a separate earnings process and are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved 
we have adopted a strategy of co developing or licensing our gene delivery technology for specific genes or specific medical indications 
accordingly  we have entered into collaborative research and development agreements and have received funding for pre clinical research and clinical trials 
payments under these agreements  which are non refundable  are recorded as revenue as the related research expenditures are incurred pursuant to the terms of the agreements and provided collectability is reasonably assured 
we receive non refundable grants under available government programs 
government grants towards current expenditures are recorded as revenue when there is reasonable assurance that we have complied with all conditions necessary to receive the grants  collectability is reasonably assured  and as the expenditures are incurred 
research and development expenses 
since our inception  virtually all of our activities have consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our electroporation technologies and dna vaccines 
research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
valuation and impairment evaluations of goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
as of december   our intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of vgx and inovio as  and additional intangibles including previously capitalized patent costs and license costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we are concurrently conducting phase i and pre clinical trials using acquired intangibles  and we have entered into certain significant licensing agreements for use of these acquired intangibles 
historically we have recorded patents at cost and amortized these costs using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the patents or years  whichever is less 
patent costs consist of the consideration paid for patents and related legal costs 
effective june   in connection with our acquisition of vgx  all new patent costs will be expensed as incurred 
patent costs currently capitalized will continue to be amortized over the expected life of the patent 
the effect of this change was immaterial to prior periods 
license costs are recorded based on the fair value of consideration paid and amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the expected useful life of the underlying patents or the term of the related license agreement 

table of contents the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if impairment is indicated  we reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to fair value 
while our current and historical operating and cash flow losses are potential indicators of impairment  we believe the future cash flows to be received from our intangible assets will exceed the intangible assets carrying value  and accordingly  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
our accounting policy with respect to reviewing goodwill for impairment is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value including allocated goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss  if any 
we test goodwill for impairment at the entity level  which is considered our reporting unit 
our estimate of fair value is determined using both the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach 
the discounted cash flow method estimates future cash flows of our business for a certain discrete period and then discounts them to their present value 
the guideline public company method computes value indicators multiples from the operating data of the selected publicly traded guideline companies 
after these multiples were evaluated  appropriate value indicators were selected and applied to the operating statistics of the reporting unit to arrive at indications of value 
specifically  we relied upon the application of total invested capital based valuation multiples for each guideline company 
in applying the income and market approaches  premiums and discounts were determined and applied to estimate the fair values of the reporting unit 
to arrive at the indicated value of equity under each approach  we then assigned a relative weighting to the resulting values from each approach to determine whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  thus requiring step two of the impairment test 
we conduct the impairment test annually on november th for each fiscal year for which goodwill is evaluated for impairment 
we are also aware of the requirement to evaluate goodwill for impairment at other times should circumstances arise 
to date  we have concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore  step two of the impairment test has never been performed 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value stock option awards 
we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 

table of contents registered common stock warrants 
we account for registered common stock warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify registered warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the registered warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as other income expense  net 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the audited consolidated financial data for the years ended december  and december  is presented in the following table and the results of these two periods are used in the discussion thereafter 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease revenues license fee and milestone payments revenue under collaborative research and development arrangements grants and miscellaneous revenue total revenues operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net interest income  net loss from investment in affiliated entity net loss net loss attributable to non controlling interest net loss attributable to inovio pharmaceuticals  inc revenue our revenue consists of license fees  milestone payments  and amounts received from collaborative research and development arrangements and grants 

table of contents our total revenue decreased million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to decreases in license fees and revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements offset by an increase in grants and miscellaneous revenue 
the million decrease in license fees and milestone payments for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to no revenues recognized in under the wyeth collaboration and licensing agreement 
in we accelerated and recognized million of deferred revenue due to the cancellation of the wyeth agreement in july the decrease was also attributable to less revenue recognized from other smaller license agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by revenues recognized in from the vgx int l collaboration and license agreement 
the  decrease in revenue under collaborative research and development arrangements during the year ended december  as compared to was due to no revenues recognized under our research and collaboration agreement with merck  as we have provided the majority of the required device development for use in their clinical trials 
we believe that development activities will be limited until trial results are obtained 
the million increase in grant and miscellaneous revenue for the year ended december  as compared to  was primarily due to higher revenues recognized from our contract with the niaid of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the niaid contract  which was modified in september  has an initial term of five years with two one year options period of performance is september  september  including the two options 
the current value of the contract for the five years is million with option years six and seven valued at million and million  respectively  for a total potential value of million  and will fund research and development for hiv dna based vaccines delivered via our proprietary electroporation system 
the increase is also attributed to the  grant awarded in october under the patient protection and affordable care act of ppaca 
the grant was related to three of our projects  including the phase ii clinical trial of vgx  a therapeutic vaccine for cervical dysplasia and cancer as well as development projects for syncon universal flu and dengue vaccines 
the ppaca provides small and mid sized biotech  pharmaceutical and medical device companies with up to a tax credit for investments in qualified therapeutic discoveries for tax years and  or a grant for the same amount tax free 
these increases were partially offset by less revenue recognized under our path malaria vaccine initiative mvi contract and from the department of defense us army grant 
path is an international nonprofit organization funded by private donors 
we have a research program and agreement with the path mvi to evaluate in a preclinical feasibility study our syncon dna vaccine development platform to target antigens from plasmodium species and deliver them intradermally using the cellectra electroporation device 
the initial agreement with mvi was for  and was completed in february in september we entered into an amended agreement with path to further this study in non human primates 
the amended agreement has a total value of  and is expected to be completed by august the us army grant had a total value of  and was completed in may this project funded research and development of dna based vaccines delivered via our proprietary electroporation system and focused on identifying dna vaccine candidates with the potential to provide rapid  robust immunity to protect against bio warfare and bioterror attacks 
research and development expenses the million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to  was primarily due to higher costs related to work performed for the niaid contract  higher outside services and contract labor expenses related to research and development projects  higher outside engineering professional services related to cellectra development  higher clinical trial costs and higher personnel costs due to greater employee headcount on average throughout the year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses incurred by our norwegian subsidiaries as these entities ceased operations in as well as lower stock based compensation expense 

table of contents our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our products through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter our plan based on new circumstances or events 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include business development expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to lower legal and related fees associated with the merger and other corporate matters 
upon closing of the merger in  we incurred costs such as merger related compensation to key employees  higher accounting  audit and valuation fees  higher insurance costs  and higher employee stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of all inovio stock options 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in expenses incurred by our norwegian subsidiaries as these entities ceased operations in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in recurring operating expenses including the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the merger due to a full year operating as a combined company in when compared to a partial year in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award reduced by estimated forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
total compensation cost for our stock plans for the years ended december  and was  and million  of which  and  was included in research and development expenses and  and million was included in general and administrative expenses  respectively 
at december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost  related to unvested stock options  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years  as compared to million for the year ended december  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
total stock based compensation for options granted to non employees for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
other income expense  net we recorded other income expense  net  for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the increase in other income expense  net  is primarily due to the revaluation of registered common stock warrants issued by us in october  august and july we revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value 
if unexercised  the warrants will expire at various dates between october and july interest income  net interest income expense  net  for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income expense  net  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense related to the convertible debt obtained in connection with the merger which was converted to common stock in august  offset by lower interest income earned due to a lower cash and investments balance 

table of contents gain loss from investment in affiliated entity gain loss is a result of the change in the fair market value of the investment in vgx int l as of december  income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal  california and pennsylvania income tax purposes of approximately million  million and million  respectively  net of the net operating losses that will expire due to irc section limitations 
we also had federal and california research and development tax credits of approximately  and million  respectively  net of the federal research and development credits that will expire due to irc section limitations 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credits will begin to expire in utilization of net operating losses and credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended

table of contents our total revenue increased million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to increases in license fee revenues and increase in grants and miscellaneous revenue  offset by a decrease in revenues under collaborative research and development arrangements 
the million increase in license fees and milestone payments for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to the acceleration of million of deferred revenues recognized as a result of the cancellation of the wyeth collaboration and licensing agreement in july revenue from other license agreements remained consistent during the years ended december  and the  decrease in revenue under collaborative research and development arrangements during the year ended december  as compared to was due to a decrease in merck collaborative research billings of  as well as no billings to wyeth in from our collaborative agreement related to the commercialization of the elgen device 
revenues from collaborative research and development arrangements are expected to continue to decline  as wyeth terminated its collaboration and licensing agreement as of july and under our research and collaboration agreement with merck  we have provided the majority of the required device development for use in their clinical trials and we believe that development activities will be limited until trial results are obtained 
the million increase in grant and miscellaneous revenue for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to revenues recognized from our contract with the niaid and the path malaria vaccine initiative mvi of million and  respectively  since june   and higher revenues recognized from the us army grant of  at december   the original niaid contract was for five years with two one year options period of performance is september  september  including the two options

we have a research program and agreement with the path mvi to evaluate in a preclinical feasibility study our syncon dna vaccine development platform to target antigens from plasmodium species and deliver them intradermally using the cellectra electroporation device 
the original agreement with mvi was for  and ran through february the us army grant had a total value of  funded research and development of dna based vaccines delivered via our proprietary electroporation system and ran through may this project focused on identifying dna vaccine candidates with the potential to provide rapid  robust immunity to protect against bio warfare and bioterror attacks 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized revenue of  and  respectively  attributable to the operations of our norwegian subsidiary  inovio as  which amounted to approximately and of our total revenue 
inovio as revenue primarily consists of amounts received from grants and licensing revenue 
inovio as was dissolved in december operating activities for inovio as are now conducted in the united states 
research and development expenses the million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher costs related to work performed for the niaid contract as well as higher other outside services and contract labor expenses related to research and development projects 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses incurred by our norwegian subsidiaries as these entities were winding down operations during  as well as a decrease in outside lab testing and lab and engineering supply purchases 
research and development expenses attributable to inovio as were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our products through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include business development expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher legal and related fees associated with the merger and other corporate matters 
upon closing of the merger  we also incurred costs that would have not been incurred in the prior year  such as merger related compensation to key employees  higher amortization expense as a result of the intangible assets that were acquired from vgx  and higher employee stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of all inovio stock options 
the increase was also attributed to higher accounting  audit and valuation fees related to the merger and the combined company 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside consulting services related to partnering our secta therapy program and other corporate advisory services 
additionally  as a result of the dissolution of our norwegian subsidiaries  general and administrative expenses were offset by the reversal of an  deferred tax liability previously recorded in connection with the original acquisition of the norwegian entity 
general and administrative costs attributable to inovio as were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award reduced by estimated forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
total compensation cost for our stock plans for the years ended december  and was million and million  of which  and  was included in research and development expenses and million and  was included in general and administrative expenses  respectively 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost  related to unvested stock options  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years  as compared to  for the year ended december  total stock based compensation for options granted to non employees for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
other income expense  net we recorded other income expense  net  for the years ended december  and of million and  respectively 
the increase in other income expense  net  is primarily due to the revaluation of registered common stock warrants issued by us in october  august and july we revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value

the decrease in interest income expense  net  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a lower average cash and investments balance and lower average interest rate during the year  as well as an increase in interest expense related to the convertible debt obtained in connection with the merger 
this debt was converted to common stock in august 
table of contents gain loss from investment in affiliated entity gain loss is a result of the change in the investment fair market value as of december  income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal  california and pennsylvania income tax purposes of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and california research and development tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credits will begin to expire in utilization of net operating losses and credits are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary uses of cash have been to finance research and development activities including clinical trial activities in the oncology  dna vaccines and other immunotherapy areas of our business 
since inception  we have satisfied our cash requirements principally from proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
working capital and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of million  as compared to million as of december  the decrease in working capital during the year ended december  was primarily due to expenditures related to our research and development activities  as well as various general and administrative expenses related to legal  consultants  accounting and audit  and corporate development 
these expenditures were offset by the million received from vgx int l in connection with the march collaboration and license agreement  as well as a decrease in the valuation of registered common stock warrants 
in january  the company entered into investor purchase agreements with investors relating to the issuance and sale of a  shares of common stock  and b warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units  consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the company received net proceeds from the transaction of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent s fee and estimated offering expenses payable by the company 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  was primarily the result of the million received from vgx int l in connection with the march collaboration and license agreement as well as a decrease in legal and other expenses paid associated with the merger and other corporate matters offset by increased spending on clinical  engineering and other research and development activities to support our programs 
prior to july  we held auction rate securities ars  which were municipal debt obligations with an underlying long term maturity 
due to conditions in the global credit markets these securities were not liquid as of december  in december  we  via our wholly owned subsidiary genetronics  which held the ars  accepted an offer of ars rights from ubs which permitted us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time during the period of june  through july  on july   we exercised the ars rights  and we sold the remaining ars at par value 

table of contents in conjunction with the acceptance of the ars rights  we also amended our existing loan agreement with ubs bank usa  increasing the existing credit line up to million  with the ars pledged as collateral 
we fully drew down on the line of credit in december on july   upon exercise of our ars rights  the line of credit was paid in full 
we initiated an at the market equity distribution agreement in august and raised million net of expenses  as of december  in january we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through this program 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have operated at a loss since  and we expect to continue to operate at a loss for some time 
the amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase  as it will be expensive to continue research and development efforts 
if these activities are successful and if we receive approval from the fda to market our dna vaccine products  then even more funding will be required to market and sell the approved vaccine products and equipment 
we cannot predict the outcome of the above matters at this time 
we are evaluating potential collaborations as an additional way to fund operations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in united states interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  and the recent fluctuations in interest rates and availability of funding in the credit markets primarily impact the performance of our investments 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 

table of contents fair value measurements we account for our common stock warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify registered warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability that is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
as of december   we no longer hold trading securities 
previously  we classified all of our investment securities consisting of ars issued primarily by municipalities as trading securities and reported them on the consolidated balance sheet at market value 
in december  we  via our wholly owned subsidiary genetronics  which held the ars  accepted an offer of ars rights from our investment advisor  ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag  or ubs 
the ars rights permitted us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time during the period of june  through july  on july  we exercised the ars rights  and we sold the remaining ars held by us at par value

accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  with the exception of the valuation of our equity investment in vgx int l which is denominated in south korean won 
we do not have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place 
certain transactions related to us are denominated primarily in foreign currencies  including euros  british pounds  canadian dollars  south korean won and singapore dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where we conduct business  including the impact of the existing crisis in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the united states dollar and the noted foreign currencies 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes
