table of contents we manage our business as three separate operational segments exploration and production  marketing  gathering and compression  and service operations  which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary we are the second largest producer of natural gas and a top producer of oil and natural gas liquids in the us we own interests in approximately  producing natural gas and oil wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  of which is natural gas 
our strategy is focused on discovering and developing unconventional natural gas and oil fields onshore in the us  primarily in the barnett shale in the fort worth basin of north central texas  the haynesville and bossier shales in northwestern louisiana and east texas  the fayetteville shale in the arkoma basin of central arkansas  and the marcellus shale in the northern appalachian basin of west virginia and pennsylvania 
we also have substantial operations in the liquids rich plays of the eagle ford shale in south texas  the granite wash  cleveland  tonkawa and mississippian plays in the anadarko basin in western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  the niobrara shale  frontier and codell plays in the powder river and dj basins of wyoming and colorado and the avalon  bone spring  wolfcamp and wolfberry plays in the permian and delaware basins of west texas and southern new mexico  as well as various other plays  both conventional and unconventional  in the mid continent  williston basin  appalachian basin  south texas  texas gulf coast and ark la tex regions of the us we have also vertically integrated our operations and own substantial midstream  compression  drilling and oilfield service assets 
as described below  we have agreed to sell our fayetteville shale assets in a transaction expected to close in the first half of chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or 
during  we replaced tcfe of production with an estimated tcfe of new proved reserves  for a reserve replacement rate of 
the proved reserve movement included tcfe of extensions  tcfe of downward performance revisions and tcfe of positive revisions resulting from an increase in the twelve month trailing average natural gas and oil prices between december  and december  during  we acquired tcfe of estimated proved reserves and divested tcfe of estimated proved reserves 
chesapeake continued the industry s most active drilling program in and drilled  gross net operated wells and participated in another  gross net wells operated by other companies 
the company s drilling success rate was for both company operated and non operated wells 
also during  we invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs and million in non operated wells using an average of non operated rigs for total drilling and completion costs of billion  net of drilling and completion cost carries of billion 
our average daily production for of bcfe consisted of bcf on a natural gas equivalent basis and  bbls on a natural gas equivalent basis and was an increase of mmcfe  or  over the bcfe of daily production for total production for was  tcfe  an increase of bcfe  or  over total production of bcfe 
this was our st consecutive year of sequential production growth 
since  chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us this position includes the largest inventory of us natural gas shale play leasehold million net acres as well as the largest combined leasehold position in two of the three largest new unconventional liquids rich plays in the us the eagle ford shale and the niobrara shale 
we are currently using operated rigs to further develop our inventory of approximately  net drillsites 
implementing our strategy in recognition of the value gap between oil and natural gas prices  during the past two years chesapeake has directed a significant portion of its technological  geo scientific  leasehold acquisition and drilling expertise to identifying  securing and commercializing new unconventional liquids rich plays 
this planned transition will result in a more balanced portfolio between natural gas and liquids 
to date  we have built leasehold positions and established production in multiple unconventional liquids rich plays on approximately million net leasehold acres 
in  we 
table of contents invested approximately billion  net of divestitures  primarily in liquids rich acreage  and we allocated approximately of our billion drilling and completion capital expenditures to these plays  compared to in our production of oil and natural gas liquids was  bbls per day during  a increase over the average for as a result of the increased development of our unconventional liquids rich plays 
we are projecting that the portion of drilling and completion capital expenditures allocated to liquids development will reach in and in  and we expect to increase our oil and natural gas liquids production through our drilling activities to more than  bbls per day  or of total production  by year end this shift to a greater emphasis on liquids production is a continuation of our general business strategy outlined in item business 
our goal is to create value for investors by focusing on developing unconventional resource plays onshore in the us we do so by growing through the drillbit we are the most active driller in the us  have our own fleet of drilling rigs and are currently using operated rigs 
our integrated marketing  gathering  compression and trucking services operations support our drilling activities so that we are able to manage the development of our leasehold efficiently and strategically 
controlling substantial land and drilling location inventories and building regional scale we have been first movers in capturing both natural gas and liquids rich unconventional leasehold and resources 
during  we invested heavily in a large number of highly competitive liquids rich unconventional plays in order to accelerate our transition to increased liquids production 
we now have achieved many of our leasehold acquisition goals and are becoming a significant seller of leasehold through new industry participation agreements and the pending sale of our fayetteville shale assets 
developing proprietary technological advantages we support the scale of our operations with what we believe is the nation s largest inventory of d seismic information and our state of the art reservoir technology center  or rtc 
the rtc provides us a substantial competitive advantage  enabling us among other things to more quickly  accurately and confidentially analyze core data from wells drilled through unconventional formations on a proprietary basis and then identify new plays and leasing opportunities ahead of our competition and reduce the likelihood of investing in plays that ultimately are not commercial 
our d seismic data permits us to image reservoirs of natural gas and oil that might otherwise remain undiscovered and to drill our horizontal wells more accurately inside the targeted formation 
focusing on low costs we minimize lease operating costs and general and administrative expenses through focused activities  vertical integration and increasing scale 
as of december   our operated wells accounted for approximately of our daily production volume  providing us with a high degree of operational flexibility and cost control 
mitigating natural gas and oil price risk we actively seek to manage our exposure to adverse market prices for natural gas and oil through our hedging program 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged natural gas and oil production 
our realized cash hedging gains for were billion and since january  have been billion 
using industry participation agreements through industry participation property sales  we have recouped substantially all of our lease acquisition costs in six of our significant unconventional operating areas  and we hold leasehold in new plays which we believe will be best developed through future industry participation agreements 
in addition  drilling cost carries allow us to accelerate the development of new plays at a reduced cost to us 
we pioneered the industry participation model of unconventional natural gas and oil development  and many other e p companies have followed with their own industry participation agreements in the past two years 
our strategic and financial plan for  announced on january  as our plan  calls for a reduction in our outstanding long term debt while growing net natural gas and oil production by by the end of we expect to achieve the reduction in debt through asset monetizations 
among the several benefits of lower debt are lower borrowing costs  and we believe improved credit metrics will lead to a more favorable debt rating by the major ratings agencies 
our goal of a reduction in debt by year end is part of our liability management plan begun in during  we issued in private placements million shares of two series of our cumulative non voting convertible preferred stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately billion 
we used the net proceeds of these preferred stock offerings to redeem in whole billion in principal amount of four series of our outstanding senior notes 
additionally  through tender offers followed by redemptions  we purchased billion aggregate principal amount of three additional series of senior notes 
we funded the purchase of the notes tendered and redeemed with 
table of contents proceeds from a billion public offering of two series of senior notes 
we retired all series of our outstanding senior notes that were issued under our more restrictive indentures 
excess funds from our offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility 
during  we plan to take steps to extend the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness at advantageous rates 
on february   the company issued billion principal amount of senior notes due in a registered public offering 
we applied the net proceeds of million from the offering to our revolving bank credit facility balance and plan to use proceeds from asset sales to retire at least billion of our shorter dated senior notes and also to reduce borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
asset monetizations were also key elements of our strategic and financial plan in and early  as described below 
industry participation agreements in  chesapeake completed its fourth and fifth significant industry participation agreements in unconventional natural gas and oil plays 
in january  total e p usa  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of total sa total  purchased a undivided interest in  net acres of our barnett shale leasehold  along with bcfe of estimated proved reserves  for approximately million in cash plus million of drilling and completion carries due from the effective date of the transaction to the closing date 
total agreed to fund of our share of future drilling and completion expenditures in the barnett shale until it has paid a total of billion in drilling and completion carries  which we expect to occur by year end in november  a wholly owned subsidiary of cnooc limited cnooc purchased a undivided interest in  net acres of our eagle ford shale leasehold  along with bcfe of estimated proved reserves  for approximately billion in cash 
in addition  cnooc agreed to fund of our share of drilling and completion costs in the eagle ford shale until an additional billion has been paid  which we expect to occur by year end all proceeds from these transactions are reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
both total and cnooc have the right to participate proportionately with us in any additional leasehold we acquire in the barnett shale and the eagle ford shale  respectively  at cost plus a fee 
the following table provides information about our remaining industry participation agreement drilling and completion carries as of december  shale play industry participation agreement partner date carries remaining in millions marcellus statoil november  barnett total january eagle ford cnooc november  on february   we entered into an industry participation agreement with a wholly owned us subsidiary of cnooc limited cnooc to develop our niobrara shale play in the dj and powder river basins in northeast colorado and southeast wyoming 
under the terms of the industry participation agreement  cnooc acquired a undivided interest in approximately  net acres of our leasehold 
we received million in cash at closing  and cnooc has agreed to fund of our share of drilling and completion costs until an additional million has been paid  which we expect to occur by year end in addition  cnooc has the right to a participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the area at cost plus a fee 
the drilling and completion carries in our industry participation agreements create a significant cost advantage that allows us to continue to lower finding costs 
during and  our drilling and completion costs included the benefit of approximately billion and billion  respectively  of drilling and completion carries 
our drilling and completion costs for through will continue to be partially offset by the use of our remaining drilling and completion carries associated with our industry participation agreements 
volumetric production payments we completed three volumetric production payments vpps in  bringing the total of such transactions to eight 
the company s sixth vpp was completed in february for proceeds of approximately million  or per mcfe 
in june  we completed our seventh vpp for proceeds of approximately million  or per mcfe 

table of contents in september  we completed our eighth vpp for proceeds of approximately billion  or per mcfe 
the cash proceeds from these transactions are reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
other asset sales in  we sold non core proved and unproved properties for proceeds of approximately million 
during  as part of our industry participation agreements with total  statoil and pxp  we sold interests in additional leasehold in the barnett  marcellus and haynesville shale plays for proceeds of approximately million that had an estimated original cost to us of million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions are reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
chesapeake midstream partners  lp ipo and asset sale on august   chesapeake midstream partners  lp nyse chkm  which we and gip formed to own  operate  develop and acquire midstream assets  completed an initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the closing of the offering and pursuant to the terms of our contribution agreement with gip  chkm distributed to gip the approximate million of net proceeds from the exercise of the offering over allotment option  and chesapeake and gip contributed the interests of their midstream joint venture operating subsidiary to chkm 
chesapeake and gip hold and  respectively  of all outstanding limited partner interests  and chesapeake and gip each have a interest in the general partner of chkm 
chkm makes quarterly distributions to its partners  and at the current annual rate of per unit  chesapeake receives quarterly distributions of approximately million in respect of its limited partner and general partner interests 
in  we received cash distributions of million from chkm and its predecessor joint venture 
we account for our investment in chkm under the equity method 
during  we recorded positive equity method adjustments of million for our share of chkm s income and recorded accretion adjustments of million for our share of equity in excess of cost 
as a result of chkm s initial public offering  we recognized a million gain on our investment  which represented our proportionate share of the excess of offering proceeds over the carrying value of our investment in chkm and is reported in earnings losses from equity investees on our consolidated statements of operations 
on december   we sold our springridge natural gas gathering system and related facilities in the haynesville shale to chkm for million and entered into ten year gathering and compression agreements with chkm 
additional information on the transaction is included in item under marketing  gathering and compression midstream gathering operations 
pending and planned asset sales fayetteville shale 
on february   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of bhp billiton to sell all of our fayetteville shale assets  including approximately  net acres of leasehold and producing natural gas properties and midstream assets with approximately miles of pipeline  for billion in cash before certain deductions and standard closing adjustments 
in the fayetteville shale  our current net production is approximately mmcfe per day 
estimated proved reserves attributable to the fayetteville shale as of december  were tcfe  or approximately of our total proved reserves 
as part of the transaction  we have agreed to provide essential services for up to one year for bhp billiton s fayetteville shale properties for an agreed upon fee 
closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including filings under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and with the committee on foreign investment in the united states 
closing is expected to occur in the first half of frac tech holdings  llc and chaparral energy  inc asset sales 
we plan to sell our equity interest in frac tech holdings  llc and our equity interest in chaparral energy  inc each of the foregoing proposed transactions is subject to changes in market conditions and other factors  and there can be no assurance that we will complete any or all of these transactions on a timely basis or at all 
other 
during  the company expects to enter into additional asset monetizations  including industry participation agreements in liquids rich plays  new vpps  certain midstream assets sales and various other smaller planned sales 

table of contents capital expenditures our exploration  development and acquisition activities require us to make substantial capital expenditures 
our current budgeted drilling and completion capital expenditures  net of drilling and completion carries  are billion in and billion in we anticipate funding all or substantially all budgeted drilling and completion capital expenditures using cash flow from operations in and we plan to fund our leasehold acquisition capital expenditures  together with other capital expenditure requirements  with a combination of revolving bank credit facility borrowings and proceeds from asset monetizations 
as of december   we had made commitments to acquire additional proved and unproved properties in various transactions during the next twelve months for approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity we use to fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and repay debt 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income  excluding various non cash items such as impairments of assets  depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes and changes in our derivative instruments 
see the discussion below under results of operations 
changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas and oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
assuming future nymex natural gas settlement prices average per mcf for and including the effect of the company s open derivatives as of february   closed contracts and previously collected call premiums  the company estimates its average natural gas price will be per mcf for this estimate does not include the effect of basis differentials and gathering costs 
our natural gas and oil derivatives as of december  are detailed in item a of this report 
depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and management s view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
our billion corporate revolving bank credit facility  our million midstream revolving bank credit facility and cash and cash equivalents are other sources of liquidity 
we use the credit facilities and cash on hand to fund daily operating activities and capital expenditures as needed 
we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  and we borrowed billion and repaid billion in from our revolving bank credit facilities 
our corporate facility is secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves 
a significant portion of our natural gas and oil reserves are currently unencumbered and therefore available to be pledged as additional collateral if needed to respond to borrowing base and collateral redeterminations our lenders might make in the future 
accordingly  we believe our borrowing capacity under this facility will not be reduced as a result of any such future redeterminations 
our midstream facility is secured by substantially all of our wholly owned midstream assets and is not subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations

in september  we received million from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our midstream joint venture agreement with gip 
in june  we received net proceeds of million from the mortgage financing of our regional barnett shale headquarters building in fort worth  texas 
the interest only loan has a five year term at a floating rate of prime plus basis points 
at our option  we may prepay the loan in full without penalty beginning in year four 
in april  we financed real estate surface assets in the barnett shale area in and around fort worth  texas for net proceeds of approximately million and entered into a master lease agreement under which we agreed to lease the assets for years for approximately million to million annually 
this lease transaction was recorded as a financing lease 
in  and  we received million and million  and paid million  respectively  for settlements of derivatives which were classified as cash flows from financing activities 
in  we received cash distributions of million from chkm and its predecessor 
in addition  we received cash distributions of million from our equity investee  frac tech holdings  llc 
these cash distributions were accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as cash flows from operating activities 
our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
we refer you to the table under investing activities below  which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and our other investing activities for  and we retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues 
in addition  changes in drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 

table of contents on june   we redeemed in whole for an aggregate redemption price of approximately billion  plus accrued interest  approximately million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due  million in principal amount of our senior notes due and approximately million in principal amount of our senior notes due associated with these redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in on july   we redeemed in whole for a redemption price of approximately million  plus accrued interest  million in principal amount of our senior notes due associated with the redemption  we recognized a loss of million in on august   we completed tender offers to purchase for cash million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due on september   we redeemed the remaining million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due based on the redemption provisions in the indentures

the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend of common stock from to per share beginning with the dividend paid in july we paid dividends on our preferred stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to the issuance of million shares of preferred stock and the decrease from to was a result of conversions and exchanges of preferred stock into common stock during and credit risk derivative instruments that enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility expose us to credit risk from our counterparties 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers  and we attempt to limit our exposure to non performance by any single counterparty 
during the more than years we have engaged in hedging activities  we have experienced a counterparty default only once lehman brothers in september  and the total loss recorded in that instance was immaterial 
on december   our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments were spread among counterparties 
our multi counterparty secured hedging facility includes of our counterparties which are required to secure their natural gas and oil hedging obligations in excess of defined thresholds 
we use this facility for all of our commodity hedging 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil million at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
during and  we recognized nominal amounts of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables 
during  we recognized million of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the majority of the increase in investing activities in was the result of our increased acquisition of unproved properties  primarily in liquids rich areas  and exploration and development activities 
our investing activities in reflected our increasing focus on acquiring unproved properties in developing natural gas shale plays  converting our resource inventory into production  redeploying our capital by selling natural gas and oil properties with lower rates of return and increasing our investment in properties with higher return potential 
investing activities in were at a reduced rate in response to a low natural gas price environment  lower demand and the benefit of our drilling cost carries

bank credit facilities we utilize two revolving bank credit facilities  described below  as sources of liquidity 
corporate credit facility a midstream credit facility b in millions borrowing capacity maturity date december july facility structure senior secured revolving senior secured revolving amount outstanding as of december  letters of credit outstanding as of december  a borrower is chesapeake exploration  llc b borrower is chesapeake midstream operating  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake midstream development  lp our credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants 
although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  neither of our credit facilities contains provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings 
corporate credit facility 
our billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank  na  or the federal funds effective rate plus  both of which are subject to a margin that varies from to per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  or ii the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin that varies from to per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of per annum 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to ebitda ratio  in each case as defined in the agreement 
we were in 
table of contents compliance with all covenants under the agreement at december  if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million or more  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
the facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
midstream credit facility 
our million midstream syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems for our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations 
borrowings under the midstream credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries the restricted subsidiaries of chesapeake midstream development  lp cmd  itself a wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake  and bear interest at our option at either i the greater of the reference rate of wells fargo bank  national association  the federal funds effective rate plus  and the one month libor plus  all of which are subject to a margin that varies from to per annum according to the most recent leverage ratio described below or ii the eurodollar rate  which is based on the libor plus a margin that varies from to per annum according to the most recent leverage ratio 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of per annum 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
the midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of cmd and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of indebtedness to ebitda and an interest coverage ratio based on the ratio of ebitda to interest expense  in each case as defined in the agreement 
the leverage ratio increases during any three quarter period  beginning in the quarter in which cmd makes a material disposition of assets to our master limited partnership midstream affiliate  chesapeake midstream partners  lp as of december   the leverage ratio increased for a three fiscal quarter period beginning october  due to the sale of the springridge gathering system as it was classified as a material disposition of assets 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at december  if cmd or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
the midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of cmd and its restricted subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
hedging facility we have a multi counterparty hedge facility with counterparties that have committed to provide approximately tcfe of hedging capacity and an aggregate mark to market capacity of billion under the terms of the facility 
in february  we amended the agreement for the hedge facility primarily to allow us to protect our natural gas liquids production from price volatility and to allow for greater flexibility when hedging our anticipated production 
as of december   we had hedged a total of tcfe of our future production under the facility 
the multi counterparty facility allows us to enter into cash settled natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids price and basis derivatives with the counterparties 
our obligations under the multi counterparty facility are secured by proved reserves  the value of which must cover the fair value of the transactions outstanding under the facility by at least times  and guarantees by our subsidiaries that also guarantee our corporate revolving bank credit facility and indentures 
the counterparties obligations under the facility must be secured by cash or short term us treasury instruments to the extent that any mark to market amounts they owe to chesapeake exceed defined thresholds 
the maximum volume based hedging capacity under the facility is governed by the expected production of the pledged reserve collateral  and volume based hedging limits are applied separately to price and basis hedges 
in addition  there are volume based sub limits for natural gas and oil hedges 
chesapeake has significant flexibility with regard to releases and or substitutions of pledged reserves  provided that certain collateral coverage and other requirements are met 
the facility does not have a maturity date 
counterparties to the agreement have the right to cease entering into hedges with the company on a prospective basis as long as obligations associated with any existing transactions in the facility continue to be satisfied in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

table of contents senior note obligations in addition to outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities discussed above  as of december   senior notes represented approximately billion of our total debt and consisted of the following in millions senior notes due senior notes due euro denominated senior notes due a senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due contingent convertible senior notes due b contingent convertible senior notes due b contingent convertible senior notes due b discount on senior notes c interest rate derivatives d a the principal amount shown is based on the dollar euro exchange rate of to as of december  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information on our related foreign currency derivatives 
b the holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase  in cash  all or a portion of their notes at of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five  ten  fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date 
the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process 
one such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter 
convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and  as a result  the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the first quarter of under this provision 
the notes are also convertible  at the holder s option  during specified five day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock 
in general  upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note  the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount

chesapeake has commitments to purchase any natural gas and oil associated with certain volumetric production payment transactions based on market prices at the time of production and the purchased gas will be resold 
under minimum volume throughput agreements  chesapeake has agreed to move fixed volumes of natural gas over certain time periods  usually multiple years  through certain midstream systems 
at the end of the term or annually  chesapeake will be invoiced for any shortfalls in such volume commitments 
hedging activities natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at its quarterly board meetings 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  call options  put options  knockout swaps and basis protection swaps 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our natural gas and oil production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our derivative contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile and chesapeake s hedging activities are dynamic 
mark to market positions under natural gas and oil derivative contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under hedging facility  our secured multi counterparty hedging facility allows us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our natural gas and oil derivatives by pledging natural gas and oil proved reserves

for the year ended december   chesapeake had net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion 
this compares to a net loss of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
during  natural gas and oil sales were billion compared to billion in and billion in in  chesapeake produced and sold tcfe of natural gas and oil at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in prices in resulted in a decrease in revenue of million and increased production resulted in a million increase  for a total increase in revenues of million excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas and oil derivatives 
the increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit

included in the realized price of natural gas are gains related to swaps that had an above market fixed price on the origination date 
we obtained these above market swaps by selling out year call options on a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production

our year over year growth rate of natural gas production was and our year over year growth rate of oil production was 
our percentage of revenue from oil in was of realized natural gas and oil revenue compared to in marketing  gathering and compression sales and operating expenses 
marketing  gathering and compression sales and operating expenses consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our midstream operations 
marketing  gathering and compression activities are performed by chesapeake substantially for owners in chesapeake operated wells 
chesapeake realized billion in marketing  gathering and compression sales in  with corresponding marketing  gathering and compression expenses of billion  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to sales of billion and billion  expenses of billion and billion  and margins before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
in  chesapeake realized an increase in marketing  gathering and compression sales and operating expenses primarily due to an increase in third party marketing  gathering and compression volumes 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenues  expenses and margin related to certain of our midstream assets that were contributed to our midstream joint venture on september  and subsequently deconsolidated on january  in  chesapeake realized an increase in marketing  gathering and compression net margin primarily due to an increase in third party marketing  gathering and compression volumes 
service operations revenue and operating expenses 
service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our drilling and oilfield trucking operations 
chesapeake recognized million in service operations revenue in with corresponding service operations expenses of million  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to revenue of million and million  expenses of million and million and a net margin before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
service operations margins have increased as service rates increased throughout the economic slowdown toward the end of and throughout caused decreased service rates and increased stacked rigs  resulting in much lower operating margins for when compared to and production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the per unit expense decreases in and were primarily the result of completing new high volume wells with lower per unit production costs

production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in the million increase in production taxes from to is due to an increase in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of per mcfe excluding gains or losses on derivatives  and a production increase of bcfe 
the decrease in was due to a decrease in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of per mcfe excluding gains or losses on derivatives 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas and oil prices are higher 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our natural gas and oil properties see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were  and per mcfe for  and  respectively 
the increase in is the result of the company s continued growth resulting in higher payroll and associated costs 
the decrease in was primarily the result of decreased spending related to media relations 
included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in restricted stock grants expense is based on the price of our common stock on the date of grant 
our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock 
employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four or five years 
our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years 
the discussion of stock based compensation in note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
in addition  we capitalize internal costs that can be identified with construction of certain of our property  plant and equipment 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development efforts and the construction of our property  plant and equipment 
natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of natural gas and oil properties was billion  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average rate from in to in is due primarily to reductions of our natural gas and oil full cost pool resulting from our divestitures in  and  impairments of our full cost pool in and as well as the addition of reserves through our drilling activities 

table of contents depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the average dd a rate per mcfe was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily due to certain of our midstream assets that were contributed to our midstream joint venture on september  and subsequently deconsolidated on january   offset by additional depreciation expense associated with the assets acquired over the past year 
property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over to years  gathering facilities are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to twenty years 
to the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as exploration or development costs 
impairment of natural gas and oil properties 
due to lower commodity prices in the second half of and throughout  we reported a non cash impairment charge on our natural gas and oil properties of billion in and billion in we account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting  which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a pre tax discount rate based on pricing and cost assumptions prescribed by the sec and the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges 
gains losses on sales of other property and equipment 
in  we recorded a million gain associated with sales of other property and equipment which consisted of a million gain on the sale of our springridge gas gathering system to our affiliate  chkm  and a net million loss related to various sales of other property and equipment  including the sale of pipe  gas gathering systems and other miscellaneous assets 
in  we recorded a million loss on the sale of two gathering systems 
there were nominal amounts of gains and losses on the sales of other property and equipment in other impairments 
in  we recorded a million impairment to natural gas gathering systems primarily related to the obsolescence of certain pipe inventory

in  we recorded a million impairment associated with certain of our midstream assets 
restructuring costs 
in  we recorded million of restructuring and relocation costs in our eastern division and certain other workforce reduction costs 
we reorganized our charleston  west virginia based eastern division from a regional corporate headquarters to a regional field office consistent with the business model we use elsewhere in the country 
as a result  we consolidated the management of our eastern division land  legal  accounting  information technology  geoscience and engineering departments into our corporate offices in oklahoma city 
the costs of the restructuring included termination benefits  consolidating or closing facilities and relocating employees 
the discussion of restructuring costs in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of these costs

during  we redeemed in whole for an aggregate redemption price of approximately billion  plus accrued interest  approximately million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due  million in principal amount of our senior notes due and approximately million in principal amount of our senior notes due associated with the redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in also during  we redeemed in whole for a redemption price of approximately million  plus accrued interest  all million in principal amount of our senior notes due we recognized a loss of million in associated with the redemptions 
additionally during  we completed tender offers to purchase for cash million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due following the completion of these tender offers  we redeemed the remaining million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due based on the redemption provisions in the indentures 
associated with these tender offers and redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in finally  in  we privately exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
through these transactions  we were able to retire this debt for common stock valued at approximately of the face value of the notes 
of the million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component of the notes and the remaining million was allocated to the equity conversion feature of the notes and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital

of the combined million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component and the remaining million was allocated to the equity conversion feature and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
the difference between the debt component and the value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a million gain 
this gain was partially offset by the write off of million in deferred charges associated with these exchanges 
also during  we repurchased million of our senior notes due in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a million 
table of contents loss  which consisted of a million premium and million of discounts  interest rate derivatives and deferred charges associated with the notes 
impairment of investments 
we recorded million  million and million of impairments of certain investments in  and  respectively 
each of our investees has been impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the freezing of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of and into and the economic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices leading to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees 
associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees  as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects  we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on certain investments 
other income 
other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income consisted of million of interest income and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income  million of expense related to consent solicitation fees and million of miscellaneous income 
income tax expense benefit 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of billion in compared to an income tax benefit of billion in and income tax expense of million in the entire income tax expense recorded in is deferred 
of the billion increase in  billion was the result of the increase in net income before taxes and million was the result of an increase in the effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be in loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was million in there were no losses on conversion exchange of preferred stock in and in general  the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further detail regarding these transactions 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil and changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of natural gas and oil derivative contracts are reflected in natural gas and oil sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging contracts are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative contracts are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as natural gas and oil cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as natural gas and oil sales 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is 
table of contents recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings as interest expense 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings as interest expense 
see hedging activities above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the fair value of our derivatives was a liability of million  a liability of million and an asset of billion  respectively 
natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in proved reserves and significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 

table of contents we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
for and  in calculating estimated future net revenues  current prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of natural gas and oil prices on the first day of each month within the month period ended 
costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
for  current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and natural gas and oil prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
under accounting guidance for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of the tax benefit  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if i natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  ii exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or iii we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of billion 
accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed 
tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties chief executive officer as of december   we had accrued accounts receivable from our chief executive officer  aubrey k 
mcclendon  of million representing joint interest billings from december which were invoiced and timely paid in january since chesapeake was founded in  mr 
mcclendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the founder well participation program fwpp and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in mr 
mcclendon s employment agreements 
under the fwpp  approved by our shareholders in june  mr 
mcclendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the fwpp  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr 
mcclendon as a result of his well participation 
on december   we entered into a new five year employment agreement with mr 
mcclendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him 
the total cost of the award to chesapeake was million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately million 
we are recognizing the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback described below  resulting in an expense of approximately million per year beginning in in addition to state and federal income tax withholding  similar employment taxes were imposed on mr 
mcclendon and withheld from the award 
the net incentive award of approximately million was fully applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by mr 
mcclendon or his affiliates under the fwpp 
the incentive award is subject to a clawback equal to any unvested portion of the award if during the initial five year term of the employment agreement  mr 
mcclendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company 
other related parties during  our owned affiliate  chesapeake midstream partners  lp chkm  provided natural gas gathering and treating services to us in the ordinary course of business

table of contents recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued the following standards which we reviewed to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
the guidance was effective upon issuance 
we adopted this guidance in the fasb also issued new guidance requiring additional disclosures about fair value measurements  adding a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of levels and measurements and gross presentation of activity within a level roll forward 
the guidance also clarified existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques 
we adopted this guidance in the current period 
adoption had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
required disclosures for the reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance and settlements of financial instruments valued with a level method are effective beginning on january   and we do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for discussion regarding fair value measurements 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are statements other than historical fact and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events

we urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
our general strategy for attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse natural gas and oil price changes is to hedge into strengthening natural gas and oil futures markets when prices allow us to generate high cash margins and when we view prices to be in the upper range of our predicted future price range 
information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions  industrial output levels and expectations  producer breakeven cost structures  liquefied natural gas import trends  natural gas and oil storage inventory levels  industry decline rates for base production and weather trends 
we use a wide range of derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives  including swaps and options puts or calls 
all of these are described in more detail below 
we typically use swaps for a large portion of the natural gas and oil volume we hedge 
swaps are used when the price level is acceptable 
we also sell calls  taking advantage of market volatility for a portion of our projected production volumes when the strike price levels and the premiums are attractive to us 
beginning in late and in  we have taken advantage of attractive strip prices in through and sold natural gas and oil call options to our counterparties in exchange for  and natural gas swaps with fixed prices above the then current market price 
this effectively allowed us to sell out year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to us in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time 
additionally  we sell call options when we would be satisfied to sell our production at the price being capped by the call strike or believe it to be more likely than not that the future natural gas or oil price will stay below the call strike price plus the premium we will receive 
we determine the volume we may potentially hedge by reviewing the company s estimated future production levels  which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production risked from new drilling 
production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels 
we do not hedge more volumes than we expect to produce  and if production estimates are lowered for future periods and hedges are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts  the hedges are reversed 
the actual fixed hedge price on our derivative instruments is derived from bidding and the reference nymex price  as reflected in current nymex trading 
the pricing dates of our derivative contracts follow nymex futures 
all of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price as stated in the contract and the floating price payment  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
we adjust our derivative positions in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part of an ongoing dynamic process 
we review our derivative positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices have fallen to levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position  we will mitigate such risk by either doing a cash settlement with our counterparty  restructuring the position  or by entering into a new swap that effectively reverses the current position a counter swap 
the factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original derivative position 
gains or losses related to closed positions will be realized in the month of related production based on the terms specified in the original contract 
in  we restructured many of our contracts that included knockout features as commodity prices decreased 
the knockouts were typically restructured into straight swaps or collars based on strip prices at the time of the restructure 
in the latter half of  we restructured a portion of our call options by lowering the strike price on call options sold for through and used the value to buy back call options for the same periods 
this increased our capacity to hedge additional volumes 

table of contents as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments consisted of the following swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity 
call options chesapeake sells call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty 
at the time of settlement  if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess and if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from either party 
put options chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a put option 
at the time of settlement  if the market price falls below the fixed price of the put option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such shortfall  and if the market price settles above the fixed price of the put option  no payment is due from either party 
knockout swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterparty s exposure to zero  in any given month  if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices 
basis protection swaps these instruments are arrangements that guarantee a price differential to nymex for natural gas from a specified delivery point 
for non appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which typically have negative differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which typically have positive differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract

table of contents we have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been mitigated under our secured hedging facility which requires counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
the table below reconciles the years ended december   and changes in fair value of our natural gas and oil derivatives

we settled contracts for billion  and we closed out contracts  which were in a liability position of million 
the realized gain or loss is recorded in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 
pursuant to accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  certain derivatives qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
following these provisions  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as the physical transactions being hedged occur 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is currently recognized in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains losses 
realized gains losses are comprised of settled contracts related to the production periods being reported 
unrealized gains losses are comprised of both temporary fluctuations in the mark to market values of non qualifying contracts and settled values of non qualifying derivatives related to future production periods
