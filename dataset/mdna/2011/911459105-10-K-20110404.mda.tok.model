capital standards 
the frb has risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are reported as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us government securities  to for assets with relatively higher credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital consists of common stock  retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most other intangible assets 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations o f the federal banking agencies 
since december   the frb and the fdic have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of  and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  the frb requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to average total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
it is improbable  however  that an institution with a leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio is 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the frb and fdic have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
a bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the fdic to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
as discussed above  the company is required to maintain certain levels of capital  as is the bank 
the regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the bank and the company as of december  are as follows requirement to be december  adequately capitalized well capitalized company bank tier leverage capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio prompt corrective action 
federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institutio n is subject to more restrictions 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated pa rties and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
premiums for deposit insurance 
the deposit insurance fund of the fdic insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of in a comprehensive manner revised the deposit insurance assessment system including the specific mandate that the fdic require the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets 
among other things with respect to the fdic insurance fund  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  raised the minimum designated reserve ratio ddr which the fdic must set each year  to percent from the former minimum of percent and removed the upper limit on the drr which was formerly capped at percent and therefore on the size of the fund  required that the fund reserve ratio reach percent by september  rather than percent by the end of  as formerly required  required that  in setting assessments  the fdic offset the effect of requiring that the reserve ratio reach percent by september  rather than percent by the end of on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than eliminated the requirement that the fdic provide dividends from the fund when the reserve ratio is between percent and percent  and continued the fdic s authority to declare dividends when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar year is at least percent  but granted the fdic sole discretion in determining whether to suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends 
in february  the fdic adopted conforming regulations mandated by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of that i modifies the definition of an institution s deposit insurance assessment base  ii changes the assessment rate adjustments and includes the unsecured debt adjustment  which lowers an institution assessment rate to recognize the buffer that long term unsecured and subordinated debt provides the fdic s deposit insurance fund  iii revises the deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the new assessment base and altered related adjustments  to implement the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dividend provisions  iv revises the large insured depository institution assessment system to differentiate for risk and determine accoun t losses from large institution failures that the fdic may incur  and to vi make technical and other changes to the fdic assessment rules 
the new rules are effective april   and the assessment rate would range between a minimum of basis points and a maximum of basis points 
in addition  the fdic board may increase or decrease such total base assessment rates up to a maximum increase of basis points or a fraction thereof or a maximum decrease of basis points or a fraction thereof after aggregating increases and decreases  as the board deems necessary 
in setting assessment rates  the board shall take into consideration the following estimated operating expenses of the deposit insurance fund  case resolution expenditures and income of the deposit insurance fund  the projected effects of assessments on the capital and earnings of the institutions paying assessments to the deposit insurance fund  the risk factors and other factors taken into account pursuant to usc b  and any other factors the board may deem appropriate 
the new rules would likely lower the overall assessment for smaller banks such as the bank 
however  due to the significant losses at failed banks and expected losses for banks that will fail  there are no assurances that fdic insurance fund assessments on the bank will not increase  and such increased assessments may materially adversely affect the profitability of the bank 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows

regulatory order from the california department of financial institutions during may of  the california department of financial institutions issued a written order the order pursuant to section of the california financial code to the bank as a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june the order issued by the california department of financial institutions is basically similar to the written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  except for certain additional requirements 
the additional requirements in the order for the bank are as follows develop and adopt a capital plan to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than and include in such capital plan a capital contingency plan for raising additional capital in the event of various contingencies  maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses and remedy any deficiency in the allowance for loan losses in the calendar quarter in which it is discovered  and not establish any new branches or other offices without the prior written consent of the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions  provide progress reports within days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the order to the california department of financial institutions detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the order and agreement and the results of such actions 
the bank is currently in full compliance with the requirements of the order including its deadlines 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company portfolio comprise the major portion of the company earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
impact of monetary policies 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
extensions of credit to insiders and transactions with affiliates 
the federal reserve act and frb regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an e xecutive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
consumer protection laws and regulations 
the banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations 
the company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the community reinvestment act the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination for cra compliance  as of september  the bank was rated satisfactory 
the equal credit opportunity act the ecoa generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the home mortgage disclosure act the hmda  in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods  requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the right to financial privacy act the rfpa imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers 
financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy  and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties 
finally  the real estate settlement procedures act the respa requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines  reimbursement and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with cra  ecoa  tila  fh act  hmda  rfpa and respa generally  the company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time  and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time 
the following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking 
the tax relief act was enacted on december  the tax relief act extends the bush era tax cuts for individual federal income tax rates through  including keeping the capital gains and dividend rates remain at or percent

it also allows the nonrefundable personal credits against the amt 
temporary gift and estate tax is also included in the tax relief act 
the gift and estate exemption was increased to million per person and million per couple and a top tax rate of percent for the estate  gift  and generation skipping transfer taxes for two years  through the exemption amount is also indexed beginning in the change is effective january   but allows an election to choose no estate tax and modified carryover basis for estat es arising on or after january  and before january  the law sets a million generation skipping transfer tax exemption and zero percent rate for the year

in addition  there are important changes to various sba loan administration programs to aid small businesses under the sba jobs act 
the sba jobs act provides for increasing maximum individual loan limits of sba loans  extending the higher government guarantee level and waiver of borrower fees for certain sba loans  and allowing alternative underwriting measures  specifically net worth and net income to allow more small businesses to participate in certain sba loans 
the dodd frank act  signed into law in july   will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act creates of a new interagency council  the financial system oversight council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the us economy posed by systemically significant  large financial companies  including bank holding companies and non bank financial companies 
the office of thrift supervision will be eliminated and its powers distributed among the office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal reserve board and the fdic 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository instituti ons that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also creates a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the dodd frank act also repeals the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for at least a year  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those provisions relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau  will increase the bank s operating and compliance costs as it is likely that the bank s existing regulatory agencies will adopt the same or similar consumer protections as the new consumer financial protection bureau will adopt 
the electronic funds transfer act the efta provides a basic framework for establishing the rights  liabilities  and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer eft systems 
the efta is implemented by the federal reserve s regulation e  which governs transfers initiated through atms  point of sale terminals  payroll cards  automated clearinghouse ach transactions  telephone bill payment plans  or remote banking services 
regulation e was amended in january to require consumers to opt in affirmatively consent to participation in the bank s overdraft service program for atm and one time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account 
notice of the opt in right must be prov ided to all existing and new customers who are consumers  and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained  before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts 
the new rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for atm and one time debit card transactions  as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program 
the new rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks  ach transactions  or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for atm and one time debit card transactions 
for customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for atm and one time debit card transactions  a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms  conditions  and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent  except for the overdraft service for atm and one time debit card transactions 
the mandatory compliance date for the regulation e amendments is july  provided that the bank may continue to assess overdraft service fees or charges on existing customer accounts prior to august   without obtaining the consumer s affirmative consent 
the bank s compliance with the new regulation e amendments may have an impact on the bank s revenue from overdraft service fees and non sufficient funds nsf charges

also in may  the credit card act of was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers 
the new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions  such as when a promotional rate ends  there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment 
interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year 
significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without days advance notice of the change 
the new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers such as utility companies and other creditors for existing credit card balances  though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if th ey give at least days advance notice of the change 
the new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts

credit card companies must stay at least  feet from college campuses if they are offering free pizza or other gifts to entice students to apply for credit cards 
the new law requires card issuers to give card account holders a reasonable amount of time to make payments on monthly bills 
that means payments would be due at least days after they are mailed or delivered 
credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments 
when consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first 
consumers must opt in to over limit fees 
those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits  thus avoiding over limit fees 
fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable 
finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges 
fees on credit cards cannot exceed percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card 
credit card issuers must disclose to cardholders the consequences of making only minimum payments each month  namely how long it would take to pay off the entire balance if users only made the minimum monthly payment

on october   the federal reserve board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the proposal  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governa nce  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
the proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the federal reserve board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large  complex banking organizations 
any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions 
in addition  the proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
similarly  on january   the fdic announced that it would seek public comment through advance notice of rule making on whether bank s with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged at higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged 
on september   the us treasury issued a policy statement entitled principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms 
the statement was developed in consultation with the us bank regulatory agencies and sets forth eight core principles intended to shape a new international capital accord 
six of the core principles relate directly to bank capital requirements 
the statement contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime that would involve substantial revisions to  if not replacement of  major parts of the basel i and basel ii and affect all regulated banking organizations and other systemically important institu tions 
the statement calls for higher and stronger capital requirements for bank and non bank financial firms that are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability due to their combination of size  leverage  interconnectedness and liquidity risk 
the statement suggested that changes to the regulatory capital framework be phased in over a period of several years with a recommended schedule providing for a comprehensive international agreement by december   with the implementation of reforms by december   although it does remain possible that us bank regulatory agencies could officially adopt  or informally implement  new capital standards at an earlier date 
following the issuance of the statement  on december   the basel committee issued a set of proposals the capital proposals that would significantly revise the definitions of tier capital and tier capital  with the most significant changes being to tier capital 
mos t notably  the capital proposals would disqualify certain structured capital instruments  such as trust preferred securities  from tier capital status 
the capital proposals would also re emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of tier capital by adding a minimum common equity to risk weighted assets ratio and requiring that goodwill  general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from tier capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of tier capital 
the capital proposals also leave open the possibility that the basel committee will recommend changes to the minimum tier capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively 
concurrently with the release of the capital proposals  the basel committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure the liquidity proposals 
the liquidity proposals have three key elements  including the implementation of i a  liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered  high quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors and that supervisors should use in monitoring the liquidity risk profiles of supervised entities 
in june  the administration proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms that  if enacted  may have significant effects on the financial services industry in the united states

item a 
risk factors there are risk factors that may affect the company s business and impact the results of operations  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
we are operating subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco and order issued by the california department of financial institutions 
on march   the company and the bank voluntarily entered into a written agreement agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  and on may  the bank consented to the issuance of a final order by the california department of financial institutions the order 
the order and agreement are substantially similar 
each establishes timeframes for the completion of remedial measures identified by the regulators as important to improve our financial soundness 
some of the specific provisions in the order and or agreement include us being required to strengthen board oversight of the bank s management and operations  strengthen credit risk management practices of the bank  strengthen asset quality at the bank by i not extending  renewing  or restructuring certain credits  and ii submitting to the federal reserve bank an acceptable written plan designed to improve the bank s position through repayment  amortization  liquidation  additional collateral  or other means on each loan or other asset in excess of million including other real estate owned that is past due as to principal or interest more than days  on the bank s problem loan list  or were adversely classified in the report of examination or subsequent report of examination  improve management of the bank s allowance for loan losses  maintain sufficient capital at the company and bank  submit a revised business plan and budget to the federal reserve bank for and subsequent calendar years that the bank is subject to the agreement to improve the bank s earnings and overall condition  not make certain distributions  dividends  and payments  specifically that i the company and bank agreeing not to declare or pay any dividends without the prior written approval of the federal reserve bank  ii the company not taking any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the bank without the prior written approval of the federal reserve bank  and iii the company and its nonbank subsidiaries not making any distributions of interest  principal  or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without the prior written approval of the federal reserve bank  not incur debt or redeem stock  specifically  that except with the prior written approval of the federal reserve bank  the company each agree not to incur  increase  or guarantee any debt or purchase or redeem any shares of its stock  correct violations of the laws by i the bank immediately taking all necessary steps to correct all violations of law and regulation cited in the report of examination  ii the board of the bank taking the necessary steps to ensure the bank s future compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  iii complying with the notice provisions of applicable federal banking law prior to appointing any new director or senior executive officer  or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior executive officer position  and iv complying with the restrictions on indemnification and severance payments of federal bank law and regulations  comply with the agreement by i appointing a compliance committee of the bank compliance committee within days of the date of the agreement to monitor and coordinate the bank s compliance with the provisions of the agreement  which compliance committee is composed of a majority of outside directors who are not executive officers or principal shareholders of the bank and which is to meet at least monthly and report its findings to the board of directors of the bank  and ii the company and bank within days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the agreement submitting to the federal reserve bank written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the agreement and the results of such actions  develop and adopt a capital plan for the california department of financial institutions to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than and include in such capital plan a capital contingency plan for raising additional capital in the event of various contingencies  maintain at the bank a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than  maintain at the bank an adequate allowance for loan losses and remedy any deficiency in the allowance for loan losses in the calendar quarter in which it is discovered  not establish any new branches or other offices of the bank without the prior written consent of the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions  and provide progress reports within days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the order to the california department of financial institutions detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the order and agreement and the results of such actions 
any material failure to comply with any provisions of the order or agreement  including the failure of the board of directors to provide adequate oversight of the management of the bank and company  could result in enforcement actions by our regulators  including  in some cases  the assessment of civil money penalties against us  enforcement of the agreements through court proceedings  or in the worse case  placing us into receivership with the fdic 
if the bank is placed into fdic receivership  we would be required to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment 
while we intend to take such actions as may be necessary to enable us to comply with the requirements of the order and agreement  there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply fully with their provisions  or to do so within the time frames required  that compliance with the order and agreement will not be more time consuming or more expensive than anticipated  that compliance with the order and agreement will enable us to resume profitable operations  or that efforts to comply with the order and agreement will not have adverse effects on our operations and financial condition 
in addition  the material failure to comply the provisions of the order or agreement relating to the company or bank s financial condition or results of operations may result in the weakening of the company s and bank s financial condition  losses  or improper financial reporting of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with the agreement s provisions as to restrictions on borrowing and growth through branching may restrict the ability of the bank to grow and may limit the amount of growth and potential future earnings of the bank 
also compliance with the agreement  s provisions may require the company and bank to incur higher expenses in connection with such compliance 
additional  if the company is not allowed by bank regulators to pay interest on the subordinated debentures of its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarters  there will be an event of default on the trust preferred securities  and the trustee of the indenture of the subordinated debentures may bring an action against the company for nonpayment 
we have determined that we have material weaknesses related to our internal control over financial reporting 
in connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended december   management identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to the allowance for loan losses and the completeness and accuracy of the provision for loan losses  as well as material weaknesses related to the valuation of oreo properties 
in response to the material weaknesses identified by the company  the company has taken certain remedial measures that the company believes will correct the design and operational effectiveness of such internal controls  however  we cannot guarantee that such remedial measures will actually correct the design and operational effectiveness of such internal controls and that in the future we will not discover additional material weaknesses in inter nal control over financial reporting 
difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could continue to adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in its markets 
financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market that have negatively impacted the credit performance of construction  commercial real estate loans  and residential mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
the company retains direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and it is affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse affect on the company s borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in its credit portfolio is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions 
the company also expects to face increased regulation and government oversight as a result of these downward trends 
this increased government action may increase the company s costs and limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
in addition  the company may be required to pay even higher fdic deposit insurance premiums than the recently increased level  because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions and other factors have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
a prolonged national economic recession or further deterioration of these conditions in the company s markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for credit losses and result in the following consequences increases in loan delinquencies  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures  decreases in demand for the company s products and services  which could adversely affect its liquidity position  and decreases in the value of the collateral securing the company s loans  especially real estate  which could reduce customers borrowing power 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult economic conditions on the company  its customers and the other financial institutions in its market 
as a result  the company may experience increases in foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 
the us treasury and the fdic have initiated programs to address economic stabilization  yet the efficacy of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system at large are uncertain 
liquidity risk could impair the company s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition 
liquidity is essential to the company s business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity 
the company s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
as a result of the march agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company  the company is required to submit to the federal reserve bank an acceptable plan to improve management of the bank s liquidity position and funds management practices 
the bank will be required to enhance the monitoring  measurement  and reporting of the bank s liquidity position to the board  while reducing the reliance on brokered and other wholesale funding sources  enhancing written contingency funding plans  and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet the company s contractual obligations 
failure to accomplish these requirements could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions  and could impair or severely damage the ongoing operations of the company 
the company could experience liquidity shortfalls if it were to dispose of brokered deposits pursuant to the march agreement and were not able to replace them with other funding sources  or was not able to reduce assets quickly enough to cover liquidity shortfalls 
the company s financial performance is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s operations are greatly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
deposit flows and the funding costs are influenced by interest rates of competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and by other factors affecting the availability of funds 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received from interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  management seeks to manage the balances of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintain appropriate maturity and repricing parameters for these assets and liabilities 
a mismatch between the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities in any time period may expose the company to interest rate risk 
generally  if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negative ly impacted during a declining rate environment 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment 
increases in the level of interest rates may reduce the overall level of loans originated by the company  and  thus  the amount of loan and commitment fees earned  as well as the market value of investment securities and other interest earning assets 
moreover  fluctuations in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investments  such as corporate securities and other investment vehicles which  because of the absence of federal deposit insurance  generally pay higher rates of return than depository institutions 
the continued deterioration of local economic conditions in the company s market area could hurt profitability 
the company s operations are located primarily in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties  and are concentrated in fresno county and surrounding areas 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
the local economy in the company s market areas rely heavily on agriculture  real estate  professional and business services  manufacturing  trade and tourism 
the significant economic downturn experienced in the sub prime lending and credit markets since the later part of  has negatively impacted the company s operations and financial condition  and may further worsen with prolonged or further deterioration of local and state wide economic conditions 
poor economic conditions could cause the company to incur additional losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in the loan portfolio 
concentrations in commercial and industrial loans  real estate secured commercial loans  and real estate construction loans  may expose the company to increased lending risks  especially in the event of a recession 
the company has significant concentrations in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans 
as of december    and of the company s loan portfolio was concentrated in these two categories  respectively 
in addition  the company has many commercial loans to businesses in the construction and real estate industry 
there has been significant volatility in real estate values in the company s market area in recent years  and an extended real estate recession affecting these market areas would likely reduce the security for many of the company s loans and adversely affect the ability of many of borrowers to repay loan balances due the company and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
therefore  the company s financial condition and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the real estate securing the company s loans 
if the company forecloses on collateral property  we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
the company has and may continue to foreclose on collateral property to protect its investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that the company  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of the company s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate  and as a result  the company may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect the company s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
the small to medium sized businesses that the company lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy  which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan to the company that could materially harm the company s operating results 
the company targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results 
any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small to medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan 
economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the company s market areas could cause the company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company faces strong competition  which may adversely affect its operating results 
in recent years  competition for bank customers  the source of deposits and loans for the company has greatly intensified 
this competition includes larger regional and national banks and other fdic insured depository institutions in many of the communities the company serves  finance companies  investment banking and brokerage firms  and insurance companies that offer bank like products  credit unions  which can offer highly competitive rates on loans and deposits because they receive tax advantages not available to commercial banks  and technology based financial institutions including large national and super regional banks offering on line deposit  bill payment  and mortgage loan application services 
some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured financial institutions 
as a result  these non bank competitors have certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various banking related services 
by virtue of their larger capital position  regional and national banks have substantially larger lending limits than the company  and can provide certain services to their customers which the company is not able to offer directly  such as trust and international services 
many of these larger banks also operate with greater economies of scale which result in lower operating costs than the company on a per unit basis 
other existing single or multi branch community banks  or new community bank start ups  have marketing strategies similar to united security bancshares 
these other community banks can open new branches in the communities the company serves and compete directly for customers who want the high level of service community banks offer 
other community banks also compete for the same management personnel and the same potential acquisition and merger candidates 
ultimately  competition can drive down the company s interest margins and reduce profitability  as well as make it more difficult for the company to achieve its growth objectives 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs 
in addition  the company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions  if any 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of its control of the company  and its financial performance 
the economic downturn and significantly increased levels of nonperforming assets at the company has placed additional strain on the company s capital position 
the company may experience additional loan losses and lower levels of net income which may require incr eased levels of capital in the future 
as a result of the march agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company  the company is required to submit to the federal reserve bank an acceptable plan to maintain sufficient capital at both the bank and the company to comply with current regulatory guidelines taking into account the current level of classified assets  concentrations of credit  current and projected assets growth  and projected retained earnings 
the company cannot be assured that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all given the current financial position of the company and the state of the overall economy 
any occurrence that may limit its access to the capital markets  such as failure to comply with the federal reserve bank regulatory agreement  a decline in the confidence of investors  depositors of the banks or counterparties participating in the capital markets  may adversely affect the company s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and  in turn  its liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  and may also result in additi onal regulatory enforcement actions that could impair or severely damage the ongoing operations of the company 
the company could experience loan losses  which exceed the overall allowance for loan losses 
the risk of credit losses on loans and leases varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  and  in the case of collateralized loans  the value and marketability of the collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions  and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and determinations about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans where their collectability is considered to be questionable 
as a result of the march agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company  the company is required to submit to the federal reserve bank an acceptable program to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses including a sound process for determining  documenting  and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  the bank was required to eliminate or charge off all assets classified as loss in the most recent examination by the federal reserve  a requirement which has been complied with 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately million representing of net outstanding loans 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  there can be no absolute assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses given the current level of classified loans 
in addition  if the company after implementing its new program to determine and maintain an adequate reserve for loan and lease losses  needs to increase its provision for loan and lease losses  such additional provision will result in an additional loss for the company 
although the company uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used or if negative developments occur with respect to non performing or performing loans 
if management s assumptions or conclusions prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses  or if company s regulatory agencies require an increase in the allowance for loan losses  the company s earnings  and potentially its capital  could be significantly and adversely impacted 
the company is subject to other than temporary impairment risk the company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of equity  debt securities and cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
the company considers various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
the values of securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will the values of securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
the company estimates its expected future cash flows from its various businesses and determines the carrying value of these businesses 
the company exercises judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
the company then compares the carrying value  including goodwill and other intangibles  to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
if the goodwill that the company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired  it could require charges to earnings  which would have a negative impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets the company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
the company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any such adjustments are reflected in the company s results of operations in the periods in which they become known 
at december   the company s goodwill totaled million after recognizing a goodwill impairment loss of million during the year ended december  given the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that the company s future evaluations of goodwill will not result in additional findings of impairment and related write downs  which may have a material adverse e ffect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the regulatory environment under which the company operates may have an adverse impact on the banking industry 
the company is subject to extensive regulatory supervision and oversight from both federal and state authorities 
regulatory oversight of the company is provided by the federal reserve bank frb and the california department of financial institutions dfi 
future legislation and government may adversely impact the company and the commercial banking industry in general 
future regulatory changes may also alter the structure and competitive relationship among financial institutions 
the company may be exposed to compliance risk resulting from violations or nonconformity with laws  rules  regulations  internal policies and procedures  or ethical standards set forth by regulatory authorities 
the company may also be subject to compliance risk in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of the company s customers may be uncertain or untested 
compliance risk exposes the company to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages  and the potential voiding of contracts 
compliance risk can result in diminished reputation  reduced franchise value  limited business opportunities  and reduced growth potential 
increase in fdic insurance premiums may negatively affect profitability 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic insures payment of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
in late  the fdic announced an increase in insurance premium rates of seven basis points  beginning with the first quarter of additional changes  beginning april   were to require riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment for the second quarter of of five basis points on each insured depository institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   which was collected on september  the company expensed  during the second quarter for this special assessment 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule to require all insured depository institutions including the bank to prepay three years of fdic assessments in the fourth quarter of  except in the event such prepayment is waived by the fdic 
although the three year prepayment assessment was waived for the bank by the fdic  insurance premiums paid quarterly have increased substantially during the later part of  and ma y increase in future periods 
in general  we are unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional failures of fdic insured institutions  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums 
the announced increases and any future increases in fdic insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
if the company lost a significant portion of its low cost core deposits  it would negatively impact profitability 
the company s profitability depends in part on its success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low cost deposits 
as of december   noninterest bearing checking accounts comprised of the company s deposit base  and interest bearing checking and money market accounts comprised an additional and  respectively 
the company considers these deposits to be core deposits 
if the company lost a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively impact its profitability and long term growth objectives 
while management generally does not believe these deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  the competition for these deposits in the company s market area is strong and if the company were to lose a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively a ffect business operations 
the company participated in the fdic s transaction account tag program  a voluntary program under which participating financial institutions could obtain unlimited fdic insurance coverage for all noninterest bearing transaction accounts without limitation  and coverage for all interest bearing accounts which pay or will never pay more than 
the tag program expired on december  however  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act provide unlimited fdic insurance for noninterest bearing transaction accounts in all banks effective on december  and continuing through december  if after december   the tag program was not continued  the company could loose some  or a substantial portion  of those deposits which would not otherwise be subject to fdic insurance cove rage 
the loss of noninterest bearing or low cost deposits could adversely impact the company s liquidity position and the company would need to seek higher cost funding sources which could impair the company financial position and results of operations 
as a result of the march regulatory agreement between the federal reserve and the company  the company will reduce its reliance on brokered deposits and other wholesale funding over the next two years to near peer levels 
reductions in brokered deposits may be difficult to replace with other types of deposit accounts

the company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
united security bancshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
the company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary  united security bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on common stock and interest on the company s junior subordinated debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that united security bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to united security bancshares 
also  united security bancshares right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
as a result of the written agreement with the federal reserve bank entered into march   the united secu rity bank is unable to pay dividends to united security bancshares  and united security bancshares is not able to pay dividends on common stock  or pay interest on its junior subordinated debt 
this could have a negative impact on the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
under regulatory restraints  the bank is currently precluded from paying dividends to the company and may be precluded from doing so into the foreseeable future 
we have deferred interest payments on our trust preferred securities which prevents us from paying dividends on our capital stock until those payments are brought current 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since the second quarter of and do not expect to resume cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
in order to preserve capital  at september  we deferred quarterly payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities beginning with the quarterly payment due october  as a result of the of the march agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company and the may order between the california department of financial institutions and the company  the company is currently prohibited from paying interest on its trust preferred securities  and is also prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock 
the te rms of the debentures related to the trust preferred securities permit us to defer payment of interest for up to consecutive quarters 
interest continues to accrue while interest payments are deferred 
under the terms of the trust preferred securities we are prohibited from paying cash dividends on our capital stock including common stock during the deferral period 
the holders of the company s junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the company s shareholders 
on july  the company issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by its subsidiary  united security bancshares capital trust ii 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in july the company conditionally guarantees payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the company s junior subordinated debentures are senior to holders of common stock 
as a result  the company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
effective september   the company elected to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no cash dividends may be paid to holde rs of common stock 
as a result of the march agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company  and the may order between the california department of financial institutions and the company  the company is currently prohibited from paying interest on its junior subordinated debentures

the agreement was a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june and is intended to improve the overall condition of the bank through  among other things  increased board oversight  formal plans to monitor and improve processes related to asset quality  liquidity  funds management  capital  and earnings  and the prohibition of certain actions that might reduce capital  including the distribution of dividends or the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the board of directors and management believe that as of the filing of the fourth quarter written response to the agreement  company is in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
for more information on the terms of the agreement see the regulatory matters section included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco during march was a result of a regulatory examination conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june the following issues related to the june examination led to the agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company that corrective action was required asset quality continued to deteriorate as adversely classified assets increased over four consecutive target and full scope examinations conducted from through the june exam 
the dollar volume of adversely classified assets increased by during the six months prior to the exam to million at the june examination 
below investment grade investment securities classified substandard at the previous examination totaling million increased to million at the june examination  representing of tier capital and reserves as of march  the classified investment securities are comprised of three private label residential mortgage backed securities that are below investment grade as graded by a national rating agency  were divided between million in substandard and  in loss 
the portion listed as loss represented the amount identified as other than temporary impairment otti and had been recognized as loss as of march  during the june examination  it was the opinion of the federal reserve bank that the bank methodology related to the allowance for loan and leases losses was flawed  leading the federal reserve bank to conclude that additional provisions were required to raise reserves to an appropriate level 
in addition  weaknesses in the alll policy were identified and needed to be addressed  which included improvements in documentation related to identification and analysis of loans under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 and more detailed justification for the qualitative factors used in the alll process 
during the six months ended june   several large lending relationships to developers in the san joaquin valley deteriorated significantly  requiring an additional million in alll 
in addition  during that period  the bank experienced increases in other problem loans or potentially problem loans including nonacc rual loans and special mention loans  and real estate valuations continued to decline 
regulators required an increase in the reserves as calculated by the federal reserve bank using a model they call the atlanta model 
the atlanta model calculated an estimated range of allowance for loan losses using a blend of national  regional  and local peer bank data 
the reserve calculated by the bank for june  under gaap included additions to alll required for increases in adversely classified and special mention loans experienced during the first half of  and although at the lower range of alll as estimated by the federal reserve  corresponded favorably with the federal reserves atlanta model 
the reserve adjustment required for the second quarter of totaled million bringing the alll level to million including reserve for unfunded commitments at june  the alll findings of the federal reserve bank included recommendations to better align actua l practices with the regulatory governing policy as well as to provide a more specific framework for analyzing  determining  and supporting the factors used in the alll methodology 
earnings performance declined as of june   due in large part to the additional million provision recorded for the second quarter million year to date resulting in a net loss for the company of million for the six months ended june  earnings for the period were also adversely impacted by a goodwill impairment loss of million pre tax and net  year to date pre tax impairment losses of  on the real estate mortgage backed securities  year to date pre tax operating expenses and impairment losses of million related to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
although the bank s tier leverage capital  tier risk based capital  and total risk based capital ratios remained above regulatory prompt corrective action guidelines of adequately capitalized banks at   and  respectively  at june   the federal reserve concluded that capital levels were less than adequate to support the bank high risk profile resulting primarily from the continued decline in asset quality 
at the june examination adversely classified assets were in excess of of tier capital and reserves 
the bank liquidity position had tightened since the last examination and was considered marginal at the june examination 
the bank tight liquidity position was the result of low levels of liquid assets  high percentage of investment securities pledged against borrowing lines  and higher levels of wholesale borrowings including million borrowed from the federal home loan bank line and million borrowed from the federal reserve bank discount window 
brokered deposits total million  of total deposits at june   and compared unfavorably with the peer group at 
the federal reserve concluded in the june examination that oversight by the board of directors and senior management was not adequate given the escalating risk profile of the bank activities although the severe economic downturn was a significant factor in the decline in asset quality  the board of directors and senior management were deemed responsible for implementing a business strategy which allowed concentrations in higher risk speculative residential construction lending 
the board of directors and senior management had taken measures to maintain asset quality  capital  earnings  and liquidity  but had had not responded in a timely manner to the rapidly changing real estate conditions 
as of march   the concentration in construction and land development loans represented high levels in relation to equity capital and reserves  although the exposures were declining over the prior few years 
for e xample  management increased the alll in the second quarter of  ordered new appraisals on property remargined collateral on loans  and was seeking sources for new equity capital 
in addition  several transactions to reduce or restructure problem assets were in process 
however  these actions had not resulted in material tangible improvements in the overall condition of the bank as of the june examination 
in addition  the june examination identified nine technical violations of regulation y subpart b that deal with the failure to obtain the prescribed appraisals or evaluations on loan extensions or renewals 
these violations of law were subsequently remedied 
the june examination indicated that risk management practices needed improvement 
management information systems needed to be redesigned and implemented to more accurately measure fundamental exposures  such as the ongoing credit risk posed by the residential construction and land development loan portfolio and the emerging liquidity risks 
the bank needed to continue its efforts to address and reduce the increasing volume of problem assets 
while the loan grading process showed improvement over the prior several examinations  the alll methodology was identified as flawed in the june examination 
while the board of directors and management made some progress to address the findings of the june examination  management needed to make further progress on improving several key areas to identify  measure  monitor  and control the exposures presented by credit  liquidity  market  operational  reputation  a nd legal risks 
the result of significant increases in nonperforming assets  both classified loans and oreo  during and the first half of increased the overall risk profile of the bank 
the increased risk profile of the bank included heightened concerns about the bank s use of brokered and other wholesale funding sources which had been used to fund loan growth and reduce the company s overall cost of interest bearing liabilities 
with loan growth funded materially from wholesale funding sources  liquidity risk increased  and higher levels of nonperforming assets increased risk to equity capital and potential volatility in earnings 
in addition  the federal reserve bank identified nine technical violations of regulation y subpart b that deal with the failure to obtain the prescribed appraisals or evaluations on loan extensions or ren ewals 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified a material weakness related to the allowance for loan losses and the completeness and accuracy of the provision for loan losses  as well as to the valuation of oreo properties for further discussion see item a controls and procedures 
as part of the agreement  the board of directors of the bank has appointed a compliance committee to monitor and coordinate the bank s compliance with the provisions of the agreement 
the compliance committee is comprised of the outside directors and they meet on a monthly basis 
among other things  the agreement required the bank to submit a number of written plans to the federal reserve bank within specified time frames 
the following is a list of written plans required to be submitted to the federal reserve bank 
plan to strengthen board oversight includes actions that the board of directors will take to improve the bank s condition  and maintain effective control and supervision over the bank s operations including credit risk management  liquidity  and earnings 
also includes the board s responsibility to monitor adherence to policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations  and lists information and reports that will enable the board to perform this oversight function 
plan to strengthen credit risk management practices includes the responsibility of board to establish appropriate risk tolerance guidelines and limits  timely and accurate identification and quantification of credit risk  strategies to minimize credit losses and reduce the level of problem assets  procedures for the ongoing review of the investment portfolio to evaluate other than temporary impairment  stress testing for commercial real estate loans and portfolio segments  and measures to reduce the levels of other real estate owned 
plan to improve adversely classified assets includes specific plans and strategies to improve the bank s asset position through repayment  amortization  liquidation  additional collateral  or other means on each loan  relationship  or other asset in excess of million including oreo  that are past due more than days as of the date of the written agreement

the bank currently has eleven banking branches  one construction lending office  and one financial services office  which provide banking and financial services in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
as a community oriented bank holding company  the company continues to seek ways to better meet its customers needs for financial services  and to expand its business opportunities in today ever changing financial services environment 
the company strategy is to be a better low cost provider of services to its customer base while enlarging its market area and corresponding customer base to further its ability to provide those services 
current trends affecting results of operations and financial position the company s overall operations are impacted by a number of factors  including not only interest rates and margin spreads  which impact results of operations  but also the composition of the company s balance sheet 
one of the primary strategic goals of the company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk  and to finance those assets with a low cost and stable source of funds 
liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth 
net interest income has declined over the past three years  totaling million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income between and was primarily the result of declines in the volume of interest earning assets which more than outweighed the increase in net interest margin during  while the decrease in net interest income between and was the result of both decreases in interest rates and declines in the average volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets decreased approximately million between and  and decreased million between and  as the company reduced the size of the balance sheet and sought to control the rising level of problem assets 
of the million decrease in average earning assets between and  million was in loans  and an additional million was in investment securities 
offsetting these decreases during were increases of million in federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in the federal reserve bank 
during the last three years  the company s cost of interest bearing liabilities has declined significantly as market rates of interest declined  with the average cost of interest bearing liabilities dropping from during  to during  and then to for the year ended december  during that three year period  the mix of average interest bearing liabilities changed  with interest bearing deposits increasing on average by million between the years ended december  and  and decreasing million on average between the years ended december and borrowings decreased million on average between the years ended december  and as the company sought to reduce its dependence on wholesale funding sources 
borrowings increased million between the years ended december  and the following table summarizes the year to date averages of the components of interest earning assets as a percentage of total interest earning assets  and the components of interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities ytd average ytd average ytd average loans investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks interest bearing deposits in frb federal funds sold total earning assets now accounts money market accounts savings accounts time deposits other borrowings trust preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities although residential real estate markets have shown signs of some improvement over the past twelve months  the severe decline in residential construction and median home prices that began in and persists to this time has impacted the company s operations during the past year with increased levels of nonperforming assets  increased expenses related to foreclosed properties  and decreased profit margins 
although the company continues its business development and expansion efforts throughout its market area  increased attention has been placed on reducing nonperforming assets and providing customers options to work through this difficult economic period 
options have included a combination of rate and term concessions  as well as forbearance agreements with borrowers 
while the level of restructured loans increased during an d to a balance of million at december   total nonperforming loans have actually decreased approximately million during the year ended december  fresno and kern counties have both been heavily impacted by the real estate downturn over the past three years 
prices have continued to decline slowly in these areas during even as they have stabilized or increased in other parts of california 
the fundamentals of the fresno real estate market are more stable than other hard hit areas of inland california 
both commercial and residential vacancy rates have increased during   and into  and remain significantly below the us average and show little sign of overbuilding  and population growth has been relatively steady and is generally not subject to the volatility experienced in more exurban areas 
however  single family home permits in the fresno area  which declined between and during both and  have contin ued to decline in and foreclosure and negative equity rates for residential mortgages remain among the top metro areas in the us employment and income growth in the fresno area remains very slow  and the unemployment in fresno county has risen from a little over in to almost in  and almost in  and increased slightly above that in a high concentration of middle class jobs in the fresno area are dependent on state and local governments which are under pressure due to tax and fee revenue in the near term 
the next several years will likely remain very challenging for fresno real estate  but the fundamentals suggest a strong recovery in commercial and residential development in the medium and long term 
kern county varies slightly from fresno county 
kern has performed slightly better in employment and income growth than fresno  but its real estate markets show greater signs of oversupply and stress from the foreclosure crisis over the past three years 
commercial and residential vacancy rates have risen sharply in the bakersfield area  and its foreclosure and negative equity rates are consistently in the top in the us business and residential vacancy rates during the second quarter of at approximately are now above the us average after being substantially below average two years ago 
the rate of population growth has fallen significantly from near per year to between and  but remains above the state average 
during  the value of commercial building p ermits has fallen faster than any other area of california  and single family homes also decline 
due to higher inventories and exposure to foreclosures  it is anticipated that kern county real estate will be slower to recover than fresno 
on the positive side  the bakersfield area continues to lead all inland california areas in job growth  and is enjoying the favorable economic climate for its oil industry which complements the agriculture industry in this area 
compared to most areas in california and the west  santa clara county has experienced a steep v shaped recession 
santa clara county has not been as heavily impacted by foreclosures and declines in construction  but experienced a sharp decline in and has rebounded well in santa clara county is one of the few areas with consistent job and income growth in based on the strength of its high tech manufacturing sector that has benefited from increasing business investment 
it is one of the few areas where unemployment rates are lower in than in real estate prices have followed a similar pattern  posting some of the highest gains in the us in after big declines in and foreclosure rates and negative equity rates are comparable to the rest of the us  but significantly lower than other areas in the west 
above average job and income growth and very low vacancy rates in both the commercial and residential market mean that santa clara county should fare relatively well in a troubled regional real estate market 
as a result of the economic downturn over the past three years  particularly in real estate market  the company has experienced declines in the loan portfolio 
the greatest decreases have been experienced in real estate construction and development loans and commercial and industrial loans  as the company has reduced its exposure to real estate markets which have been hard hit over the past three years 
loans decreased million between december  and december   and decreased million between december  and december  during these periods  real estate construction and development loans decreased million between december  and december   decreased million between december  and december   as real estate construction has declined significantly in the san joaqui n valley and california overall 
the company has not made any material additions to the real estate construction and development loan portfolio over the past several years as a result of the depressed real estate markets  and has focused its attention on monitoring existing construction loans in the portfolio 
real estate construction and development loans amounted to   and of the total loan portfolio at december    and additionally  commercial real estate loans a component of real estate mortgage loans amounted to   and  of the total loan portfolio at december     respectively 
residential mortgage loans are not generally a large part of the company s loan portfolio  but some residential mortgage loans have been made over the past several years to facilitate take out loans for construction borrowers when they were not able to obtain permanent financing elsewhere 
these loans are generally year amortizing loans with maturitie s of between three and five years 
in addition  the company purchased two real estate mortgage pools in the past which totaled million  and million at december  and  respectively 
these real estate mortgage pools were subsequently sold during the second quarter of residential mortgages totaled million or of the portfolio at december   million or of the portfolio at december   and million or of the portfolio at december  loan participations  both sold and purchased  have declined over the past three years as lending originations have slowed significantly and the loan participation market with it 
as a result  loan participations purchased have declined from million or of the portfolio at december   to million or of the portfolio at december   to million or of the portfolio at december  in addition  loan participations sold have declined from million or of the portfolio at december   to million or of the portfolio at december   to million or of the portfolio at december  with market rates of interest remaining at historically low levels for more than a year  the company continues to experience compressed net interest margins  although margins have increased during the year ended december  the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  with approximately of the loan portfolio in floating rate instruments at december   the effects of low market rates continue to impact loan yields 
the company has successfully sought to mitigate the low interest rate environment with loan floors included in new and renewed loans over the past year 
loans yielded during the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s cost of funds has continued to decline over the past year and is largely responsible for the increase in net interest margin experienced during the year ended december  the company s average cost of funds was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
wholesale borrowing and brokered deposit rates have remained low since late  resulting in overnight and short term borrowing rates of less than during much of the past year 
the company has benefited from the low interest rate environment  and continues to utilize short term borrowing lines through the federal home loan bank 
although the company does not intend to increase its current level of brokered deposits  and in fact as a result of the recent agreement with the federal reserve bank and order with the california department of financial institutions  will systematic ally reduce brokered deposit levels as they mature in the future  the million in brokered deposits at december  continues to provide the company with a low cost source of deposits 
the company will continue to utilize these funding sources when possible to maintain prudent liquidity levels  while seeking to increase core deposits when possible 
total noninterest income of million reported for the year ended december  decreased  or as compared to the year ended december  noninterest income continues to be driven by customer service fees  which totaled million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or over the million in customer service fees reported for the year ended december   and a decrease of  or over the million reported for the year ended december  the decline in customer service fees between and are primarily the result of decreases in atm fees between the two periods resulting from the loss of a contract during to provide multiple atm s in a single location 
customer service fees represented   and of total noninter est income for the years ended december    and  respectively 
other components of noninterest income have become more volatile during the past several years as many have been nonrecurring or non sustainable  including gains or losses on other real estate owned through foreclosure or other asset disposals as the company works to reduce problem assets 
other components of noninterest income recognized during the year ended december  included gains of  on the sale of million in two purchased real estate mortgage portfolios  fair value gains of  on the company s junior subordinated debt  as well as  from insurance proceeds on an insurance policy held as collateral on a previously charged off loan 
noninterest expense increased approximately million or between the years ended december  and december   and increased million or between the years ended december  and december  increases experienced during the year ended december  were primarily the result of both increases in oreo impairment charges  as well as increased fdic insurance assessments costs 
decreases in noninterest expense experienced during the year ended december  included decreases of million in impairment losses on goodwill  with impairment losses of million recognized during as compared to million recognized during effective september  and beginning with the quarterly interest payment due october   the company deferred interest payments on the company million of junior subordinated debentures relating to its trust preferred securities 
this was the result of regulatory restraints which have precluded the bank from paying dividends to the holding company 
the agreement with the federal reserve bank entered into during march specifically prohibits the company and the bank from making any payments on the junior subordinated debt without prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
the terms of the debentures and trust indentures allow for the company to defer interest payments for up to consecutive quarters without default or penalty 
during the period that the interest deferrals are elected  the company will continue to r ecord interest expense associated with the debentures 
upon the expiration of the deferral period  all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable 
under the terms of the debenture  the company is precluded from paying cash dividends to shareholders or repurchasing its stock during the deferral period 
the company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since the second quarter of and does not expect to resume cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
because the company has elected to defer the quarterly payments of interest on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the trust preferred securities as discussed above  the company is prohibited under the subordinated debenture agreement from paying cash dividends on its common stock during the deferral period 
in addition  pursuant to the agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank during march of  the company and the bank are precluded from paying cash dividends without prior consent of the federal reserve bank 
on march   june   september   and december   the company  s board of directors declared a one percent quarterly stock dividend on the company s outstanding common stock 
the company believes  given the current uncertainties in the economy and unprecedented declines in real estate valuations in our markets  it is prudent to retain capital in this environment  and better position the company for future growth opportunities 
based upon the number of outstanding common shares on the record date of april   july   october   and january   respectively  an additional    and  shares  respectively  were issued to shareholders 
for purposes of earnings per share calculations  the company s weighted average shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares used in the computation of earnings per share have been restated after giving retroactive effect to the stock dividends to shareholders for all periods presented 
the company has sought to maintain a strong  yet conservative balance sheet while continuing to reduce the level of nonperforming assets and improve liquidity during the year ended december  total assets decreased approximately million during the year ended december   with a decrease of million in loans  a decrease of million in investment securities  and million in goodwill 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the sale of two purchased real estate mortgage loan portfolios totaling million  recognizing a gain of  on the transaction 
the sale of the mortgage loan portfolios has provided additional liquidity and was part of the reason for the decrease in loans during the year en ded december  decreases of million in fhlb term borrowings between december  and december  were compounded by decreases of million in net deposits 
increases of million in now and money market accounts during the year ended december  were more than offset by decreases of million in time deposits as the company continued its efforts to reduce the level of brokered time deposits during average loans comprised approximately of overall average earning assets during the year ended december   as compared to and of average earning assets for the years ended december and  respectively 
nonperforming assets  which are primarily related to the real estate loan and property portfolio  remained high during the year ended december  as real estate markets continue to suffer from the mortgage crisis which began during mid nonaccrual loans totaling million at december   decreased  from the balance reported at december   and decreased million from the balance reported at december  in determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans  management monitors trends within specific geographical areas  loan to value ratios  appraisals  and other credit issues related to the specific loans 
valuations on these loans and the underlying collateral continued to deteriorate during much of and  resulting in increased charge offs and levels of impa ired loans 
impaired loans decreased million during the year ended december  to a balance of million at december   but increased million from the balance of million reported at december  other real estate owned through foreclosure decreased  between december  and december   but increased million from the balance of million reported at december  during the year ended december   write downs on  and sales of  other real estate owned through foreclosure more than offset the million in loans transferred to other real estate owned during the year 
as a result of these events  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased from at december  to at december the following table summarizes various nonperforming components of the loan portfolio  the related allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for credit losses for the periods shown 
in thousands december  december  december  provision for credit losses during period allowance as of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans as total loans restructured loans as total loans as the economy has declined along with asset valuations  increased emphasis has been placed on impairment analysis of both tangible and intangible assets on the balance sheet 
as of march   the company conducted annual impairment testing on the largest component of its outstanding balance of goodwill  that of the campbell operating unit resulting from the legacy merger during february in part  as a result of continued declines in interest rates and other economic factors within the industry  we could not conclude at march  that there was not a possibility of goodwill impairment under the current economic conditions 
during the second quarter of  the company utilized an independent valuation service to determine the aggregate fair value of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets o f the campbell operating unit in question to determine if the goodwill related to that operating unit was impaired  and if so  how much the impairment was 
management  with the assistance of the independent third party  concluded that there was impairment of the goodwill related to the campbell operating unit  and as a result the company recognized an impairment loss of million or per share pre tax and after tax for the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  the company recognized an impairment loss of million or per share pre tax and after tax for the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  management continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of further deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the allowance for loan losses required to cover identified losses in the loan portfolio 
as the real estate market declined through  and that accelerated throughout much of  the level of problem assets increased  and the estimated real estate values on many of those assets decreased resulting in increased charge offs or write downs of those assets 
greater focus has been placed on monitoring and reducing the level of problem assets  while working with borrowers to find more options  including loan restructures  to work through these difficult economic times 
as a result of these efforts  restructured loans increased from a single loan totaling  at december  to approximately loans totaling million at december  and then decreasing to loans totaling million at december  provisions made to the allowance for credit losses  totaled million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the provisions made to the allowance for credit losses  totaling million during the first quarter of   during the second quarter of  million made during the third quarter of  and million made during the fourth quarter of  provided a level in the allowance for credit losses that is deemed adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
net loan and lease charge offs during the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company charged off approximately loans dur ing the year ended december   compared to loans during the year ended december   and loans during year ended december  loan and lease charge offs totaling million during the year ended december  included  during the quarter ended march   million during the quarter ended june    during the quarter ended september   and an additional million during the fourth quarter of the percentage charge offs to average loans were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
deposits decreased by million during the year ended december   with increases experienced in now  money market  and savings accounts  which were more than offset by decreases of million in time deposits during decreases in time deposits experienced during the year ended december  were primarily the result of decreases in brokered wholesale deposits  as the company continues to reduce its reliance on brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources  while enhancing liquidity 
brokered deposits have provided the company a relatively inexpensive funding source over the past several years totaling million or of total deposits at december   as compared to million or of total deposits at december   and million or of total deposits at december  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources were used to some degree to fund loan growth in and  but the current state of the economy and the financial condition of the company have made it increasingly important to continue to develop core deposits and reduce the company s dependence on brokered and other wholesale funding sources  including lines of credit with the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
the company increased its efforts early in to develop core deposit growth with emplo yee training throughout the entire organization and a deposit gathering program that incented employees to bring in new deposits from our local market area and establish more extensive relationships with our customers 
the company continues its deposit gathering program and committed additional resources to its efforts during including two full time employees dedicated to business development 
as part of its liquidity position improvement plan resulting from the formal agreement with the federal reserve bank issued in march  the company will reduce its reliance on brokered deposits over the next two years to levels more comparable with peers  which is currently about of total deposits 
the company will seek to replace maturing brokered deposits with core deposits  but may also control loan growth to help achieve that objective 
while the company still has a higher percentage of brokered deposits than peers at december   efforts to restructure the balance sheet through reducing the level of total assets  and specifically real estate loans  are proving successful 
total wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits decreased from million at december  to million at december   representing a decrease of million during  and the company went from being a net purchaser of overnight funds at december   with million in federal funds purchased  to a net seller of overnight funds with million in federal funds sold at december  total wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits decreased an additional million during the year ended december  to a balance of million at december although balances have declined during  the company will continue to utilize overnight borrowings and other term credit lines as deemed prudent  with borrowings totaling million at december  as compared to million at december  the average rate of those term borrowings was at december   as compared to at december  although the company continues to realize significant interest expense reductions by utilizing overnight and term borrowings lines  the use of such lines are monitored closely to ensure sound balance sheet management in light of the current economic and credit environment 
the cost of the company s subordinated debentures issued by usb capital trust ii has remained low as market rates have actually declined during most of with pricing at month libor plus basis points  the effective cost of the subordinated debt was and at december  and december   respectively 
pursuant to fair value accounting guidance  the company has recorded  in pretax fair value gains on its junior subordinated debt during the year ended december   bringing the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt to million at december  the company continues to emphasize relationship banking and core deposit growth  and has focused greater attention on its market area of fresno  madera  and kern counties  as well as campbell  in santa clara county 
the san joaquin valley and other california markets continue to exhibit weak demand for construction lending and commercial lending from small and medium size businesses  as commercial and residential real estate markets declined during much of  and  and have continued to do so in although we saw some improvement during  the past year has presented significant challenges for the banking industry with tightening credit markets  weakening real estate markets  and increased loan losses adversely affecting the banking industry and the company 
the company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area 
balance sheet management  enhancing revenue sources  and maintaining market share will be of primary importance during and beyond 
the banking industry is currently experiencing continued pressure on net margins as well as asset quality resulting from conditions in the real estate market  and weak credit markets 
during march  the company and the bank entered into a regulatory agreement with the federal reserve bank which  among other things  requires improvements in the overall condition of the company and the bank 
as a result  market rates of interest  asset quality  as well as regulatory oversight will continue be an important factor in the company s ongoing strategic planning process 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally r eported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated using the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses  other real estate owned through foreclosure  impairment of collateralized mortgage obligations and other investment securities  and fair value estimates on junior subordinated debt  valuat ion for deferred income taxes  and goodwill  to be accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amou nt of the allowance for credit losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
the determination of fair value is generally based upon pre approved  external appraisals 
as real estate markets declined over the past three years and essentially became illiquid in many areas  management was required to use additional judgment in determining the factors associated with fair value of the real estate  including the term over which the properties could be disposed in an orderly liquidation 
this became necessary as many appraisals were based upon comparable sales which were deeply discounted forced liquidations or bulk sales ca used by the severity of the housing crises 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates  and as such  is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
impairment of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
securities classified as afs or held to maturity htm are subject to review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in april  the fasb updated the accounting standards for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the standard amends existing guidance on other than temporary impairments for debt securities and requires that the credit portion of other than temporary im pairments be recorded in earnings and the noncredit portion of losses be recorded in other comprehensive income loss when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis 
the company adopted the standard during the first quarter of factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  whether the decline is related to a credit event or to a change in interest rate  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
at december   the company considered three of its investment securities other than temporarily impaired 
the three private label collateralized mortgage obligations residential mortgage obligations have an amortized cost of million and carrying value of million 
impairment analysis on these three residential mortgage obligations was performed utilizing the services of a third party investment broker specializing in private label cmo s  and was based upon estimated cash flows 
estimated cash flows were based upon assumptions of future prepayments and default rates  and thus may be subject to revision as events change in the future 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pre tax losses totaling million related to the credit portion of the other than temporary impairment in earnings 
the remaining million impairment on the three residential mortgage obligations is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income at december  fair value effective january   the company adopted fair value option accounting standards choosing to apply the standards to its junior subordinated debt 
the company concurrently adopted the accounting standards related to fair value measurements 
the accounting standards related to fair value measurements defines how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued  and requires expanded disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
the fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available a ctive quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments infrequently traded or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
determining fair values under the accounting standards may include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace 
for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded fair value gains related to its junior subordinated debt totaling  and million  respectively 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments carried at fair value 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
the acquisition of taft national bank during april gave rise to goodwill totaling approximately million  and the acquisition of legacy bank during february resulted in goodwill of approximately million 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicativ e of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually using an internal discounted cash flow model 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized goodwill impairment of million  and million  respectively  on the goodwill associated with the legacy acquisition 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
on january   the company adopted the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the accounting standards  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be re viewed by the applicable taxing authority 
the company reviewed its various tax positions  including its ongoing reit case with the california franchise tax board ftb  as of january  adoption date  and then again each subsequent quarter during in light of the adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the bank  with guidance from advisors believes the case related to consent dividends taken by the bank s reit during has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely as defined that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january   the company recorded a reduction of  to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes to recognize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest 
during the years ended december   and  the company increased the unrecognized tax liability by an additional   and  respectively  in interest for the period  bringing the total recorded tax liability to   and  at december   december  and december   respectively 
it is the company s policy to recognize interest and penalties under fin as a component of income tax expense 
pursuant to the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes  the company will continue to re evaluate existing tax positions  as well as new positions as they arise 
if the company determines in the future that its tax positions are not more likely than not to be sustained as defined by taxing authorities  the company may need to recognize additional tax liabilities 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis  unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated 
pursuant to accounting standards related to revenue recognition  nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method 
other credit related fees  such as standby letter of credit fees  loan placement fees and annual credit card fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed 
for loans placed on nonaccrual status  the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management discretion based upon management assessment of collectibility  and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss of million or per share diluted compared to a net loss of million or per share diluted for the year ended december   and net income of million or per share diluted for the year ended december  net losses decreased  between december  and december  as the result of decreases provisions for credit losses taken during the year  which were partially offset by increases in other oreo impairment losses and fdic insurance expenses 
net income decreased million between december  and december  as the result of increased provisions for credit losses taken during the year  combined with declines in the volume of  and yields on earning assets  as well as increases in other impairment losses and oreo related expenses

the company s return on average equity was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the same twelve month periods of and  respectively 
as with variances in net income  changes in the return on average assets and average equity experienced by the company during and were primarily the result of fluctuations in loan loss provisions taken during the past three years  as well as changes in impairment losses and oreo related expenses 
net interest income net interest income  the most significant component of earnings  is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets consist primarily of loans  and to a lesser extent  investments in securities issued by federal  state and local authorities  and corporations  as well as interest bearing deposits and overnight funds with other financial institutions 
these earning assets are funded by a combination of interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities  primarily customer deposits and short term and long term borrowings 
net interest income before provision for credit losses totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of  or between the years ended december  and  as compared to a decrease of million or between and the decrease in net interest income between and  as well as between and  is primarily the result of decreased volumes of  and yields earned  on interest earning assets  which more than offset the decreased yields on interest bearing liabilities 
significant declines in the company s cost of funds helped to mitigate declines in net interest income and actually enhanced the net margin between the three annual per iods

total interest expense decreased approximately million  or between the years ended december  and  and is attributable to significant declines in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
between those two periods  average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million  and the average rates paid on these liabilities decreased by basis points 
average rates decreased in all interest bearing liabilities except junior subordinated debentures  and lower cost deposits including now accounts increased while higher cost deposits including time deposits decreased on average between the two annual periods 
total interest income decreased approximately million or between the years ended december  and  and was attributable to a decrease in yields on those earning assets  and to a lesser degree  earning asset volume 
earning asset decline was mostly in loans  with smaller declines in investments and interest bearing deposits in other banks 
total interest expense decreased approximately million between the years ended december  and as a result of significant decreases in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during  combined with decreases in the volumes of those interest bearing liabilities 
deposit rates continued to decline throughout much of as the federal reserve lengthened the anticipated duration of the low interest rate cycle in its efforts to resolve the severe economic downturn 
between the years ended december  and december   rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased in all categories  and on average decreased to almost half of what they had been during the year ended december  during  the company benefited as it utilized lower cost funding sources including overnight and short term borrowings  as well as brokered and other wholesale time deposits  which provided funding rates of less then during a significant portion of the year 
provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses and the amount added to the allowance for credit losses is determined on the basis of management continuous credit review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  current and future economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
such factors consider the allowance for credit losses to be adequate when it covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on the condition of the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december  the provision to the allowance for credit losses amounted to million as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provisions to the allowance for credit losses during included large provisions during the fourth quarters of the year as additional problem loans and further deterioration in existing problem loans were identified during the fourth quarter of the company s review of adequacy of the allowance for loans losses during the fourth quarter included reassessments of the economic improvements seen during the first half of the year which appeared to slow or stall during the third and fourth quarters of due in part to the prolonged nature of the economic downturn 
the company has determined in working with its bank regulators that many of its loans required a more adverse classification and a greater provision for loan losses than had been taken in prior comparable periods 
during  increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses included large provisions during the second and fourth quarters of the year as prolonged weakness in the economy  and specifically the residential housing market  required the company to become even more proactive in its assessment of problem loans 
provisions of million and million were made in the second and fourth quarters of increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses during  including provisions of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  were the result of higher levels of nonperforming loans during the year  and general deterioration in the housing and credit markets which began during the later part of  and continued throughout the amount provided to the allowance for credit losses during brought the allowance to of net outstanding loan balances at december   as compared to of net outstanding loan balances at december   and at december  noninterest income the following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated and the net changes between those years years ended december  increase decrease during year in thousands customer service fees increase in cash surrender value of boli gain loss on disposition of securities loss gain on sale of oreo gain on sale of assets gain on sale of loans proceeds from life insurance gain loss on swap ineffectiveness gain on fair value option of financial liabilities loss gain on sale of fixed assets shared appreciation income other total noninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services that are provided to the company s banking customers and  to a lesser extent  gains on sales of company assets and other miscellaneous income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to the previous year  and decreased million or when compared to the year ended december  customer service fees continue to provide a substantial part of noninterest income over the three years presented  representing   and of total noninterest income for the years ended december    and  respectively 
customer service fees decreased  between the years ended december  and december   and decreased  between the years ended december and december  much of the decrease in customer service fees between and is attributable to decreases in atm fee income 
during the year ended december   the company realized gains on the sale of loans totaling  as the result of the sale of two million purchase real estate mortgage portfolios  as well as  from insurance proceeds on an insurance policy held as collateral on a previously charged off loan 
additionally  the company also saw reductions of  in losses on the disposition of oreo properties during the year ended december  as compared to the previous year 
decreases in noninterest income were experienced primarily in two categories during fair value gains on the company s junior subordinated debt totaled  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  from the gains recognized during in addition  during the year ended december   the company recognized gains of  on the sale of a large inventory of agricultural equipment that had been foreclosed upon during the years 
the gains were not again realized during decreases in noninterest income were experienced in all but two categories during  with decreases experienced in customer service fees  gains in oreo sales  and shared appreciation income 
increases were experienced in gains on sale of assets as the company disposed of a large inventory of agricultural equipment that had been foreclosed upon during the year 
the decrease of  in other noninterest income experienced during includes a decrease of approximately  on oreo rental income  an income decline which the company does not expect to see change in the future 
the loss of  realized during on the disposition of investment securities was the result of the sale of a million mutual fund that was disposed of for liquidity purposes 
the company has experienced decreases in gains realized from the sale of other real estate owned through foreclosure and  actually realized net pre tax losses of  during as compared to net pre tax gains of  for the year ended december  during  the company accelerated the process of disposing of properties when economically possible rather than continue to hold them and incur ongoing carrying costs to maintain the properties 
additionally  decreases of approximately  were experienced in revenue generated by the company s financial services department between the years ended december  and december  shared appreciation income has decreased over the three years presented  with decreases of  between and  as compared to decreases of  between and shared appreciation income results from agreements between the company and the borrower on certain construction loans where the company agrees to receive interest on the loan at maturity rather than monthly and the borrower agrees to share in the profits of the project 
the profit is determined by the appraised value of the completed project and subsequent refinancing or sale of the project 
due to the difficulty in calculating future values  shared appreciation income is recognized when received 
the company has not participated in a significant number of shared appreciation projects in the past  and as a result of the economic deterioration in the real estat e markets over the past several years  we anticipate little or no shared appreciation income in the future 
noninterest expense the following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended december   and of of of average average average earning earning earning dollars in thousands amount assets amount assets amount assets salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense data processing professional fees fdic dfi assessments directors fees amortization of intangibles correspondent bank service charges writedown on investment impairment loss on oreo impairment loss on intangible assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on investment securities loss on lease assets held for sale loss on ca tax credit partnership oreo expense other total noninterest expense  excluding provision for credit losses and income tax expense  totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures represent an increase of million or between the years ended december  and and an increase of million or between the years ended december  and as a percentage of average earning assets  total noninterest expense has increased over the past three years primarily as the result of increases in impairment losses on oreo  goodwill and other assets held by the company  increases in professional fees related to problem assets and foreclosed properties  as well as increases in fdic insurance assessments 
noninterest expense amounted to of average earning assets for the year ended december  as compared to at december  and for the year ended december  increases in noninterest expense between the years ended december  and december  include impairment losses of million on oreo  other than temporary impairment losses of million on investment securities  and impairment losses of million on goodwill 
the amount expensed as other than temporary impairment losses on the investment securities represents the identified credit related portion of the impairment 
with the prolonged economic downturn  impairment loss continued as the values on many assets declined 
impairment losses on oreo properties are also a function of an increase in the volume of oreo acquired during the last several years  which is also reflected in oreo expense of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recognized a write down on an equity investment in bank stock totaling  as a result of continued deterioration in the economic condition of the company  reflected in a stock price that continued to decline over later half of the year 
fdic insurance assessments increased million during reflecting both the financial condition of the bank and a general increase in insurance assessment rates within the industry 
the net increase in noninterest expense between the years ended december  and is in large part the result of million in goodwill impairment losses taken during second quarter of other changes in noninterest expense are comprised of reductions in salaries and bonus incentives of nearly million  and reductions in occupancy and data processing costs of  which were more than offset by increases in oreo impairment and overhead costs  legal fees  fdic insurance assessments  and other expenses associated with nonperforming and foreclosed loans  as well as changes in the components of other impairment losses taken on various assets of the company 
during the year ended december   the company recognized  in impairment losses  during the first quarter   during the sec ond quarter   during the third quarter  and  during the fourth quarter of on three of its residential collateralized mortgage obligations which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired as the economy has declined between and  the company streamlined certain departments to more effectively control salary and employee benefit costs where the levels of business are lower than they have been historically 
the increase of  in other noninterest expense between the years ended december  and is primarily the result of a legal settlement totaling  for a disputed atm servicing contract with a third party servicer 
during the years ended december    and  the company recognized stock based compensation expense of  less than per share basic and diluted   less than per share basic and diluted  and  per share basic and diluted  respectively 
this expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits 
under the current pool of stock options  the company expects stock based compensation expense to be about  per quarter for  about  per quarter for  and decline after that through if new stock options are issued  or existing options fail to vest due  for example  to forfeiture  actual stock based compensation expense in future periods will change 
income taxes the company s income tax expense is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income reported for tax purposes  as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the company s pretax income or loss shown in the statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as pretax income or loss amounts become smaller  the impact of these differences become more significant and are reflected as variances in the company s effective tax rate for the periods presented 
in general  the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the company s statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company reviews its current tax positions at least quarterly based accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes which includes the criteria that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity s financial statements 
under the income tax guidelines  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority 
on december  the california franchise tax board ftb announced certain tax transactions related to real estate investment trusts reits and regulated investment companies rics will be disallowed pursuant to senate bill and assembly bill  which were signed into law in the th quarter of as a result  the company reversed related net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of and has taken no related tax benefits since that time 
the company continues to review the information available from the ftb and its financial advisors and believes that the company position has merit 
the company will pursue its tax claims and defend its use of these entities and transactions 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome 
pursuant to the guidance  the company reviewed its reit tax position as of january  adoption date of the new guidance  and then has again reviewed its position each subsequent quarter since adoption 
the bank  with guidance from advisors  believes that the case has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january  the company recorded an adjustment of million to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of the new guidance related to uncertainty in income taxes to recog nize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest

the bank s loan portfolio is generally comprised of short term or floating rate loans and is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in market rates of interest 
for the year ended december   the average yield on loans was  representing a decrease of basis points when compared to the year ended december  and was a result of continued loan pricing pressures as market rates of interest remained at historical lows 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   representing a decrease of basis points when compared to the year ended december  and was a result of a significant decrease in market rates of interest during the average loan yield for was also impacted by the reversal of approximately million in interest on nonaccrual loans  reducing the average loan yield by basis points for the year ended december  at december   and  approximately  and of the bank loan portfolio consisted of floating rate instruments  with the majority of those tied to the prime rate

in addition  one mutual fund with a carrying cost of million was sold during the fourth quarter of to provide additional liquidity 
investment securities increased million between december and december  as us government agencies and municipal bonds were either paid down or matured  and additional funds from maturing loans were utilized to purchase additional investment securities or interest bearing deposits in other banks 
securities that have been temporarily impaired less than months at december  are comprised of a single us government agency security with a weighted average life of years 
as of december   there were three residential mortgage obligations with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
at december   the decline in market value for all but the three residential mortgage obligations see below is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality 
because the company does not have the intent to sell these impaired securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  at december   the company had three non agency residential mortgage obligations which have been impaired more than twelve months 
all three residential mortgage obligations were rated less than high credit quality at december  the residential mortgage obligations had a market value of million and unrealized losses of approximately million at december  the company evaluated these three residential mortgage obligations for otti by comparing the present value of expected cash flows to previous estimates to determine whether there had been adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter 
the otti evaluation was conducted utilizing the services of a third party specialist and consultant in mbs and cmo products 
the cash flow assumptions used in the evaluation included a number of factors including changes in delinquency rates  anticipated prepayment speeds  loan to value ratios  changes in agency ratings  and market prices 
as a result of the impairment evaluation  the company determined that there had been adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter for two of the three residential mortgage obligations reviewed  and concluded that these three investments were other than temporarily impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  the two residential mortgage obligations had other than temporary impairment losses of million  of which  was recorded as expense and million was recorded in other comprehensive loss 
on a year to date basis  the three residential mortgage obligations had other than temporary impairment losses of million  of which million was recorded as expense and million was recorded in other comprehensive loss

as of december   there were three residential mortgage obligations  and one other investment security with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
at december   the decline in market value for all but three see below of the impaired securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality 
because the company does not have the intent to sell these impaired securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not c onsider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following summarizes temporarily impaired investment securities at december  less than months months or more total in thousands fair value fair value fair value carrying unrealized carrying unrealized carrying unrealized securities available for sale amount losses amount losses amount losses us government agencies us government agency collateral mortgage obligations residential mortgage obligations obligations of state and political subdivisions other investment securities total impaired securities securities that have been temporarily impaired less than months at december  are comprised of three residential mortgage obligations and one collateralized mortgage obligation with a weighted average life of years  and seven us agency bonds with a weighted average life of years 
as of december   there were two other investment securities with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
the unrealized losses are due in most part to interest rate changes  as well as credit downgrades in some of the portfolio including three collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has the ability and intent to hold all investment securities with identified impairments resulting from interest rate changes and credit downgrades to the earlier of the forecaste d recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security 
the company believes that credit downgrades on securities within the portfolio are a result of the severity of the current economic downturn and does not believe the downgrades will result in permanent impairment of those securities

deposits the bank attracts commercial deposits primarily from local businesses and professionals  as well as retail checking accounts  savings accounts and time deposits 
total deposits decreased million or during the year to a balance of million at december  and decreased million or between december  and december  core deposits  consisting of all deposits other than time deposits of  or more and brokered deposits  continue to provide the foundation for the bank principal sources of funding and liquidity

the company has a written plan  approved by the federal reserve bank  to improve its liquidity position which includes a timetable to reduce the bank s reliance on brokered deposits and other wholesale funding  and specific liquidity targets and parameters to meet contractual obligations and unanticipated demands 
under the plan  the company will systematically reduce the level of brokered deposits to peer levels as percentage of total deposits over a period of approximately two years 
this will be achieved by letting some or all of the maturing brokered deposits run off as needed to achieve planned reductions in brokered deposits at the end of each quarter over th e two year period 
during the year ended december   decreases were experienced primarily in time deposits  as brokered time deposits were allowed to runoff as part of the company s plan to reduce brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
while total time deposits decreased million or during the year ended december   brokered deposits  a component of total time deposits  decreased million or during the year 
now and money market accounts increased million or while savings accounts increased million or during the year ended december  pricing of brokered time deposits and other wholesale deposits have remained low over the past two years and have provided a viable alternate to borrowings from the federal reserve or the fhlb 
the company believes this rate st ructure will eventually turn  and wholesale funding sources  both deposits and borrowings  will again become expensive relative to other core deposits in the marketplace 
although the company will continue to use pricing strategies to control the overall level of time deposits and other borrowings as part of its balance sheet and liquidity planning process  the march agreement with the federal reserve bank requires reductions in brokered deposits  which places increased emphasis on core deposits as part of the company s long term relationship banking strategy 
as a result  core deposits  including now and money market accounts  and savings accounts  as well as noninterest bearing checking accounts  continue to provide the company s primary funding source 
during the year ended december   increases were experienced in interest bearing checking accounts and time deposits of  or more  while other deposit categories experienced small decreases 
time deposits of  or more increased million or during the year ended december   of which million of the increase is attributable to increases in brokered deposits 
the company increased brokered deposits during as part of its liquidity strategy to reduce dependence on overnight and term borrowings from the federal reserve and fhlb 
although pricing on borrowing remained attractive during  access to credit lines became more vulnerable as risk profiles of most banks  including the company  increased in the declining economic environment 
increases were also experienced in now and money market acc ounts which increased million or during the year ended december  the company deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits

short term borrowings the company has the ability to obtain borrowed funds consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds 
the company has established collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit with several correspondent banks  as well as a securities dealer  for the purpose of obtaining borrowed funds as needed 
the company may continue to borrow funds in the future as part of its asset liability strategy  and may use these funds to acquire certain other assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes and to better utilize the capital resources of the bank 
federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are general ly unsecured 
repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of us government agencies  and generally have maturities of one to six months  but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances are collateralized by the company s investment in fhlb stock  securities  and certain qualifying mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco  which would be collateralized by certain pledged loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the lines of credit are subject to periodic review of the company s financial statements by the grantors of the credit lines 
lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time if the grantors feel there are adverse trends in the company s financial position 
the company had collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit aggregating million and million  as well as fhlb lines of credit totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had total outstanding balances of million drawn against its fhlb line of credit

implicit in lending activities is the fact that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time  depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company follows  in accordance with gaap  the guidelines set forth in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses statement issued jointly by banking regulators during  and updated and revised in the statement outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
it also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
was also released at this time which represents the sec staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commi ssion s interpretations 
it is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators 
as a result of the march agreement with the federal reserve bank  the company has written several plans to address the management of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
specifically  the company has three written plans which directly address these issues plan to strengthen credit risk management practices includes the responsibility of board to establish appropriate risk tolerance guidelines and limits  timely and accurate identification and quantification of credit risk  strategies to minimize credit losses and reduce the level of problem assets  procedures for the ongoing review of the investment portfolio to evaluate other than temporary impairment  stress testing for commercial real estate loans and portfolio segments  and measures to reduce the levels of other real estate owned 
plan to improve adversely classified assets includes specific plans and strategies to improve the bank s asset position through repayment  amortization  liquidation  additional collateral  or other means on each loan  relationship  or other asset in excess of million including oreo  that are past due more than days as of the date of the written agreement 
plan for maintenance of adequate allowance for loan losses includes policies and procedures to ensure adherence to the bank s revised alll methodology  provides for periodic reviews of the methodology as appropriate  and provides for review of alll by the board at least quarterly 
also as part of the agreement with the federal reserve bank  board oversight has been enhanced to monitor the operations of the company including  but not limited to  asset improvement and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
with regard to asset improvement  the company will not  directly or indirectly  extend  renew  or restructure any loan to any borrower  including any related interest of the borrower  whose loans were criticized by the federal reserve bank in their june examination  or any subsequent examination  without prior approval of a majority of the board of directors 
any extensions of credit  renewals  or restructurings on loans to such borrowers approved by the board of directors  will be supported with detailed written justification 
any additional loan  relationship  or asset in excess of million that becomes past due more than days  will be subject to a written plan to improve the company s position with regard to the asset  and that plan will be submitted to the federal reserve bank 
the company will submit written reports to the federal reserve bank on a quarterly basis to include updates to progress made on asset improvement  as well as review and monitoring of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan losses includes an asset specific component  as well as a general or formula based component 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under the formula based component of the allowance 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under current accounting guidelines are not subject to the formula based reserve analysis  and evaluated individually for specific impairment under the asset specific component of the allowance 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements loan segments for loan loss reserve analysis loan balances at december  dollars in s commercial and business loans government program loans total commercial and industrial commercial real estate term loans single family residential loans home improvement home equity loans total real estate mortgage total re construction and development loans total agricultural loans consumer loans overdraft protection lines overdrafts total installment other total lease financing total loans the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for problem graded loans classified loans and the unallocated allowance in addition  the allowance analysis also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided current accounting standards for contingencies 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
the twelfth quarter loss factor is compared to the th and th quarter loss factors and the average loss factor for the quarters 
the model may be more heavily weighted on the most current periods if those periods are more indicative of future trends because losses are accelerating in the shorter term 
based on an analysis of the information  current economic conditions and current and historical loss trends for the bank  the existing net loss factors  prior to qualitative adjustment  are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in loss histories and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weakness es which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
at december   problem graded or classified loans totaled million or of gross loans  as compared to million or of gross loans at december  loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
at december   and  the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled   and  respectively 
the reserve for unfunded commitments is considered a reserve for contingent liabilities and is therefore carried as a liability on the balance sheet for all periods presented 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified loans  impaired loans  and other loans in which management believes there is a probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
for impaired loans  specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
formula allowances for classified loans excluding impaired loans  specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the following table summarizes the specific allowance  formula allowance  and unallocated allowance at december   and balance balance balance in s december  december  december  specific allowance impaired loans formula allowance classified loans not impaired formula allowance special mention loans total allowance for special mention and classified loans formula allowance for pass loans unallocated allowance total allowance impaired loans classified loans not considered impaired total classified loans special mention loans although the total loan portfolio has declined over the past three years from million at december  to million at december   to million at december   the level of nonperforming loans has remained high over the past three years  but declined from million at december  to million at december  during the same period  total classified loans decreased from a high of million at december  to million at december  and then decreased to million at december  december  december  december  allowance for loan losses period end net loans charged off during period llr provision during period loans outstanding at period end alll as of loans at period end nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans alll as of nonperforming loans impaired loans classified loans not considered impaired total classified loans alll as of classified loans impaired loans decreased approximately million between december  and december   but increased approximately million during the quarter ended december  the specific allowance related to impaired loans increased million and million for the year ended and quarter ended december  the formula allowance related to loans that are not impaired including special mention and substandard decreased approximately million between december  and december   and decreased  during the quarter ended december  decreases in the formula allowance for the year ended december  were the result of decreases in the volume of loans in those categories  which was only partially offset by increases in adjusting factors for current economic trends and conditions  and tr ends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans 
the level of pass loans decreased approximately million during the year ended december   and the related formula allowance decreased  during as a result of that volume decrease which more than offset increases in percentage loss allocations  as well as factor allocation increases due to current economic conditions 
at december   the company segregated approximately million of the total million in substandard classified loans for purposes of the quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses under the formula allowance 
many of these loans had been downgraded to substandard because the borrowers had other direct or indirect lending relationships which were classified as substandard or impaired 
the million in substandard loans consisted of ten borrowing relationships  which although classified as substandard  the company believed were performing and therefore did not warrant the same loss factors as other substandard loans in the portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to this million pool of substandard loans was based upon current payment history  loan to value ratios  future anticipated performance  and other various factors 
the formula allowance for credit losses related to these substandard loans totaled million at december  this formula reserve was previously included in the formula allowance for special mention and classified loans totaling million at december  in the above table 
during the second quarter of  the performance of the segregated substandard loan portfolio deteriorated to a point where management determined that the loans were either impaired or subject to the higher loss factors traditionally applied to other substandard loans 
as a result  approximately million of the previously segregated substandard loans were transferred to impaired loans  and the remainder analyzed using applicable formula loss factors related to their risk ratings 
the increase in the reserve for impaired loans related to this transfer totaled million during the quarter ended june  and an increase of approximately  in o ther reserve categories during the same period 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors  which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly and monthly basis  and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports  which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
as the real estate market and economic crisis became more severe beginning during the later part of  th e company has successfully worked with many of its borrowers to re margin loans as collateral values declined  weakening the company s credit position and increasing the potential for losses 
this process of working with potentially troubled borrowers is monitored closely through the loan review process 
the specific allowance for impaired loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other tha n delinquent loans 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
at december  and  the company recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   are million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and mi llion during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  in income on such loans 
for the year ended december   the company recognized no income on such loans 
the largest category of impaired loans during the year ended december  has been real estate construction and development loans  with that loan category comprising almost of total impaired loans at december  impaired construction loans decreased million  impaired commercial and industrial loans increased million  and impaired agricultural loans increased million during the year ended december  with the decline in impaired balances for construction loans during the year ended december   the specific reserve related to impaired construction loans decreased approximately  during  while specific reserves related to commercial and industrial loans increased million during specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information  econo mic trends within geographic markets  loan to value ratios  and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral 
adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors

the company makes various types of concessions when structuring tdr s including rate reductions  payment extensions  and forbearance 
at december   more than million of the total million in tdr s was for real estate construction and development  and there was another million and million related to those developers in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial  respectively at december  at december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in restructured residential mortgage loans as the result of borrowers that were unable to get take out financing at the end of their construction loan with the company 
in part to aid the borrowers retain their newly completed homes under california senate bill sb  the company termed these loans at market rates of interest with loans fully amortizing over years with a three to five year repayment term 
the percentage breakout of tdr s at december  is similar to the percentage breakout of the million in tdr s reported at december   the majority of these credits are related to real estate construction projects that have slowed significantly or stalled  and the company has sought to res tructure the credits to allow the construction industry time to recover  and the developers time to finish projects at a slower pace which reflects current market conditions in the san joaquin valley 
concessions granted in these circumstances include lengthened maturity terms  lower lot release prices  or rate reductions that will enable the borrower to finish the construction projects and repay their loans to the company 
the downturn in the real estate construction market has been protracted  and although the company has had some success in its restructuring efforts  it is difficult to conclude that we will be entirely successful in our efforts 
areas such as bakersfield california have been slower to recover than others in out market area 
if conditions deteriorate beyond current expectations  the company may be required to make additional concessions in the future including lower lot release prices to allow borrowers to complete and sell construction units at lower prices currently reflected in the real estate market

as of december   the company has no commercial real estate cre workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans ie  a note b note structure 
for a restructured loan to return to accrual status there needs to be at least months successful payment history 
in addition  our credit administration performs a financial analysis of the credit to determine whether the borrower has the ability to continue to perform successfully over the remaining life of the loan 
this includes  but is not limited to  review of financial statements and cash flow analysis of the borrower 
only after determination that the borrower has the ability to perform under the terms of the loans  will the restructured credit be considered for accrual status 
the following table summarizes special mention loans by type for the nine month ended december  and december  in thousands december  december  commercial and industrial real estate mortgage commercial real estate residential mortgages home equity loans total real estate mortgage re construction development agricultural installment other lease financing total special mention loans the company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area and other geographical areas in which it does business  which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio 
the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
with interest rates decreasing basis points during the fourth quarter of  another basis points during  indications are that the economy will continue to suffer in the near future as a result of sub prime lending problems  a weakened real estate market  and tight credit markets 
as a result of these conditions  the company has placed increased emphasis on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and the level of losses taken  if any  on the disposition of these assets if required it has been in the best interest of both the company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure in an effort to diminish the impact on an already depressed real estate market 
as part of this strategy  the company has increased its level of troubled debt restructurings  when it makes economic sense 
both business and consumer spending have slowed during the past several quarters  and current gdp projections for the next year have softened significantly 
it is difficult to determine to what degree the federal reserve will adjust short term interest rates in its efforts to influence the economy  or what magnitude government economic support programs will reach 
it is likely that the business environment in california will continue to be influenced by these domestic as well as global events 
the local market has remained relatively more stable economically during the past several years than other areas of the state and the nation  which have experienced more volatile e conomic trends  including significant deterioration of residential real estate markets 
although the local area residential housing markets have been hit hard  they continue to perform better than other parts of the state  which should bode well for sustained  but slower growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
local unemployment rates in the san joaquin valley remain high primarily as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics  however unemployment rates have increased recently as the national economy has declined 
it is difficult to predict what impact this will have on the local economy 
the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain reasonable relative to other areas of the state 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and take s these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the following table provides a summary of the company allowance for credit losses  provisions made to that allowance  and charge off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated 
december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period before deducting allowances for credit losses average net loans outstanding during period balance of allowance at beginning of period loans charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loan recoveries net loans charged off reclassification of off balance sheet reserve reserve acquired in business acquisition provision charged to operating expense balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period net loan charge offs to total average loans net loan charge offs to loans at end of period allowance for credit losses to total loans at end of period net loan charge offs to allowance for credit losses net loan charge offs to provision for credit losses both net loan charge offs and recoveries increased during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  loan charge offs of million experienced during the year ended december  included a million charge off of an impaired nonaccrual loan which had a specific reserve of million at december   a charge off of  on a million nonaccrual loan transferred to oreo during the second quarter of  and a  charge off resulting from a short sale of the underlying collateral for a real estate secured loan 
charge offs during the fourth quarter of includes  in an agricultural loan  approximately million in commercial and industrial loans  as well as approximately million in construction and real estate commercial loans 
recoverie s during included  in death benefit proceeds received during the second quarter from a life insurance policy held as collateral on a loan that had been charged off during the following is a summary of the quarterly activity in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended december  description loss recoveries provision balance balance forward st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total ytd at december  and   and  respectively  of the formula allowance is allocated to unfunded loan commitments and is  therefore  carried separately in other liabilities 
management believes that the credit loss allowance to total loans at december  is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
allowance allowance allowance allowance allowance for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of dollars in thousands losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage re construction and development agricultural installment other lease financing not allocated during  reserve allocations increased in all categories except installment loans and lease financing loans  which decreased approximately  and  respectively  during the year 
increases in reserve allocations during are primarily the result of declining collateral values during the year 
during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  real estate mortgage loans  construction loans  and installment loans 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans are the result of increased loan volume and increased loss factors applied to classified loan classifications  while increases in reserve allocations for real estate mortgage and installment loans are primarily the result of increases in substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations increased for real estate construction loans as a result of both an increase in the level of special mention loans in that category  as well as increased specific reserves on certain loans in that category between december  and december  during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  as well as construction and agricultural loans 
as with prior years  the significant reserve allocation for lease financing loans is the result of specific reserves allocated to a lease portfolio that has been nonperforming since and is in the process of litigation see discussion following 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans  construction loans  as well as agricultural loans  are the result of increases in special mention and substandard loans in those categories  with an increase in the volume of loans considered impaired 
successful re margining of a number of the company s problem loans during the third and fourth quarters of helped to reduce potential loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million    and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate  residential mortgage loans  and agricultural loans  respectively at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and no unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million    and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate  installment loans  and agricultural loans  respectively 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated reserve 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million   and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  real estate commercial loans  and agricultural loans  respectively 
the total formula allowance decreased approximately million between and  primarily as the result of decreased volume in pass loans 
the formula allowance for commercial loans decreased million during  and decreased  for installment loans  with only minor changes in other loan categories 
between december  and december   substandard loans decreased million  while special mention and doubtful loans decreased million and million  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of increased loss factors applied to pass loans which more than outweighed the decline in volume of pass loans 
between december  and december   subsubstandard loans decreased million  while special mention loans decreased million  but the specific reserve increased million during the period as a result of deterioration in the impaired loan portfolio 
the total formula allowance decreased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of decreased volume in pass loans 
the formula allowance for construction loans decreased  during  but increased  and  for commercial real estate loans and agricultural loans  respectively  with only minor changes in other loan categories 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans increased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and million  respectively 
increases in loan downgrades experienced during were primarily the result of continued deterioration in the overall economy  including the residential construction market  which in turn has impacted other sectors of the lending portfolio 
although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december  and december   the company had an unall ocated allowance of  and  while at december   the company had no unallocated allowance 
management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however the portfolio percentages fall within the company loan policy guidelines 
it is the company policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands  except footnote nonaccrual loans restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets loans  past due days or more  still accruing non performing loans to total gross loans non performing assets to total gross loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans included in nonaccrual loans at december    and are restructured loans totaling million  million  and  respectively 
the interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans outstanding at december    and  in accordance with their original terms is approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
non performing assets remain high at december   but have decreased million between december  and december  while nonaccrual loans decreased only  between december  and december   restructured loans not included in the nonaccrual totals decreased million as the company sought to work out problem credits with borrowers 
the net decrease of  in other real estate owned includes additions of approximately million in properties transferred from loans  write downs of  million  and gross sales of more than million during the year ended december  non performing assets have increased between december  and december  as the prolonged economic downturn continued into while nonaccrual loans decreased million between december  and december   restructured loans not included in the nonaccrual totals increased million as the company sought to work out problem credits with borrowers 
when all other means of repayment failed  the underlying collateral on nonperforming loans was foreclosed upon  resulting in the net increase of million in other real estate owned between december  and december  the net change in other real estate owned includes additions of approximately million in properties transferred from loans  and gross sales of nearly million durin g the year ended december  non performing assets increased between december  and december  as declines in real estate markets and related sectors experienced since the later part of resulting from lending problems continued to impact credit markets and the general economy throughout nonaccrual loans increased million between december  and december   with construction loans comprising approximately of total nonaccrual loans at december   and commercial and industrial loans comprising another 
the following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown balance balance balance change from change from nonaccrual loans in s december  december  december  december  december  commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural installment other lease financing total nonaccrual loans the increase of million in commercial and industrial non accrual loans between december  and december  is largely the result of a single large commercial lending relationship totaling million which was transferred to nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of the decrease of  in total nonaccrual loans between december  and december  includes transfers of nearly million to other real estate owned 
of the million in transfers from nonaccrual loans to other real estate owned during  million was transferred during the fourth quarter of loans past due more than days are receiving increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk 
the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
except for the loans included in the above table  and the land development loan discussed above  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal hom e loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
cash and cash equivalents have fluctuated during the three years ended december    and  with period end balances as follows from consolidated statements of cash flows in s balance december  december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year ended december   as compared to an increase of million during the year ended december   and a decrease of million during the year ended december  the company has maintained positive cash flows from operations over the past three years  which amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as the company experienced significant decreases in loans  and through the sales or oreo properties  as well as maturities of investment securities 
the company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as the company experienced maturities of investment securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks  as well as net decreases in loans 
the company experienced net cash outflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as purchases of investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks exceeded net loan payoffs and maturities of investment securities during the period 
net cash flows from financing activities  including deposit growth and borrowings  have traditionally provided funding sources for loan growth  but during   and the company experienced net cash outflows totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the cash outflows experienced during were the result of reductions in levels of brokered time deposits and borrowings from the fhlb which more than offset increases in core deposits 
the cash outflows experienced during were primarily the result of planned reductions in outstanding borrowings which exceeded increases in deposit accounts 
during declines in net deposit accounts  as well as repurchases of the company s common stock  exceeded growth in financing categories  including borrowings 
the company has the ability to decrease lo an growth  increase deposits and borrowings  or a combination of both to manage balance sheet liquidity 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  sets wholesale funding limits  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements  which comply with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to unused lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes identified funding sources  and steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below policy limits for any extended period of time 
one of the primary directives of the contingency funding plan is to limit the company s overall level of wholesale funding to no more than of deposits 
the current funding program uses both asset based and liability based principles  and identifies core deposits as the favored funding source when attainable at a reasonable cost 
the policy identifies a number of funding sources or methods th e bank alco committee may utilize to fulfill the company s liquidity funding requirements local core deposits are the company s primary funding source 
the company must expand its efforts to attract these deposits through service related and competitive pricing tactics 
other liquidity funding sources should only be consider of local core deposits are not attractive because of maturity or pricing 
unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
currently  unsecured borrowing lines with correspondents are limited and may not be reliable for long periods of time or in times of economic stress 
other funding sources such as secured credit lines with the federal home loan bank or the federal reserve may be used for longer periods 
the company collateralizes these available lines with a combination of investment securities and pledged loans 
the company has utilized specific loan pledging with both the fhlb and the federal reserve to better ensure the continued availability of those lines of credit 
the company presently has a discount window facility available from the federal reserve bank of san francisco collateralized with loans as discussed above 
at december  the company had available credit of million from the federal reserve based upon the loans pledged at that date 
the federal reserve will monitor use of the discount window closely given the current status of the company and the economy as a whole and 
in addition  this credit facility may not be competitively priced under normal economic conditions 
as such  the company does not expect to use this facility except in times of crises  but does consider this to be a key contingency funding source 
as long as the bank remains well capitalized the company may rely on brokered deposits when core deposit rates are higher in the marketplace or maturity structures are not desirable 
the company s current policy limit for brokered deposits is of total deposits 
the company may also utilize other wholesale deposit sources such as memberships that advertise the bank s time deposit rates to other subscribers  typically banks and credit unions 
the company s current policy limit on other wholesale deposits is of total deposits 
the bank may sell whole loans or participations in loans to provide additional liquidity 
during economic downturns or other crises events  these funding sources may be difficult to achieve in a short period of time or at a reasonable price 
as such  this strategy is better used as a long term asset liability management tool to effectively balance assets and liabilities to reduce liquidity risk 
the company currently has bank owned life insurance boli policies issued by highly rated insurance companies which may be sold to increase liquidity 
the company owns certain real estate including its administration building and several of its branches 
these may be sold and vacated or leased back from the purchaser after sale to provide additional liquidity if needed 
the sales process may require substantial time to complete  and may have an adverse impact on earnings depending on market rates and other factors at the time of sale 
investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
at the current time much of the investment portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits and borrowing lines 
as wholesale funding dependence is reduced  the available liquidity in the investment portfolio will increase 
the company seeks to maintain an investment grade securities portfolio to ensure quality collateral for pledging against borrowing lines of credit as well as to provide liquidity in times of needs 
the company continues to utilize liability management  when needed  as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabil ities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included in previously in the financial condition section of this financial review 
the federal reserve board has notified the bank that it will permit the bank to draw on its line of credit with the federal reserve bank only in limited circumstances and for a short duration 
the liquidity of the parent company  united security bancshares  is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  united security bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
the bank currently has limited ability to pay dividends or make capital distributions see regulatory agreement section included in regulatory matters of this management s discussion 
the limited ability of the bank to pay dividends may impact the ability of the company to fund its ongoing liquidity requirements including ongoing operating expenses  as well as quarterly interest payments on the company s junior subordinated debt trust preferred securities 
under an agreement with the federal reserve dated march   the bank is precluded from paying a cash dividend to the company 
to conserve cash and capital resources  the company elected at september  to defer the payment of interest on its junior subordinated debt beginning with the quarterly payment due october  the company has not determined how long it will defer interest payments  but under the terms of the debenture  interest payments may be deferred up to five years quarters 
during such deferral periods  the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock subject to certain exceptions and will continue to accrue interest payable on the junior subordinated debt 
during the year ended december   the bank paid no dividends to the parent company 
during the year ended december   cash dividends paid by the bank to the parent company totaled  contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   the company significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts  or other similar carrying value adjustments

the company and bank have also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt  purchase or redeem any shares of stock  declare or pay any cash dividends  or pay interest on the company junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  without prior written approval from the federal reserve bank 
the company generates no revenue of its own and as such  relies on dividends from the bank to pay its operating expenses and interest payments on the company s junior subordinated debt 
the inability of the bank to pay cash dividends to the company may hinder the company s ability to meet its ongoing operating obligations 
this agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco was a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june report of examination 
the agreement was the result of significant increases in nonperforming assets  both classified loans and oreo  during and increasing the overall risk profile of the bank 
the increased risk profile of the bank included heightened concerns about the bank s use of brokered and other whole funding sources which had been used to fund loan growth and reduce the company s overall cost of interest bearing liabilities 
with loan growth funded to some degree by wholesale funding sources  liquidity risk increased  and higher levels of nonperforming assets increased risk to equity capital and potential volatility in earnings 
the agreement s major components and requirements for the bank are as follows strengthen board oversight of the bank s management and operations by the bank submitting a written plan to the federal reserve bank to address and include i the actions that the board will take to improve the bank s conditions and maintain effect control over  and supervision of the bank s major operations and

capital adequacy the board of governors of the federal reserve system board of governors has adopted regulations requiring insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries  plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities to total assets 
institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to total assets 
all other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum requirement 
the board of governors has also adopted a statement of policy  supplementing its leverage capital ratio requirements  which provides definitions of qualifying total capital consisting of tier capital and tier supplementary capital  including the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and sets forth minimum risk based capital ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
insured institutions are required to maintain a ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
pursuant to the march agreement with the federal reserve bank  the company and the bank are required to maintain sufficient capital to support current and future capital needs  including compliance with capital adequacy guidelines taking into account the volume of classified assets  concentrations of credit  the level of the allowance for loan losses  current and projected growth  and projected retained earnings 
pursuant to the order issued by the california department of financial institutions in may  the bank is required to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than 
for purposes of the order  tangible shareholders equity is defined as shareholders equity minus intangible assets 
the bank s ratio of tangible shareh olders equity to total tangible assets was at december  as part of the march agreement  the company has written  and submitted to the federal reserve bank  a capital plan that includes guidelines and trigger points to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at the bank and the company  and that capital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines given the level of classified assets  concentrations of credit  alll  current and projected growth  and projected retained earnings 
the capital plan also contains contingency strategies to obtain additional capital as required to fulfill future capital requirements for both the bank as a separate legal entity  and the company on a consolidated basis 
the capital plan also addresses the requirement of both the bank and the company to comply with the federal banks capital adequacy guidelines  and contingen cy plans to ensure the maintenance of adequate capital levels under those guidelines 
the following table sets forth the company s and the bank actual capital positions at december  and the regulatory minimums for the company and the bank to be well capitalized under the guidelines discussed above company bank regulatory actual actual minimum minimums capital ratios capital ratios capital ratios well capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio as is indicated by the above table  the company and the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  management believes that  under the current regulations  both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
dividends dividends paid to shareholders by the company are subject to restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law 
the california general corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal the amount of the proposed distribution 
the primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the company from the bank 
as noted earlier  the company and the bank have entered into an agreement with the federal reserve bank that  among other things  require us to obtain the prior approval before paying a cash dividend or otherwise making a distribution on our stock  increasing debt  repurchasing the company s common stock  or any other action which would reduce capital of either the bank or the company 
in addition  effective october  the company elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with its trust preferred securities 
under the subordinated debenture agreement  the company is prohibited from paying any dividends or making any other distribution on its common stock fo r so long as interest payments are being deferred 
in addition  under the agreement with the federal reserve bank  the company is now prohibited from making interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures without prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
during the year ended december   the company received no cash dividends from the bank 
the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in california state banking law  and administered by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner 
under such restrictions  the bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the bank or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time 
if the above test is not met  cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the commissioner  in an amount not exceeding the bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year 
such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends  which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the commissioner 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the commissioner finds that the shareholders equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound  the commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend 
the frb may also limit dividends paid by the bank 
as noted above  the terms of the regulatory agreement with the federal reserve prohibit both the company and the bank from paying dividends without prior approval of the federal reserve

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and market risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or is subject to interest rate adjustments as market rates of interest change 
interest rate sensitivity is the measure of the volatility of earnings from movements in market rates of interest  which is generally reflected in interest rate spread 
as interest rates change in the market place  yields earned on assets do not necessarily move in tandem with interest rates paid on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is related to liquidity in that each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds 
interest rate sensitivity is also affected by assets and liabilities with interest rates that are subject to change prior to maturity 
the object of interest rate sensitivity management is to minimize the impact on earnings from interest rate changes in the marketplace 
in recent years  deregulation  causing liabilities to become more interest rate sensitive  combined with interest rate volatility in the capital markets  has placed additional emphasis on this principal 
when management decides to maintain repricing imbalances  it usually does so on the basis of a well conceived strategy designed to ensure that the risk is not excessive and that liquidity is properly maintained 
the company interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco  which reports to the board of directors on a periodic basis  pursuant to established operating policies and procedures 
as part of its overall risk management  the company pursues various asset and liability management strategies  which may include obtaining derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest fluctuations on the company s net interest margin 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a five year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with the purpose of minimizing interest rate fluctuations on its interest rate margin and equity 
the interest rate swap agreement matured on september  interest rate risk can be measured through various methods including gap  duration and market value analysis as well as income simulation models  which provides a dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity based on the assumptions of the company s management 
the company employs each of these methods and refines these processes to make the most accurate measurements possible 
the information provided by these calculations is the basis for management decisions in managing interest rate risk 
from the gap report below  the company is apparently subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its liabilities have the potential to reprice more quickly than its assets within the next year 
at december   the company had a cumulative month gap of million or of total earning assets 
management believes the gap analysis shown below is not entirely indicative of the company s actual interest rate sensitivity  because certain interest sensitive assets and liabilities would not reprice to the same degree as the change in underlying market rates 
approximately million of the floating rate loans included in the million immediately adjustable category have rate floors and would only change to some degree if any  depending on the magnitude of changes in market rates 
of the million in floating rate loans with rate floors  approximately million have floors more than basis points above the current loan index rate  and thus rates on those loans would not change for the first basis point increase in market rates 
interest bearing checking and savings accounts which are also included in the immediately adjustable column probably would move only a portion of the total change in market rates and  in fact  might not even move at all 
the effects of market value risk have been mitigated to some degree by the makeup of the bank balance sheet 
loans are generally short term or are floating rate instruments 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio matures or reprices within one year  and less than of the portfolio matures or reprices in more than years 
total investment securities including call options and prepayment assumptions  have a combined duration of approximately years 
more than million or of interest bearing liabilities mature or can be repriced within the next months  even though the rate elasticity of deposits with no defined maturities may not necessarily be the same as interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company gap  or estimated interest rate sensitivity profile based on ending balances as of december   representing the interval of time before earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond to changes in market rates of interest 
assets and liabilities are categorized by remaining interest rate maturities rather than by principal maturities of obligations

the company utilizes a vendor purchased simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on a   and basis point rise and a   and basis point fall in interest rates ramped over a twelve month period  with net interest impacts projected out as far as twenty four months 
in addition  a most likely scenario is projected based upon expected rate changes over the month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the company interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment of certain assets and liabilities 
projected net interest income is calculated assuming customers will reinvest maturing deposit accounts and the company will originate new loans 
the balance sheet growth assumptions utilized correspond closely to the company strategic growth plans and annual budget 
excess cash is invested in overnight funds or other short term investments such as us treasuries 
cash shortfalls are covered through additional borrowing of overnight or short term funds 
the board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in net interest income of and in the event of a bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
based on the information and assumptions utilized in the simulation model at december  the resultant projected impact on net interest income falls within policy limits set by the board of directors for all rate scenarios simulated 
the company also utilizes the same vendor purchased simulation model to project the impact of changes in interest rates on the underlying market value of all the company assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet accounts under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the resultant net value  as impacted under each projected interest rate scenario  is referred to as the market value of equity mv of equity 
this technique captures the interest rate risk of the company business mix across all maturities 
the market analysis is performed using an immediate rate shock of   and basis points up and down  and basis points up  calculating the present value of expected cash flows under each rate environment at applicable discount rates 
the market value of loans is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows over e ither the term to maturity for fixed rate loans or scheduled repricing for floating rate loans using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the market value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from reliable independent brokers 
the market value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using current rates for similar instruments of comparable maturities 
the market value of deposits with no defined maturities  including interest bearing checking  money market and savings accounts is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at a rate equal to the difference between the cost of these deposits and the alternate use of the funds  federal funds in this case 
assumed maturities for these deposits are estimated using decay analysis and are generally assumed to have implied maturities of less than five years 
for noninterest sensitive assets and liabilities  the market value is equa l to their carrying value amounts at the reporting date 
the company interest rate risk policy establishes maximum decreases in the company market value of equity of and in the event of an immediate and sustained bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates 
as shown in the table below  the percentage changes in the net market value of the company equity are within policy limits for both rising and falling rate scenarios 
the following sets forth the analysis of the company market value risk inherent in its interest sensitive financial instruments as they relate to the entire balance sheet at december  and december  in thousands 
fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with absolute precision 
assumptions have been made as to the appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows and other variables 
changes in these assumptions significantly affect the estimates and as such  the obtained fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in the actual sale or liquidation of such financial instruments  nor comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  fair value estimates a re based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate future business
