item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify these forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend  or continue  and similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
our properties are primarily located in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we act as the operator of certain of these properties 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 

table of contents our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term suc cess 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
at december   our estimated total proved oil  natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm  cawley  gillespie associates  inc  were approximately  thousand barrels of oil equivalent mboe  consisting of  thousand barrels bbls of oil  and  million cubic feet mcf of natural gas and  thousand barrels bbls natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed producing see note to consolidated financial statements  supplemental oil and gas information 
we maintain operational control of approximately of our proved reserves 
full year production averaged mboe d compared to mboe d in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial st atements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
oil and natural gas activities accounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved oil and natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and sec guidelines 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization and impairment expense 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir will also result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 

table of contents our policies and procedures regarding internal controls over the recording of our oil and natural gas reserves are structured to objectively and accurately estimate our oil and natural gas reserve quantities and present values in compliance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the sec s regulations 
compliance with these rules and regulations is the responsibility of our senior engineer  who is also our principal engineer 
our controls over reserve estimates include retention of cawley  gillespie associates  inc as our independent petroleum engineers 
we provide cawley  gillespie associates  inc information concerning our oil and natural gas properties  including production profiles  prices and costs  and they prepare their independent estimates of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
all of the information regarding reserves in this annual report on form k is derived from the report of cawley  gillespie associates  inc  which is included as an exhibit to this annual report 
we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and an attorney experienced in petroleum land titles who work closely with cawley gillespie to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of the data furnished to cawley  gillespie associates  inc for their reserves estimation process 
our senior engineer reviews and approves the reserve information compiled by our internal staff 
our technical teams and representatives of cawley  gillespie associates  inc also jointly review our properties and discuss the methods and assumptions used by cawley  gillespie associates  inc in the preparation of their year end reserve estimates 
depreciation  depletion and amortization our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
impairment we review our property and equipment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment asc 
asc requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value 
further  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future 
additionally  these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculations are numer ous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of obligations and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next and months  respectively 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts  which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations 
we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs 
our results of operations would p otentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivative contracts 
income taxes the company follows asc  income taxes  asc  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary historical sources of capital and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations  availability under our senior credit agreements with our unrelated bank lenders with bank of nova scotia and wells fargo senior credit agreements and loans from various related party lenders related party loans and asset dispositions 
we continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  our cash flows  capital resources and drilling success 
note to our consolidated financial statements  long term debt and interest expense  describes the senior credit agreements and related party loans 
our senior credit agreements originally provided a total million in credit facilities 
as of december   the combined total credit available borrowing base available for was approximately million 
on march  the company terminated its relationship with wells fargo and paid its debt to wells fargo  further reducing the total credit available to approximately million at that date 
the borrowing base which relates to our oil and natural gas properties is redetermined on a semi annual basis with the company and the lenders each having the right to one unscheduled redetermination per year and adjusted based on our oil and natural gas prope rties  reserves  other indebtedness and other relevant factors 
see note to consolidated financial statements  long term debt and interest expense 
our ability to utilize the full amount of our borrowing capacity is influenced by a variety of factors  including redeterminations of our borrowing base and covenants under our senior credit agreements 
our senior credit agreements contain customary financial and other covenants  including minimum working capital levels of not less than to  leverage ratio of not greater than to and minimum coverage of interest of not less than to in addition  the company is subject to covenants limiting dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the senior credit agreements 
our future capital resources and liquidity may depend  in part  on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success in finding and acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit agreements 
long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and prices and our commodity price hedging activities as well as various economic conditions that have historica lly affected the oil and natural gas industry 
debt as of december  in thousands except percentage senior credit facilities long term debt related party short term debt related party current maturities of long term debt  short term debt and bank overdraft total debt stockholders equity debt to capital ratio 
table of contents at year end  our total debt was  compared to total debt of  at year end and  at year end as of december   current debt included  as current maturities of the senior credit facilities 
however  the company is not obligated to repay the facilities prior to the due date  except for such payments as may be required under the senior credit agreements in the event of a redetermination and reduction of the borrowing base 
as of december   the  included as current maturities was due to the decision by management to continue reducing our debt below the borrowing base 
as of december   current debt included  as current maturities  which again was due to management s decision to continue payments to reduce debt below the borrowing base 
on march   the company entered into a loan agreement with ioc pursuant to which it borrowed the sum of million 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is payable in quarterly payments of interest only until march   when all accrued interest and principal is due and payable 
the loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the loan is unsecured 
the purpose of the loan was to provide funds to isramco for the payment of amounts due under the wells fargo senior credit facility at maturity 
on march  isramco paid the outstanding principal balance due under the wells fargo senior credit agreement 
subsequently  on march   pursuant to an agreement with wells fargo  the derivative contracts between isramco and wells fargo were terminated at a cost to the company of approximately  concurrently  the company entered into new derivative contracts for  barrels of crude oil during the month period commencing march with macquarie bank  na off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
cash flow our primary source of cash in and was from operating activities 
our primary sources of cash in were from operating and financing activities 
in and  cash received from operations was offset by repayments of borrowings under our senior credit agreements and cash used in payments on addition to oil and gas properties  net of any divestiture activities 
in  proceeds from loans obtained from related parties  proceeds from the senior credit agreements and cash received from operations were offset by repayments of our senior credit agreements  repayments of loans from related parties and cash used in investing activities to fund continued enhancement of operations acquisition activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities  net cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes  hedging activities and operating cost 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction in working capital of  higher lease operating expenses and expenses related to our well plugging and abandonment obligations 
the reduction in net cash proceeds from our commodity price hedging activities of  was offset by increased oil and natural gas revenues of  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher average oil and gas prices for the year ended december  of bbl and mcf  compared to bbl and mcf for the year ended december  however  we are unable to predict future production levels or future commodity prices  and  therefore  we cannot predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in our average daily production volumes and gain from net cash received on settled derivative contracts which was partially offset by the  and decrease in natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids prices  respectively 

table of contents investing activities  the primary driver of cash used in investing activities in and is capital spending 
the primary component of cash used in investing activities in was capital spending for acquisitions and development 
cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

to assess the operating results of isramco  management analyzes income from operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts and dd a expense and impairments adjusted ebitdax 
adjusted ebitdax is not a gaap measure 
isramco s definition of adjusted ebitdax excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period  but rather is monitored by management as a part of the costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  isramco excludes dd a expense and impairments from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to isramco s financing methods or capital structure 
adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make payments on its long term loans 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations 
however  adjusted ebitdax  as defined by isramco  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  isramco s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income loss from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of isramco s results as reported under gaap
