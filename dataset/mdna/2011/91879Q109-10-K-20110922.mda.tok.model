item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements section and item a  risk factors each included in this form k 
management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of our segments 
we have chosen to specifically include reported ebitda defined as segment net revenue less segment operating expense  plus or minus segment equity investment income or loss and for the real estate segment  plus gain on sale of real property and net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents  in the following discussion because we consider these measurements to be significant indications of our financial performance and available capital resources 
reported ebitda and net debt are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
we utilize reported ebitda in evaluating our performance and in allocating resources to our segments 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc we also believe that net debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of net debt 
items excluded from reported ebitda and net debt are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance or liquidity 
reported ebitda and net debt should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because reported ebitda and net debt are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  reported ebitda and net debt as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
overview our operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate 
resort is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
revenue from the mountain  lodging and real estate segments represented  and  respectively  of our net revenue for fiscal mountain segment the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of six ski resort properties as well as ancillary services  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
our six ski resorts were open for business for the ski season from mid november through mid april  which is the peak operating season for the mountain segment 
our single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i destination guests and ii in state guests 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  while in state guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  which compares to approximately and  respectively  for the ski season and and  respectively  for the ski season excluding northstar at tahoe for each of the current and prior ski seasons 
destination guests generally purchase our higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental  as well as lodging at or around our resorts 
destination guest visitation is less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  but can be more impacted by adverse economic conditions or the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more value oriented and weather sensitive 
we offer a variety of season pass products for all of our ski resorts  marketed towards both destination and in state guests 
our season pass product offerings range from providing access to a combination of our resorts to our epic season pass that allows pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all six of our ski resorts 
our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn assists us in developing a loyal base of customers who commit to ski at our resorts generally in advance of the ski season and typically ski more days each season at our resorts than those guests who do not buy season passes 
as such  our season pass program drives strong customer loyalty  mitigates exposure to many weather sensitive guests  and generates additional ancillary spending 
in addition  our season pass products attract new guests to our resorts 
all of our season pass products  including the epic season pass  are sold predominately prior to the start of the ski season 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the ski season 
for the  and ski seasons approximately  and  respectively  of total lift revenue recognized was comprised of season pass revenue 
the cost structure of our ski resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including  but not limited to  forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental cost of sales and labor  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  profit margins can fluctuate greatly based on the level of revenues 
lodging segment operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including several proximate to our ski resorts  ii ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to our ski resorts  iii gtlc  iv cme  a resort ground transportation company  and v golf courses 
the performance of lodging properties including managed condominium rooms at or around our ski resorts  and cme  is closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment and generally experiences similar seasonal trends  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests  and represented approximately  and of lodging segment revenue excluding lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
management primarily focuses on lodging net revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursement and lodging operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs which are not measures of financial performance under gaap as the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as such the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda which we use to evaluate lodging segment performance 
revenue of the lodging segment during our first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s operating season generally occurs from mid may to mid october  golf operations and seasonally low operations from our other owned and managed properties and businesses 
real estate segment the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around our resort communities and primarily engages in vertical development of projects 
currently  the principal activities of our real estate segment include the marketing and selling of remaining condominium units that are available for sale  planning for future real estate development projects  including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits  and the purchase of selected strategic land parcels for future development 
revenue from vertical development projects is not recognized until closing of individual units within a project  which occurs after substantial completion of the project 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of vertical development by often utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits  and potentially obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects although our last two major vertical development projects have not incurred any such direct third party financing 
additionally  our real estate development projects most often result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
our revenue from the real estate segment  and associated expense  can fluctuate significantly based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  causing volatility in the real estate segment s operating results from period to period 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact our future financial performance although we experienced improved operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and in our mountain and lodging segments in part due to increased pricing and increased visitation for the ski season  as well as an increase in overall guest spend on ancillary services  uncertainties still exist around the current general economic environment 
conditions currently present or recently present in the economic environment including high unemployment  relatively low consumer confidence  financial instability in the global markets  including any impact from the downgrade of credit ratings assigned to obligations of the united states  and weakness in the overall real estate market could potentially have negative effects on the travel and leisure industry 
given the current uncertainties around global economic trends  we cannot predict what impact this will have on overall travel and leisure or more specifically  on our guest visitation  guest spending or other related trends for the upcoming ski season 
during the most recent recession  our ski season was impacted by lower visitation  reduced guest spend on ancillary services and closer in booking trends for guest reservations 
the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on mountain and lodging revenue particularly in regards to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation 
to help mitigate this impact  we sell a variety of season pass products prior to the beginning of the season to in state guests and destination guests 
additionally  we have invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
for the ski season we experienced significantly above average early season snowfall compared to significantly below average early season snowfall for the previous two ski seasons  which we believe had a positive impact on early season visitation 
our season pass products provide a value option to our guests which in turn creates a guest commitment predominantly prior to the start of the ski season  resulting in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue for us 
in march  we began our pre season pass sales program for the ski season 
through september  our season pass sales for the ski season were up approximately in sales dollars and in units as compared to season pass sales through the similar period of the ski season  including northstar at tahoe season pass sales for both periods 
we cannot predict if this trend will continue through the fall season pass sales campaign or the impact that season pass sales may have on total lift revenue or etp for the ski season 
in fiscal  our lift ticket revenue was favorably impacted by price increases that were implemented during the ski season 
prices for the ski season have not yet been finalized  and as such  there can be no assurances as to the level of price increases  if any  which will occur and the impact that pricing may have on visitation or revenue 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate held for sale  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing or mix of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received a certificate of occupancy for the ritz carlton residences  vail and we have closed on units in fiscal with two additional units having closed subsequent to july  
additionally  we have closed on four units at one ski hill place which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal units closed in total including units that closed in fiscal 
we currently have on a combined basis units available for sale at the ritz carlton residences  vail  one ski hill place in breckenridge and crystal peak lodge at breckenridge 
we have increased risk associated with selling and closing units in these projects as a result of the continued instability in the credit markets and a slowdown in the overall real estate market 
buyers have been or may be unable to close on units in part due to a reduction in funds available to buyers and or decreases in mortgage availability 
we cannot predict the ultimate number of units that we will sell  the ultimate price we will receive  or when the units will sell  although we currently believe the selling process will take multiple years 
additionally  if a prolonged weakness in the real estate market or general economic conditions were to occur we may have to adjust our anticipated selling prices in an effort to sell and close on units available for sale 
however  our risk associated with adjusting selling prices to levels that may not be acceptable to us is partially mitigated by the fact that do generate cash flow from placing unsold units into our rental program until such time selling prices are at acceptable levels to us 
furthermore  if the current weakness in the real estate market were to persist for multiple years thus requiring us to sell remaining units below recent pricing levels including any sales concessions and discounts for the remaining inventory of units at the ritz carlton residences  vail or one ski hill place in breckenridge  it may result in an impairment charge on one or both projects see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  as well as million available under the revolver component of our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million  which was amended and restated on january  key modifications to the credit agreement included  among other things  the extension of the maturity on the revolving credit agreement from february to january  the expansion of baskets for improved flexibility in our ability to incur debt and make acquisitions  investments and distributions  and the elimination of certain financial covenants 
in addition  on april   we completed an offering for million of senior subordinated notes due the notes  the proceeds of which  along with available cash resources  were used to purchase the outstanding million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes and pay related premiums  fees and expenses 
the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and will mature may  with no principal payments due until maturity 
additionally  we believe the notes will allow for substantially increased flexibility in our ability to make acquisitions  investments and distributions and incur debt 
the above  combined with the completion of our real estate projects where the proceeds from future real estate closings on the ritz carlton residences  vail  one ski hill place in breckenridge and crystal peak lodge at breckenridge are expected to significantly exceed future carrying costs  has and is anticipated to provide us with significant liquidity which will allow us to consider strategic investments  including future acquisitions and other forms of providing return to our shareholders 
we cannot predict that any strategic initiatives undertaken will achieve the anticipated results 
on june   the company s board of directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate estimated to be per share or million annually based upon shares outstanding as of july   subject to quarterly declaration  with the first quarterly dividend of per share paid on july  this dividend was funded through available cash on hand 
subject to the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law  we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  credit agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
under gaap we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as well as on an interim basis to the extent factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets below book value and we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of our reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams  and we evaluate long lived assets based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
our fiscal annual impairment test did not result in a goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
however  if a more severe prolonged weakness in general economic conditions were to occur it could cause less than expected growth and or reduction in terminal values and cash flows and could result in an impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and or long lived assets particularly related to our lodging operations  negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders equity

labor and labor related benefits in the current year were also higher due to the full year impact of the prior year s partial wage reinstatement and our matching component of the k plan  and a more normal level of wage increases  partially offset by a decrease in workers compensation costs of million due to fewer claims and average cost per claim 
additionally  labor costs were impacted by an increase in staffing levels due to an increase in demand for ancillary services primarily in ski school  dining and retail rental operations

total skier visitation increased led by our heavenly resort which experienced a increase in visitation while overall visitation for our four colorado resorts excluding heavenly increased 
our four colorado resorts were negatively impacted by significantly below average snowfall  particularly in the early season up to mid january  but experienced increased visitation during the second half of the ski season particularly during the spring break and easter holiday periods which primarily contributed to the overall increase in skier visits in colorado for the ski season compared to the ski season 
visitation by season pass holders increased by approximately with average visits per season pass holders declining approximately  or approximately one half a day less skied per season pass holder  over the ski season resulting in an increase in etp

the decrease in occupancy is largely attributed to declines in group and transient room nights primarily at our keystone resort 
dining revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decline in group visitation primarily at our keystone resort 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in dining revenue of million at gtlc in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an increase in occupancy as discussed above 
transportation revenues were up million  or  primarily due to a full twelve months of operations for cme included in fiscal compared to only nine months of operations for cme in fiscal golf revenues decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily resulting from a decrease in the number of golf rounds played

the above decreases were partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of million  or  primarily due to higher lodging segment component of corporate costs including increased employee incentive compensation expense  employee medical costs and legal expenses 
revenue from payroll cost reimbursement and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs relates to payroll costs at managed hotel properties where the company is the employer and all payroll costs are reimbursed by the owners of the properties under contractual arrangements

real estate segment real estate segment operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are presented by category as follows in thousands percentage year ended july  increase decrease total real estate net revenue real estate operating expense cost of sales including sales commissions other total real estate operating expense gain on sale of real property real estate reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda includes million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our real estate operating revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period 
different types of projects have different revenue and profit margins  therefore  as the real estate inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment net revenue  operating expense and real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units units sold to the ritz carlton development company and units sold to individuals at the ritz carlton residences  vail million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of

additionally  during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue related to deposits from buyers who defaulted on units under contract at the ritz carlton residences  vail and we closed on four condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the one ski hill place average price per square foot is driven by its premier ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge  its close proximity to the breckconnect gondola and other lifts and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million primarily resulting from the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail average cost per square foot of  and from the closing of four condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of

the cost per square foot for one ski hill place is reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with this project compared to other breckenridge properties and high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which include marketing expense for the real estate available for sale including those units that have not yet closed  carrying costs for units available for sale and overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and the real estate segment component of corporate costs 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and affordable housing units associated with the jhg tc development million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the one ski hill place average price per square foot was driven by its premier ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge  its close proximity to the breckconnect gondola and other lifts and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
additionally  during fiscal we recognized million of revenue related to deposits from buyers who defaulted on units under contract at one ski hill place  and recorded a gain on sale of real property of million net of million in related cost of sales for a land parcel located at the arrowhead base area of the beaver creek resort which sold for million

additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and the real estate segment component of corporate costs 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of eight lodge at vail chalet chalet units million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and two units at the arrabelle million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the higher average price per square foot for the chalet units was driven by their premier location at the base of vail mountain in vail village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive chalets 
the arrabelle average price per square foot is driven by its ski in ski out location in vail  and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
the crystal peak lodge average price per square foot though significantly lower than the vail project real estate sales  is significantly higher than historical breckenridge project real estate sales and is primarily driven by its ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge and close proximity to the breckconnect gondola 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on eight chalet units million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of and two units at the arrabelle million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the arrabelle and chalet units is reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with these projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the cost per square foot for crystal peak lodge is reflective of its less complicated design features and fewer amenities associated with this project relative to the arrabelle and chalet units 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which include marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and the real estate segment component of corporate costs 
in addition  included in other segment operating expense for fiscal  we recorded million of estimated costs in excess of anticipated sales proceeds for an affordable housing commitment resulting from the cancellation of a contract by a third party developer related to our jhg tc development 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to our overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal and fiscal increased primarily due to the impact of an increase in the fixed asset base from the placing in service of significant resort assets over the last three years  which included  among other assets  assets associated with the acquisition of northstar at tahoe and one ski hill place  in breckenridge and multiple gondolas and lifts within the last three years 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  net 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal due to our acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv on april  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the timing of the acquisition of the remaining interest in ssv at the end of the third fiscal quarter of fiscal  as the fourth fiscal quarter operations of ssv are historically a loss period 
asset impairment charge 
we previously extended a million note receivable  including accrued interest  to an entity that owned a hotel in which we manage 
this entity was in default on certain debt held by the entity and the third party owners of the entity were unable to reach an agreement to restructure the debt with their creditor  as a result  the creditor foreclosed on the hotel in june as such  we have recorded an asset impairment charge of million in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt 
in april  we completed an offering for million of notes  the proceeds of which  along with available cash resources  were used to retire the outstanding million principal amount of notes and paid related call premiums  issuance costs  transaction and legal fees 
total costs to retire the notes and issuance costs for the notes were million  of which million were recorded as deferred financing costs and million was recorded as a loss on extinguishment 
additionally  included in the loss on extinguishment is a write off of a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs and legal fees associated with the notes 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal and is primarily due to the significant reduction in the capitalization of interest on self funded real estate projects in fiscal  as all real estate projects under development have reached completion 
the reduction in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest on self funded real estate projects 
capitalized interest was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our tax provision and effective tax rate are driven primarily by the amount of pre tax income  which is adjusted for items that are deductible non deductible for tax purposes only ie permanent items  taxable income generated by state jurisdictions that varies from the consolidated pre tax income and the amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal is largely driven by the higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests recorded in fiscal additionally  the income tax provision recorded for fiscal reflects a million income tax benefit due to a reversal of an income tax contingency resulting from the expiration of the statue of limitations 
in fiscal  the tax provision reflected a million income tax benefit due to a reversal of an income tax contingency resulting from the expiration of the statue of limitations 
in  we amended previously filed tax returns for the tax years from through in an effort to remove restrictions under section of the internal revenue code on approximately million of nols relating to fresh start accounting from our reorganization in as a result  we requested a refund related to the amended returns in the amount of million and have reduced our federal tax liability in the amount of million in subsequent tax returns 
in  the irs completed its examination of our filing position in our amended returns and disallowed our request for refund and our position to remove the restriction on the nols 
we appealed the examiner s disallowance of the nols to the office of appeals 
in december  the office of appeals denied our appeal  as well as a request for mediation 
we disagreed with the irs interpretation disallowing the utilization of the nols and in august  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado seeking recovery of million in over payments that were previously denied by the irs  plus interest 
on july   the district court granted us summary judgment  concluding that the irs s decision disallowing the utilization of the nols was inappropriate 
the sole issue now before the district court is the amount of the tax refund to which we are entitled 
the irs is entitled to appeal the decision of the district court to grant the motion for summary judgment and we do not know whether the irs will do so or  if it does appeal  whether the appeal would be successful 
we are also a party to two related tax proceedings in the united states tax court regarding calculation of nol carryover deductions for tax years  and the two proceedings involve substantially the same issues as the litigation in the district court wherein we disagree with the irs as to the utilization of nols 
with respect to the case involving the tax year  a trial date has been set for november  but we expect that the case will be stayed pending final resolution of the district court case  which as described above  now only involves the determination of the tax refund to which we are entitled 
similarly  while no trial date has been set  we expect that we will stipulate with the irs that the case involving tax years and be stayed until the district court proceeding is resolved 
since the legal proceeding surrounding the utilization of the nols have not been fully resolved  including a determination of the amount of refund and the possibility that the district court s ruling may be appealed by the irs  there remains considerable uncertainty of what portion  if any  of the nols will be realized  and as such  we have not reflected any of the benefits of the utilization of the nols within our financial statements 
however  the range of potential reversal of other long term liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that would be recorded as a benefit to the company s income tax provision is between zero and million 
reconciliation of non gaap measures the following table reconciles from segment reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc in thousands year ended july  mountain reported ebitda lodging reported ebitda resort reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda total reported ebitda depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of fixed assets  net investment income  net interest expense  net asset impairment charge loss on extinguishment of debt income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to vail resorts  inc the following table reconciles net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents in thousands july  long term debt long term debt due within one year total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt liquidity and capital resources significant sources of cash historically  we have lower cash available as of our fiscal year end as well as at the end of our first fiscal quarter of each year as compared to our second and third fiscal quarter ends primarily due to the seasonality of our mountain segment operations 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing or mix of closings on and investment in real estate development projects 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of july   compared to million as of july  we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million and million generated during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we currently anticipate that resort reported ebitda will continue to provide a significant source of future operating cash flows combined with proceeds from the remaining inventory of real estate available for sale from the completed ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place at breckenridge projects 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents at july   we have available million under our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million which was amended and restated on january  key modifications to the credit agreement included  among other things  the extension of the maturity on the revolving credit facility from february to january  the expansion of baskets for improved flexibility in our ability to incur debt and make acquisitions  investments and distributions  and the elimination of certain financial covenants 
we believe the credit agreement  which matures in  provides adequate flexibility and is priced favorably with any new borrowings currently being priced at libor plus 
in addition  on april   we completed an offering for million of notes  the proceeds of which  along with available cash resources  were used to purchase the outstanding million principal amount of notes and pay related premiums  fees and expenses 
the notes were completely retired as of july  the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and will mature may  with no principal payments due until maturity 
we believe the notes will allow for substantially increased flexibility in our ability to incur debt and make acquisitions  investments and distributions 
fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  an increase of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the increase in operating cash flows was partially a result of an increase in the number of real estate closings that occurred in fiscal which generated million in net proceeds net of sales commissions compared to million generated in net proceeds net of sales commissions in fiscal additionally  investments in real estate decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as our real estate projects under development reached completion 
additionally  improvements in our resort operations  including from northstar at tahoe which was acquired in october  resulted in an increase in resort reported ebitda of million in fiscal compared to fiscal partially offsetting the above items were an increase in the change in accounts receivable and inventory of million partially due to the northstar at tahoe acquisition and a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to a reduction in real estate development payables 
cash used in investing activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the acquisition of northstar at tahoe in october for million net of cash assumed  an increase in resort capital expenditures of million in fiscal  and the prior year cash receipt of million primarily related to a land parcel we sold in fiscal  all of which was partially offset by the acquisition of mountain news corporation for million in fiscal cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in cash used in financing cash flows was primarily due to the repayment of million outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal  payment of financing costs associated with the offering of the notes and retirement of the notes and the amended and restated credit agreement of million  and cash dividends on common stock of million in fiscal the above was partially offset by the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv in the prior year for million on april  and the repurchase of common stock for million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  a decrease of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the decline in operating cash flows was primarily a result of increased real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions compared to real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions 
additionally  investments in real estate increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal further contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was the receipt of million of private club initiation fees for the vail mountain club in fiscal and a reduction in restricted cash of million in the fiscal which became available for general purpose use due to the payoff of our non recourse real estate financing 
partially offsetting the above items were improved operating cash flows from our resort operations of approximately million  a decrease in income tax payments of million and a decrease in the change in accounts receivable of and an increase in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in resort capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of cme for million in fiscal and the cash receipt of million primarily related to a land parcel we sold during fiscal  partially offset by the acquisition of mountain news for million in fiscal cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting from an increase in net borrowings under the credit agreement of million  the payoff of our non recourse real estate financings and scheduled debt maturity of million and million  respectively in fiscal and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of million during fiscal partially offsetting the above items was the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv for million on april  significant uses of cash our cash uses currently include providing for operating expenditures and capital expenditures for assets to be used in operations and to a substantially lesser degree remaining expenditures on completed real estate projects and future development projects 
we have historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for our resort operations  and we expect to continue to invest in the future 
current capital expenditure levels will primarily include investments that allow us to maintain our high quality standards  as well as certain incremental discretionary improvements at our six ski resorts  our retail rental business as well as throughout our owned lodging properties 
additionally  with the acquisition of northstar at tahoe to our ski resort portfolio  we are investing significantly in this resort property in the near term to enhance the guest experience 
we evaluate additional discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment 
we currently anticipate we will spend approximately million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar year excluding northstar at tahoe  and an additional million to million related to northstar at tahoe 
included in these capital expenditures are approximately million to million excluding northstar at tahoe  and an additional million to million related to northstar at tahoe  which are necessary to maintain appearance and level of service appropriate to our resort operations  including routine replacement of snow grooming equipment and rental fleet equipment 
approximately million was spent for capital expenditures  including northstar at tahoe  in calendar year as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar year discretionary expenditures for calendar include a new high speed chairlift to serve beaver creek mountain  a new on mountain fine dining restaurant at vail  development of significant new functionality for epic mix for use at all six of our resorts  renovations at certain owned lodging properties  expansion of terrain at northstar at tahoe  including a new high speed chairlift  a new on mountain dining venue at northstar at tahoe and renovation of the commercial village at northstar at tahoe to bring in a new tenant mix 
we currently plan to utilize cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit agreement and or cash flow generated from future operations to provide the cash necessary to execute our capital plans 
additionally  we do not expect to make any significant income tax payments for the remainder of calendar year due to accelerated tax deductions on capital expenditures that are expected to be placed in service by calendar year end combined with estimated tax losses generated from operations through calendar year end the company files its tax returns on a calendar year basis  subject to a settlement of the dispute with the irs over the utilization of nols previously discussed 
principal payments on the vast majority of our long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
as of july  and  total long term debt including long term debt due within one year was million and million  respectively  with the decrease at july  being primarily due to decreased net borrowings under the credit agreement 
net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents decreased from million as of july  to million as of july  due primarily to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and decreased net borrowings under our credit agreement 
our debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as we had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause our annual interest payments to change by approximately million 
the fluctuation in our debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under our credit agreement or other alternative financing arrangements we may enter into 
our long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
we can respond to liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic environment by managing our capital expenditures and the timing of new real estate development activity 
on march   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock and on july  approved an increase of our common stock repurchase authorization by an additional  shares 
during fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
since inception of this stock repurchase plan through july   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
as of july    shares remained available to repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under our employee share award plan 
acquisitions under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the timing as well as the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors  including our future financial performance  our available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future  the restrictions in our credit agreement and the indenture  dated as of april  among us  the guarantors therein and the bank of new york mellon trust company  na as trustee indenture  governing the notes  prevailing prices of our common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive 
the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time and is not expected to have a significant impact on our capitalization 
on june   our board of directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate estimated to be per share or million annually based upon shares outstanding as of july   subject to quarterly declaration  with the first quarterly dividend of per share paid on july  this dividend was funded through available cash on hand 
subject to the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law  we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  credit agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
covenants and limitations we must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants under our credit agreement and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit agreement covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit our ability to make certain restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit our ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets and incur certain indebtedness 
our borrowing availability under the credit agreement is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on our segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in our debt instruments as of july  we expect that we will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that we will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  construction agreements in conjunction with our development activities and lease agreements 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
obligations under construction contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until services and or goods are received which is in accordance with gaap 
additionally  operating lease and service contract obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments  as well as long term debt payments  included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   our annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  is anticipated to be approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for at least each of the next three years subsequent to fiscal the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt 
purchase obligations primarily include amounts which are classified as trade payables  real estate development payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes including taxes for uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received  including construction contracts not included on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  in accordance with gaap 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies which were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we also have other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate revenue and cost of sales description we utilize the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for condominium units sold within a project and or individual parcels of real estate  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
additionally  the determination of cost of sales associated with our mixed use real estate development projects may include estimates for the fair value of resort depreciable assets which are removed from project costs and separately capitalized and depreciated over their useful life 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either the relative sales values of the components of a project  which may include resort depreciable assets  or the total projected costs to be incurred to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels of real estate and or condominium units within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimate for the resort depreciable assets component of a project and a change in remaining costs to complete a project for which real estate sales and related cost of sales were recorded in fiscal would have changed the profit margin recognized by our real estate segment by approximately million for fiscal real estate held for sale and investment description we evaluate each real estate project on at least a quarterly basis to determine if indicators of potential impairment exist 
impairment indicators are assessed separately for each real estate project and include  but are not limited to current economic conditions  the local real estate market and the number and type of real estate units we have available for sale  expected selling prices  net margins on units closed in recent months and projected margins on remaining units that are available for sale 
a real estate project is considered impaired when its carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows the project is expected to generate 
judgments and uncertainties we determine the estimated cash flows by project starting with the current listing price of all units remaining to be sold by project which is then reduced by an estimate for sales discounts and concessions anticipated to be given to buyers over the remaining estimated sales period that takes into consideration the current economic environment  local real estate market and the type of real estate we have held for sale  marketing fees paid in conjunction with units to be sold  as applicable  estimated sales commissions and other closing costs including title  transfer and escrow fees  and estimated net carrying costs until units are sold  the sum of all which is compared to the carrying value for each individual real estate project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions based upon the analysis performed throughout fiscal  the estimated future cash flows of our real estate projects were in excess of their respective carrying values and as such no impairment charge has been recognized 
cash flows require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors such as the ultimate selling prices of individual units within a project and the estimated absorption period in which units are expected to be sold 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
for example  as of july   if our anticipated net cash proceeds after sales concessions  discounts  selling and closing costs on the remaining inventory of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place in breckenridge were to decline by compared to our current estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge on one or both of these projects 
goodwill and intangible assets description the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
judgments and uncertainties application of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
these analyses require significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  available industry market data to the extent available  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business including expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of the timing and degree of any economic recovery  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur including terminal multiples  determination of the respective weighted average cost of capital and market participant assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and allocate goodwill to our reporting units based on the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition generating the goodwill 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of may st of each year 
based upon our annual impairment test performed during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values and as such no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
however  we determined that certain reporting units within our lodging segment million of goodwill as of july  were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test  with the fair value of each of the reporting units estimated at approximately in excess of their carrying values and therefore are at risk for a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows  terminal value multiples and or weighted average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair values of our lodging segment reporting units may include such items as i a prolonged weakness in the general economic conditions in which the reporting units operate and therefore negatively impacting group and transient room nights and adr  ii an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and or degree  and iii volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in a higher discount rate 
while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
tax contingencies description we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which we may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and we have adequate reserves for our tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in our tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable  other long term liabilities and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture and fixtures  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are primarily depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or we could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our useful lives of the assets contain uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for fiscal new accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  we generally have been able to pass the increase on to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on our future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results our mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and our golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season results in operating losses 
revenue and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from certain managed hotel properties  certain other lodging properties and golf operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off season losses from our mountain and other lodging operations 
during fiscal  of total combined mountain and lodging segment net revenue excluding lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs was earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data unaudited  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   we had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing approximately of our total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would result in our annual interest payments changing by million 
our market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
