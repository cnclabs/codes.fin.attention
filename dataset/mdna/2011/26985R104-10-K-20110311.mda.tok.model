table of contents non gaap financial measures we include in this filing the following non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda as defined on page 
we provide reconciliations of this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measures as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus or minus income tax provision benefit  interest net  including realized interest rate risk management instruments and other expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  impairment expense  other operating expense  non recurring  other non cash operating and general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation related to our equity based compensation program  unrealized gains losses on commodity and interest rate risk management related instruments  gains losses on discontinued operations and other income expense 
we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of our core profitability to assess the financial performance of our assets 
adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental financial measure by external users of eagle rock financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts 
for example  eagle rock lenders under its revolving credit facility use a variant of eagle rock adjusted ebitda in a compliance covenant designed to measure the viability of eagle rock and its ability to perform under the terms of its revolving credit facility  eagle rock  therefore  uses adjusted ebitda to measure its compliance with its revolving credit facility 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management team uses in evaluating performance 
adjusted ebitda is useful in determining our ability to sustain or increase distributions 
by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  a non cash  mark to market benefit charge which represents the change in fair market value of our executed derivative instruments and is independent of our assets performance or cash flow generating ability  we believe adjusted ebitda reflects more accurately our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our level of indebtedness  make cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner and finance our maintenance capital expenditures 
we further believe that adjusted ebitda also describes more accurately the underlying performance of our operating assets by isolating the performance of our operating assets from the impact of an unrealized  non cash measure designed to describe the fluctuating inherent value of a financial asset 
similarly  by excluding the impact of non recurring discontinued operations  adjusted ebitda provides users of our financial statements a more accurate picture of our current assets cash generation ability  independently from that of assets which are no longer a part of our operations 
eagle rock adjusted ebitda definition may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures of other entities  as other entities may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner as eagle rock 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase puts or other similar floors despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a domestically focused  growth oriented  publicly traded delaware limited partnership engaged in the following two businesses midstream business gathering  compressing  treating  processing and transporting of natural gas  fractionating and transporting of natural gas liquids ngls  and the marketing of natural gas  condensate and ngls  and upstream business acquiring  developing and producing oil and natural gas property interests 
we report on our businesses in six accounting segments 
we conduct  evaluate and report on our midstream business within four distinct segments the texas panhandle segment  the east texas louisiana segment  the south texas segment and the gulf of mexico segment 
our texas panhandle segment consists of gathering and processing assets in the texas panhandle 
our east texas louisiana segment consists of gathering and processing assets in east texas northern louisiana 
our south texas segment consists of gathering systems and related compression and processing facilities in south texas  central texas  and west texas 
our gulf of mexico segment consists of gathering and processing assets in southern louisiana  the gulf of mexico and galveston bay 
during the year ended december   our midstream business generated operating income from continuing operations of million  compared to operating income from continuing operations of million generated during the year ended december   an increase of million 
in addition  during the year ended december   our midstream business incurred impairment charges of million  compared to million during the year ended december  we conduct  evaluate and report on our upstream business as one segment 
our upstream segment includes operated wells in escambia county  alabama as well as two treating facilities  one natural gas processing plant and related gathering systems 
the upstream segment also includes operated and non operated wells that are primarily located in west  east and south texas in ward  crane  pecos  henderson  rains  van zandt  limestone  freestone and atascosa counties 
during the year ended december   our upstream business generated operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million generated during the year ended december  of important note  our upstream business generated net revenue of million from the sale of sulfur during the year ended december   compared to expense of million during the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   our upstream business incurred impairment charges related to its unproved properties of million  compared to million for its proved properties during the year ended december  the final segment that we report on is our corporate segment  which is where we account for our commodity derivative hedging activity  intercompany eliminations and our general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   our corporate segment generated an operating loss of million compared to an operating loss of million generated during the year ended december  within these numbers were net losses  realized and unrealized  on commodity derivatives of million during the year ended december  compared to losses  realized and unrealized  on commodity derivatives of million during the year ended december  on may   as part of the recapitalization and related transactions discussed below  we sold our minerals business  which had been broken out as a separate segment in prior filings 
as a result of the sale  financial information related to the minerals business for has been classified as discontinued operations and financial information for previous years has been retrospectively adjusted to classify assets and liabilities as held for sale and operations as discontinued 
for a further discussion of the sale of our minerals business  see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item financial statement and supplementary data starting on page f of this annual report 

table of contents impairment for the years ended december   and  we determined that we needed to record an impairment charge for certain plants and pipelines within our midstream business and certain proved and unproved properties within our upstream business 
as a result  we incurred impairment charges during the year ended december  of i million in our south texas segment due to the termination of a significant gathering contract on our raymondville system  ii million due to an anticipated decline in volumes on our wildhorse gathering system within our south texas segment  iii million in our upstream segment related to certain fields in its unproved properties which we determined are not technologically feasible to develop and iv million of proved properties in our upstream segment due to adjustments to reserves 
during the year ended december   we determined that we needed to record an impairment charge for certain plants and pipelines within our midstream business and certain fields within our proved properties within our upstream segment 
as a result  we incurred impairment charges of i million in our midstream segment due to reduced throughput volumes as our producer customers curtailed their drilling activity in response to lower natural gas prices  and ii million in our upstream segment  of which  million was a result of a decline in natural gas prices  production declines and lower natural gas liquids yields at our flomaton field and million in other fields due to lower natural gas prices 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges related to certain processing plants  pipelines and contracts in its midstream business of million due to the substantial decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter as well as declining drilling activity by its producer customers and million in our upstream segment 
due to the impairment charge recorded in our upstream segment  we assessed our goodwill balance for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  our impairment analysis does not take into account the value of our commodity derivative instruments  which generally increase as the estimates of future prices decline 
further declines in commodity prices and other factors could result in additional impairment charges and changes to the fair value of our derivative instruments 
acquisitions historically  we have grown through acquisitions 
on september   we acquired certain additional interests in the big escambia creek  flomaton and fanny church fields in south alabama from indigo minerals  llc for million 
these interests are in wells in which we currently own a significant interest and are nearly operated by us 
on october   we acquired certain natural gas gathering systems and related facilities located primarily in wheeler and hemphill counties in the texas panhandle the east hemphill system from centerpoint energy field services  inc cefs 
the purchase price for the assets was million  subject to customary adjustments 
we did not make any acquisitions during the year ended december  refer to part i  item business table of acquisitions dispositions in the past five years for a history of acquisitions 
going forward  we will continue to assess acquisition opportunities for their potential accretive value 
our ability to complete acquisitions will depend on our ability to finance the acquisitions  either through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt under our credit facilities  on terms acceptable to us 
other matters unscheduled shut down of third party owned and operated eustace processing facility on august   the eustace processing facility  which processes substantially all of our east texas oil and gas production  was shut down due to events stemming from an electrical failure 
as a result  we were unable to produce from our east texas upstream properties from that date through the end of the year 
we estimate the shut down of the eustace facility impacted our upstream segment net revenues by approximately million in we recouped million of this loss in under our business interruption insurance  which was recognized as other revenue  and expect to recoup an additional million to reach the total maximum recovery of million under our business interruption insurance policy in the first quarter of on march   the third party operator of the eustace processing facility was in the process of returning the facility to service 

table of contents recent transactions recapitalization and related transactions on december   we announced that we  through certain of our affiliates  had entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of natural gas partners ngp and collectively with such affiliates  the ngp parties and black stone minerals company  lp to improve our liquidity and simplify our capital structure 
the definitive agreements included i a securities purchase and global transaction agreement  entered into between us and the ngp parties  including our general partner entities controlled by ngp  and ii a purchase and sale agreement the minerals business sale agreement  entered into between us and black stone for the sale of our minerals business 
the securities purchase and global transaction agreement was amended and restated on january  to allow for greater flexibility in the payment of the contemplated transaction fee to eagle rock holdings  lp holdings  which is controlled by ngp we refer to the amended securities purchase and global transaction agreement throughout this document as the global transaction agreement 
on may   a majority of our unitholders who are not affiliated with our general partner approved  among other things  the global transaction agreement  which contemplated a series of transactions that sought to simplify and recapitalize the partnership  including the simplification of our capital structure through the contribution  and resulting cancellation  of our incentive distribution rights and all  subordinated units held by holdings  which occurred on may   the sale of all of our fee mineral and royalty interests  as well as our equity investment in ivory working interests  lp collectively  the minerals business to black stone minerals company  lp  which was completed on may  and for which we received net proceeds of million 
we retained approximately million of cash received from net revenues received from the minerals business after the effective date of the sale  making our total proceeds from the sale of the minerals business since january   a rights offering  which was launched on june  and expired on june   and for which we received gross proceeds of million and issued  common units and warrants  the gp acquisition option  exercisable by the issuance of  newly issued common units to holdings  to capture the value of the controlling interest in us through a acquiring our general partner entities from holdings and immediately thereafter eliminating our  outstanding general partner units and b reconstituting our board to allow our common unitholders not affiliated with ngp to elect the majority of our directors 
on july   notice was given to holdings of our intention to exercise the gp acquisition option  and we closed the transaction on july  in connection with the completion of the gp acquisition option  our board of directors was expanded to include two additional independent directors who were appointed by the conflicts committee on july   and the obligation of ngp  at the sole discretion of our conflicts committee  to purchase up to million  at a price of per unit  of an eagle rock energy equity offering 
our conflicts committee determined that it was not in our best interests to require ngp to purchase equity at the per unit price  and the obligation expired on september  credit facility amendment on march   we entered into the second amendment the credit facility amendment to our credit agreement  dated as of december   with wachovia bank  na  bank of america  na  hsh nordbank ag  new york branch  the royal bank of scotland  plc  bnp paribas and the other lenders party thereto 
in connection with our unitholders approval of the global transaction agreement and related matters  the credit facility amendment became effective 
the credit facility amendment modified the definition of change in control in such a way that our exercise of the gp acquisition option did not trigger a change in control event and potential default  see general partner acquisition option 
in addition to modifying the definition of change in control  the credit facility amendment also reduced the maximum permitted senior secured leverage ratio as such term is defined in our credit agreement from to under the current credit agreement to to and from to to to for specified periods following certain permitted acquisitions 
the senior secured leverage ratio covenant is only relevant if we have unsecured senior or subordinated notes outstanding  
table of contents obligated us to use million of the proceeds from the sale of our minerals business described above to make a mandatory prepayment towards our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which mandatory prepayment was made on may   and reduced  upon such mandatory prepayment  our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility by the million amount of such mandatory prepayment  however  this did not impact our availability under our revolving credit facility because it is limited by compliance with financial covenants 
the credit facility amendment further clarified that the proceeds from the sale of our minerals business in excess of million may be used to immediately reduce debt  but did not result in a mandatory prepayment unless such proceeds were not reinvested in property as defined in our credit agreement within the day post closing period ie by february  provided in our credit agreement 
on may   we repaid an additional million towards our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility from proceeds from the sale of our minerals business 
we do not anticipate any further reductions in commitments under the credit facility resulting from the sale of the minerals business 
borrowing base redetermination on october   we announced that the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility  which relates to our upstream business  was set at million as part of our regularly scheduled semi annual borrowing base redetermination 
this was an increase from the million our borrowing base was set at during the april redetermination 
the redetermined borrowing base was effective october   with no additional fees or increase in interest rate spread incurred 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
we view these measurements as important factors affecting our profitability and review these measurements on a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis 
these measures include volumes  margin  operating expenses and adjusted ebitda defined on page 
on a company wide basis 
volumes by business midstream volumes 
in our midstream business  due to the natural production decline of the wells connected to our systems we must continually obtain new supplies of natural gas to maintain or increase throughput volumes on our gathering and processing systems in order to achieve our distribution objectives 
our ability to maintain existing supplies of natural gas and obtain new supplies is impacted by the level of workovers or recompletions of existing connected wells and successful drilling activity in areas currently dedicated to our pipelines  our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in other areas and our ability to obtain natural gas that has been released from other commitments 
we routinely monitor producer activity in the areas served by our gathering and processing systems to pursue new supply opportunities 
we rely on producer drilling activity to maintain and grow our midstream volumes 
generally  producer drilling activity is correlated to the current and expected price of natural gas  and to the current and expected price of crude oil in producing basins that have liquids rich gas reservoirs 
as such  throughput volume in our existing midstream assets will typically increase in times of rising gas prices and will typically decrease in times of falling gas prices  except that in liquids rich basins we may continue to experience a high level of drilling activity during periods when oil prices are high  even if gas prices are relatively low 
upstream volumes 
in the upstream segment  we continually monitor the production rates of the wells we operate 
this information is a critical indicator of the performance of our wells  and we evaluate and respond to any significant adverse changes 
we employ an experienced team of engineering and operations professionals to monitor these rates on a well by well basis and to design and implement remediation activities when necessary 
we also design and implement workover and drilling operations to increase production in order to offset the natural decline of our currently producing wells 
margin commodity pricing 
the margins in our midstream business generally are positively correlated to ngl and condensate prices  and may be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decline in relation to the price of natural gas 
we refer to the price of ngls in relation to the price of natural gas as the fractionation spread 
in our upstream segment  
table of contents increases in crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices will generally have a favorable impact on our revenues  conversely  decreases in crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices will generally unfavorably impact our revenue 
risk management 
we conduct risk management activities to mitigate the effect of commodity price and interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows 
our primary method of risk management in this respect is entering into derivative contracts 
the impact of our risk management activities are captured in our corporate segment 
for a further discussion of our risk management activities  see part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk operating expenses midstream operating expenses 
we monitor midstream operating expenses as a measure of the operating efficiency of our field operations 
direct labor  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses are largely independent of the volumes through our systems  but fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
upstream operating expenses 
we monitor and evaluate our upstream segment operating costs routinely  both on a total cost and unit cost basis 
many of the operating costs we incur are not directly related to the quantity of hydrocarbons that we produce  so we strive to maximize our production rates in order to improve our unit operating costs 
the most significant portion of our upstream segment operating costs is associated with the operation of the big escambia creek treating and processing facilities 
these facilities are overseen by members of our midstream engineering and operations staff 
the majority of the cost of operating these facilities is independent of their throughput 
this includes items such as labor  chemicals  utilities and materials 
adjusted ebitda see discussion of adjusted ebitda in part ii  item selected financial data 
general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends 
this expectation is based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us  however  our actual results may vary materially from our expectations 
although the global economic weakness that began in late and continued through has improved  we expect to continue to feel its effects for several years 
specifically  we expect relatively low economic growth in the united states and other developed economies and relatively high levels of unemployment 
we expect the current low interest rate environment to persist throughout and that credit will remain widely available 
however  we expect international sovereign credit concerns and domestic local and state credit concerns to continue to be a source of uncertainty in global credit markets 
we further believe that persistent unemployment and housing concerns of us consumers will result in sluggish domestic demand  and that business investment in capacity expansion will remain depressed until demand increases 
the issues of low demand and excess productive capacity may be worsened by fiscal austerity measures taken to address national budget deficits 
within the developing economies  we expect levels of growth to continue at pre recession levels 
in the case of china  many economists believe that its economy is growing at an annual rate of and showing signs of significant inflation 
we believe that the chinese government will take steps to attempt to reduce inflation  but that the factors that are influencing the high level of growth in the chinese economy will generally continue 
the increased demand for commodities that this growth is expected to cause has significant implications for commodity prices in general and for oil prices  in particular 
natural gas supply and demand natural gas prices are more dependent than crude oil prices on regional supply and demand due to the relative difficulty in transporting natural gas from producing to consuming regions of the world 
in the united states  where we produce natural gas  the outlook for natural gas demand has improved since the depths of the recession  but we do not expect significant increases in the demand for natural gas during over the longer term  however  we believe that the environmental advantages that natural gas has over coal will result in the construction of additional natural gas fired electricity generation capacity  both for new capacity and to replace aging coal fired facilities 
during  natural gas prices remained relatively low compared to the prices experienced prior to the recession 
our expectation was that these low prices would lead to reduced gas well drilling and lower natural gas supply  and that the resumption of growth in the united states economy would provide support to natural gas prices 
this has not yet occurred  
table of contents however  as operators continue to drill gas wells in emerging shale gas plays such as the haynesville  marcellus and eagle ford in order to place their leases into production before they expire 
in addition  producers have increased their drilling in liquids rich gas plays such as the granite wash and the eagle ford in order to extract the more valuable ngls from the raw gas stream 
we now expect that these plays will continue to provide a source of future natural gas supply for the next several years and expect prices to remain near their current level for some time 
in addition to north american drilling activity  imported liquefied natural gas lng has the potential to increase the supply of natural gas in the united states 
at the end of  lng imports were approximately bcf d which some forecasters previously predicted might increase to as much as bcf d in the next few years 
however  some of the large lng projects that are under construction to provide this supply are reported to have been delayed due to the global economic weakness  and the relatively low price of natural gas in the united states compared to other countries that import natural gas make a significant increase in lng imports in the us unlikely 
recently  there has been some speculation in the industry that the united states may begin to export lng 
crude oil supply  demand and outlook the majority of the world crude oil production and reserves is controlled by foreign governments and state owned oil companies 
many of these countries rely on crude oil exports to fund the majority of their governmental expenditures  and in some of these the export of crude oil represents the bulk of their economic output 
certain exporting countries have seen declines in their production rates due to low levels of capital re investment in their oil industry 
we believe that  while some oil exporting countries will be able to increase their production to meet future increases in demand  that others will have a difficult time maintaining their production levels and that this may result in an undersupplied market for crude oil within a few years 
there are several factors which influence the demand for crude oil  but ultimately the continued growth of the developing economies will result in much greater demand for crude oil 
it is uncertain how quickly demand will exceed supply  but we believe that crude oil prices may remain high relative to historical averages or further strengthen over the next one to two years 
natural gas liquids prices tend to have a high correlation to crude oil prices  especially for propane and heavier ngls  and we expect this trend to continue 
ethane prices historically have been less correlated to crude oil than have the heavier ngls 
ethane demand is primarily driven by global petrochemical production and specifically by its use as a feedstock for ethylene 
ethane low price relative to heavier ethylene feedstocks such as naptha has resulted in strong worldwide demand  and chemical manufacturers have recently announced projects to increase their ethylene production capacity using ethane 
we believe this trend will provide support to ethane prices throughout the increase in drilling activity focused on liquids rich areas  however  is projected to substantially increase the supply of ethane  which could result in downward pressure on ethane prices over the longer term 
sulfur supply  demand and outlook much of the natural gas that we produce in our upstream segment contains high  naturally occurring concentrations of hydrogen sulfide 
this is a corrosive  poisonous gas that must be removed from the natural gas stream before it can be processed for ngl extraction or sale 
the process of removing the hydrogen sulfide yields a large amount of elemental sulfur  which we sell or otherwise dispose of 
the process of removing hydrogen sulfide from natural gas  and similar processes for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from sour crude oils prior to refining  is the primary source of sulfur production in the united states and the world 
the primary use of sulfur is the production of sulfuric acid  and one of the major uses of sulfuric acid is the production of phosphoric acid 
phosphoric acid is a key raw material in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers 
therefore  one of the major factors influencing the demand for sulfur is the demand for fertilizer 
the region around tampa  florida contains a large amount of fertilizer manufacturing facilities  and tampa also serves as an export port for sulfur 
for many years  the supply of sulfur was greater than the available demand  such that tampa prices fluctuated within a narrow band of to per long ton 
depending on a seller proximity to tampa  transportation charges may have equaled or exceeded the selling price of the sulfur under this pricing environment 
beginning in the second half of  global demand for fertilizer increased significantly  and as a result  tampa prices also rose to record levels 
in late  sulfur prices at tampa peaked at over per long ton 
the global economic recession greatly reduced fertilizer demand  however  much of this demand has returned 
as with many commodities  the developing economies are responsible for much of this demand growth 
by the end of  tampa sulfur prices had fallen to zero dollars per long ton  and they remained low throughout by the first quarter of  prices had risen to per 
table of contents long ton and ended the year at over per long ton 
we expect demand to remain relatively strong in  but not as great as that in nevertheless  over the next few years  continued rapid growth in emerging economies could result in supply demand imbalances that could lead to the types of prices spikes we experienced in outlook for interest rates and inflation in response to the global recession which began in  the governments and central banks of the world large economies adopted fiscal and monetary policies that introduced unprecedented amounts of liquidity into their financial systems 
most of these efforts have been substantially completed and  other than certain monetary efforts in the united states  we believe it is unlikely that significant amounts of additional liquidity will be injected 
because these economies have excess productive capacity due to the reduction in demand caused by the recession  this liquidity has not led to inflationary pressures 
in addition  some of these economies have already begun  or are contemplating  tightening their fiscal policies 
this reduction in spending is also likely to reduce inflationary pressures 
eventually  however  as the economies recover and demand increases  policymakers will need to remove excess liquidity from their economies to avoid significant levels of inflation 
this will be a delicate task and will require a high degree of coordination among central banks 
it is impossible to predict when these policy changes will occur or how successful they will be 
in the near term  however  we expect that unemployment and underemployment will remain high  and this will act as a brake on inflation 
as inflationary pressures arise  however  we expect that one of the responses will be higher interest rates  and this could increase our interest expenses 
impact of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions the operations of and use of the products produced by the natural gas and oil industry are sources of emissions of certain greenhouse gases ghgs  namely carbon dioxide and methane 
regulation of ghg emissions has not had an impact on our operations in the past  and the regulation of our ghg emissions as such has not occurred 
however  there is a trend towards government imposed limitation of ghg emissions at the state  regional  and federal level 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  by virtue of a supreme court decision  was deemed to have authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other ghg emissions under the clean air act  and they are drafting and preparing to implement regulations 
it is possible that legislation will be proposed to amend the clean air act to exclude ghgs  although the probability of the enactment of such legislation is uncertain 
in addition  in there was a significant effort in the united states congress to enact legislation to establish a cap and trade system as a means to regulate ghg emissions 
a cap and trade bill was approved by the house of representatives  but was not approved in the senate 
given the house of representatives is now under control of the republican party which has historically opposed ghg regulation  the probability of of enactment of a cap and trade bill during the next two years at least is extremely low 
because of the uncertainty of the nature of any potential future federal ghg regulations at this time  we are unable to forecast how future regulation of ghg emissions would negatively impact our operations 
we will continue to monitor regulatory developments and to assess our ability to reasonably predict the economic impact of these developments on our business 
the commercial risk associated with the exploration and production of fossil fuels lies in the uncertainty of regulations that may affect our customers  which could affect the demand for crude oil and natural gas 
such an impact on demand could have an adverse impact on the demand for our services  and could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on the other hand  when burned  natural gas produces less greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels  such as refined petroleum products or coal 
as a result  climate change legislation or ghg emissions regulations could create an increased demand for natural gas 
critical accounting policies conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
on an ongoing basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments based on management best available knowledge of previous  current  and expected future events 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and estimates are subject to change due to modifications in the underlying conditions or assumptions 
currently  we do not foresee any reasonably likely changes to our 
table of contents current estimates and assumptions which would materially affect amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we have selected the following critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations for discussion 
successful efforts 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
leasehold costs are capitalized when incurred 
costs incurred to drill and complete development wells are capitalized 
unproved properties are assessed periodically within specific geographic areas and  if necessary  impairments are charged to expense 
geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
we carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well finds a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its capitalization as a producing well as long as we are making sufficient progress towards assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties is recorded based on units of production 
unit rates are computed for unamortized drilling and development costs using proved developed reserves and for acquisition costs using all proved reserves 
us gaap authoritative guidance requires that acquisition costs of proved properties be amortized on the basis of all proved reserves developed and undeveloped and that capitalized development costs wells and related equipment and facilities be amortized on the basis of proved developed reserves 
since our units of production depletion and amortization rate are a function of our proved reserves  we experience a higher depletion and amortization rate than we would if we claimed undeveloped or non producing reserves 
upon sale or retirement of complete fields of depreciable or depleted property  the book value thereof  less proceeds or salvage value  is charged or credited to income 
we assess proved oil and natural gas properties in our upstream segment for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be pre tax recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted pre tax future cash flows from a property are less than the carrying value 
if impairment is indicated  the fair value is compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record 
estimated future cash flows are based on management expectations for the future and include estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs 
downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of impairment charges in our upstream segment as a result of adjustments to our reserves 
during the year ended december   we incurred impairment charges of million in our upstream segment as a result of a decline in natural gas prices  production declines and lower natural gas liquids yields 
during the year ended december   we incurred impairment charges related to certain fields of million in our upstream segment due to the substantial decline in commodity prices during the fourth quarter of unproved properties that are individually insignificant are amortized 
unproved properties that are individually significant are assessed for impairment on a property by property basis 
if considered impaired  costs are charged to expense when such impairment is deemed to have occurred 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment charges for certain undrilled wells within our upstream segment unproved properties because we determined it would not be economical to develop these unproved locations 
our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic conditions 
annually  and on other occasions  cawley  gillespie associates  inc prepares an estimate of the proved reserves on all our properties  based on information provided by us 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
we prepare our reserve estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines 
the independent engineering firm described above adheres to the same guidelines when preparing their reserve reports 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 

table of contents our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil eventually recovered 
revenue and cost of goods sold recognition 
within our midstream and upstream businesses  sales of oil  natural gas  ngls and sulfur are recognized when their is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured 
in our midstream business  we record revenue and cost of goods sold on the gross basis for those transactions where we act as the principal and take title to natural gas  ngls or condensates that is purchased for resale 
our service related revenue is recognized in the period when the service is provided and includes our fee based service revenue for services such as transportation  compression  treating and processing 
risk management activities 
we have structured our hedging activities in order to minimize our commodity pricing and interest rate risks and to help maintain compliance with certain financial covenants in our revolving credit facility 
these hedging activities rely upon forecasts of our expected operations and financial structure over the next few years 
if our operations or financial structure are significantly different from these forecasts  we could be subject to adverse financial results as a result of these hedging activities 
we mitigate this potential exposure by retaining an operational cushion between our forecasted transactions and the level of hedging activity executed 
based on our current production estimates  we have hedged approximately of our expected hedgeable crude  condensate and natural gas liquids heavier than propane volumes and of our natural gas and ethane production 
similarly based on the production estimates in our current forecast  we have hedged approximately of our expected hedgeable crude  condensate and natural gas liquids heavier than propane volumes and of our natural gas and ethane production 
from the inception of our hedging program  we used mark to market accounting for our commodity hedges and interest rate swaps 
we record monthly realized gains and losses on hedge instruments based upon cash settlement information 
the settlement amounts vary due to the volatility in the commodity market prices throughout each month 
we also record unrealized gains and losses monthly based upon the future value on mark to market hedges through their expiration dates 
the expiration dates vary but are currently no later than december for our interest rate hedges and december for our commodity hedges 
option premiums and costs incurred to reset contract prices or purchase swaps are amortized during the contract period through the unrealized risk management instruments in total revenue 
we monitor and review hedging positions regularly 
depreciation expense and cost capitalization policies 
our midstream assets consist primarily of natural gas gathering pipelines and processing plants 
we capitalize all construction related direct labor and material costs  as well as indirect construction costs 
indirect construction costs include general engineering and the cost of funds used in construction 
the cost of funds used in construction represent capitalized interest 
these costs are then expensed over the life of the constructed asset through the recording of depreciation expense 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii
