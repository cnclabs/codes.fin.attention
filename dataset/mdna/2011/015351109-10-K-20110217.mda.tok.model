item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in thousands  except per share data in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this form k 
the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states  including those in the therapeutic areas of hematology  nephrology including transplant rejection  neurology  ophthalmology and cancer 
our marketed product soliris eculizumab is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh  an ultra rare and life threatening blood disorder 
we were incorporated in and began commercial sale of soliris in soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology  nephrology including transplant rejection  neurology and ophthalmology 
soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed 
the initial indication for which we received approval for soliris is pnh 
pnh is an ultra rare  debilitating and life threatening  acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells  or hemolysis 
the chronic hemolysis in patients with pnh may be associated with life threatening thromboses  recurrent pain  kidney disease  disabling fatigue  impaired quality of life  severe anemia  pulmonary hypertension  shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine hemoglobinuria 
soliris was approved by the us food and drug administration fda and the european commission ec in  by japan s ministry of health  labour and welfare mhlw in and has been approved in several other territories 
additionally  soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pnh in the united states  europe  japan and several other territories 
in  the fda and ec granted soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus  an ultra rare  inherited and life threatening complement inhibitor deficiency disease that often progresses to end stage kidney disease  kidney failure or death 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
table of contents contingent liabilities inventories research and development expenses share based compensation income taxes revenue recognition net product sales our principal source of revenue is product sales 
we have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue to date  our product sales have consisted solely of soliris 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer  which is typically a hospital  physician s office  private or government pharmacy or other health care facility 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  such as value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in the company s statements of operations and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
we also sell soliris to government agencies 
outside the united states  our customers are primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies  other health care providers and distributors 
in addition to sales in countries where soliris is commercially available  we have also recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs 
the relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales 
because of factors such as the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights  soliris customers generally carry limited inventory 
we monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales is required 
to date  actual refunds and returns have been negligible 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid in the united states and other programs outside the united states  as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require an analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months 
in march  united states government healthcare legislation  which contains several provisions that impact rebates payable  was enacted 
the provisions in the legislation which relate to rebates payable include an increase in the minimum medicaid rebate percentages  which is also extended as a discount to b institutions  and an extension of the medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to medicaid recipients 
we have recorded estimated rebates payable according to the new legislation 
if the provisions of this legislation change  we may revise our estimates of rebates payable  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made 

table of contents we have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended december   and as follows rebates payable balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  we record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue 
these costs are typically known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception 
we record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled 
contingent liabilities we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgement is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information 
as additional information becomes available  or upon specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
these revisions in these estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average cost method 
for products that are in initial clinical development  we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval  but subsequent to the filing of the biologics license application bla when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
we also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property  plant and equipment prior to approval of the facility by regulatory authorities 

table of contents we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may  after a period of time  no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  at which point we would adjust our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to realize the carrying value of our soliris inventory 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels  which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
research and development expenses we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
share based compensation we have one share based compensation plan known as the incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the share based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts 
table of contents and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance recorded against a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the united states  resulting in a tax benefit of  the decision to reverse the valuation allowance was made after management determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
we made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability  as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes  primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits 
we also reversed the valuation allowance recorded against certain non us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of where realization of those assets was now more likely than not 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where the realization is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
if we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period  we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period

cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris 
on january   novartis filed a civil action against alexion pharmaceuticals  inc and other biopharmaceuticals companies in the us district court for the district of delaware 
novartis claims willful infringement by alexion of us patent no 
 novartis seeks  among other things  monetary damages 
if it is finally determined that we infringe the novartis patent  we may be required to pay royalties to novartis on sales of soliris regarding certain manufacturing technology 
although we do not believe that the manufacture of soliris infringes a valid patent claim owned by novartis  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending against such action 
given the early stages of this litigation  management does not believe a loss related to this matter is probable and the potential magnitude of such loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
research and development expense our research and development expense includes personnel  facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates  as well as product development costs 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories external direct expenses and all other r d expenses 
external direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development  product development and discovery research 
clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates 
product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development and regulatory functions 
discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates 
clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs  while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products  our product development and our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been allocated directly to each program

substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended december  were related to two products  eculizumab and pexelizumab 
we obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of pnh in in the united states and european union  and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs 
we could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated

increase of  in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non pnh indications  offset by decreases in spending on pnh programs see table above 
increase of  in discovery research was primarily due to external research and consulting fees 
increase of  in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to depreciation on our rhode island manufacturing facility which placed into service in december we expect our research and development expenses to increase  at a lower rate than our revenue  in due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding eculizumab and samalizumab development programs  as well as expenses related to taligen and orphatec programs

the stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital  provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements  maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily attributable to the increase in product sales and the related cash generated from operations 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and inventory offset primarily by an increase in accrued expenses

the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material 
in january  we amended and restated our existing credit agreement to  among other things  increase our revolving credit facility by  the amended credit agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility  with up to a  sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes

we expect continued growth in our expenditures  particularly those related to research and product development  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  international expansion  commercialization of products and capital investment 
however  we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future

table of contents net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the  change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to increases in accounts receivable of  due to the increased number of patients treated with soliris globally  as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories 
additionally  the increase in inventory of  relates to increased production at our manufacturing facility in rhode island and resulting inventory buildup to support commercial growth 
these increases were offset by an increase of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which consists primarily of accrued royalties  payroll and taxes 
in  we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels  and the related cash collections  from soliris 
investing activities the components of cash flows from investing activities consisted of the following additions to property  plant and equipment were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in additions to property  plant and equipment was primarily as a result of the approval of our rhode island manufacturing facility by the ec in december through the approval date  we capitalized costs associated with the construction and validation of our rhode island manufacturing facility  and we ceased capitalization of these costs beginning in january purchases of marketable securities of  and sales of marketable securities of  for the year ended december  payments of  and  related to the final payment for the pdl biopharma patent settlement and oklahoma medical research foundation patent purchase agreement for the year ended december  in january and february  we completed business combinations of taligen and orphatec 
these acquisitions required us to make upfront payments of approximately  which we have paid from our available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
after these acquisitions  we continue to expect that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the upfront payments  these purchase agreements also include contingent payments totaling  for taligen and  for orphatec 
we do not expect that any contingent payments will be made in the next months and  accordingly  we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near term 
as future payments become more probable  we will evaluate methods of funding payments  which could be made from available cash  cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing 
financing activities net cash flows from financing activities reflected proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  cash from financing activities was reduced by a  prepayment on our mortgage loan 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years

the table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal  state and foreign income tax matters of  at december  the timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at december  we do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
we also did not include contingent payments related to the taligen and orphatec acquisitions  as the timing of payment for these amounts is not reasonably estimable at december  contingent payments for the business combinations total  for taligen and  for orphatec  and we do not expect to make any contingent payments in the next months 
convertible notes as of december   we had outstanding  principal amount of convertible senior notes due february  notes 
we pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on february and august of each year

the assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
the average interest rates on the above capital leases is and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease

we also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our on going activities 
in addition to the locations above  we also lease offices in certain countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization 
commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza sales ag 
lonza agreement we have a supply agreement with lonza sales ag relating to the manufacture of soliris  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by lonza  which depends upon our commercial requirements  the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of our smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility

these income tax credits expire between and due to the amount of our nol s and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate paying substantial us federal income taxes in the foreseeable future

we were again subject to the alternative minimum tax during and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term 
the payment of an alternative minimum tax amount generates a credit that may be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset our regular income tax liability 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of percent over a three year period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands  except per share data interest rate risk as of december   we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds  which are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
as of december   we held  in marketable securities with maturity dates of less than one year 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  we expect to hold time based investments  such as corporate bonds and commercial paper  through maturity 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately in the fair value of our cash and investments  which had a weighted average duration of approximately months at december  in january  we entered into a  amended and restated revolving credit facility  the amended credit agreement

we do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements 
foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and british pound against the us dollar 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables  and product sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we have substantial operations based in switzerland to support our business outside the us and canada  and accordingly  our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the swiss franc against the us dollar 
we currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet  using contracts with durations of up to days and hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales  using contracts with durations of up to months 
the objective of these programs is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues 
both programs utilize foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce  not eliminate  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
as of december   we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  as of december   our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities  we do not expect that a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets  which include our monetary assets and 
table of contents liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales
