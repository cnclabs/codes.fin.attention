item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed health care company focused on serving people who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs  including medicaid  children s health insurance program chip  medicaid expansion programs and medicare advantage 
we operate in one business segment with a single line of business 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
we believe that we are better qualified and positioned than many of our competitors to meet the unique needs of our members and the government agencies with whom we contract because of our focus solely on recipients of publicly funded health care  our medical management programs and community based education and outreach programs 
we design our programs to address the particular needs of our members  for whom we facilitate access to health care benefits pursuant to agreements with applicable state and federal government agencies 
we combine medical  social and behavioral health services to help our members obtain quality health care in an efficient manner 
our success in establishing and maintaining strong relationships with government agencies  providers and members has enabled us to obtain new contracts and to establish and maintain a leading market position in many of the markets we serve 
we continue to believe that managed health care remains the only proven mechanism that improves health outcomes for our members while helping our government customers manage the fiscal viability of their health care programs 
we are dedicated to offering real solutions that improve health care access and quality for our members  while proactively working to reduce the overall cost of care to taxpayers 
summary highlights for the year ended december  total revenues of billion  an increase over the year ended december   membership increased by  or  to  members compared to  members as of december   health benefits ratio hbr of of premium revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expense sg a ratio of of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   unregulated cash and investments of million as of december   on march   our tennessee health plan began providing long term care services to existing members under the state s newly created tenncare choices program  
table of contents on march   our new jersey health plan completed the previously announced acquisition of certain assets of university health plans  inc uhp 
as of december   we served approximately  members in new jersey  in may  the texas health and human services commission hhsc announced that our texas health plan was selected through a competitive procurement to expand health care coverage to seniors and people with disabilities in the six county service area surrounding fort worth  texas 
amerigroup texas  inc began serving approximately  star plus members in that service area on february   a portion of which were previously our members under an aso contract  and in september  our board of directors authorized a million increase to our ongoing share repurchase program  bringing the total authorization to million 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million and had remaining authorization to purchase up to an additional million of shares as of december  similar to our experience in  our results for the year ended december  reflect the impact of continued membership growth  which we believe is driven by the macroeconomic environment that has increased the number of medicaid eligible individuals 
increases in premium revenue also reflect the impact of a benefit expansion to provide long term care services to eligible members in tennessee  the net effect of premium rate changes from the prior year related to annual contract renewals and the impact of our first quarter acquisition in new jersey 
health benefits expense for the year ended december  reflects moderating cost trends for current and prior periods  the latter of which generated revisions of estimates related to prior periods 
health care reform on march   the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law and on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law collectively  the acts 
the acts provide comprehensive changes to the us health care system  which will be phased in at various stages over the next several years 
among other things  the acts are intended to provide health insurance to approximately million uninsured individuals of whom approximately million are expected to obtain health insurance through the expansion of the medicaid program beginning in funding for the expanded coverage will initially come largely from the federal government 
the acts did not have a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity or cash flows in  however  we are currently evaluating the provisions of the acts and believe that the acts may provide us with significant opportunities for membership growth in our existing markets and  potentially  in new markets in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will realize this growth  or that this growth will be profitable 
further  there are several pending lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the acts so there can be no assurance that the acts will take effect as originally enacted or at all 
there are numerous steps required to implement the acts  including promulgating a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous regulations that may affect our business 
further  there is resistance to expansion at the state level  largely due to budgetary pressure 
because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them  we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect that any future legislation or regulation  or even the pending litigation challenging the acts  will have on our business or our growth opportunities 
although we believe the acts will provide us with significant opportunity  the enacted reforms  as well as future regulations  legislative changes and judicial decisions may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the acts also include the imposition of a significant new non deductible federal premium based assessment and other assessments on health insurers 
if this federal premium based assessment is imposed as enacted  and if the cost of the federal premium based assessment is not included in the calculation of our premium rates  or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment  our results of operations  financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents business strategy we have a disciplined approach to evaluating the operating performance of our existing markets to determine whether to exit or continue operating in each market 
as a result  in the past we have and may in the future decide to exit certain markets if they do not meet our long term business goals 
we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities to determine if they align with our business strategy 
we continue to believe acquisitions can be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
opportunities for future membership growth medicare advantage in june  we received approval from the centers for medicare medicaid services cms to add tarrant county to our medicare advantage service area in texas  and to add rutherford county to our medicare advantage service area in tennessee 
in addition  cms approved expansion of our medicare advantage plans to cover traditional medicare beneficiaries in addition to the existing special needs beneficiaries already covered in texas  tennessee and new mexico 
these approvals allowed us to begin serving medicare members in the expanded areas effective january  we can give no assurance that our entry into these service areas will be favorable to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
texas in may  hhsc announced that our texas health plan was selected through a competitive procurement to expand health care coverage to seniors and people with disabilities in the six county service area surrounding fort worth  texas 
amerigroup texas  inc began serving approximately  star plus members in that service area on february   a portion of which were previously our members under an aso contract 
we are one of two health plans awarded this expansion contract  however we are currently serving all star plus members in the fort worth market while the other health plan completes its readiness review 
if and when that second plan becomes operational  the members will be provided the opportunity to choose between health plans 
hhsc is currently drafting a request for proposal rfp for the re bid of its entire managed care program in the state of texas 
we expect the rfp to include the addition of new service areas and new product opportunities in existing service areas  resulting in a significant increase to the size and scope of the state s managed care program 
we anticipate that the release of the rfp and hhsc s selection of vendors under the new contract will occur sometime in with details regarding implementation dates dependent on the timing of the award 
if we are not awarded this contract through the re bidding process  our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods could be materially and adversely affected 
georgia our temporary assistance for needy families tanf and chip contract with the state of georgia expires june   with the state s option to renew the contract for one additional one year term 
the state has notified us of its intent to renew our contract effective july  and to amend our existing contract to include an option to renew for two additional one year terms 
other market updates tennessee on march   our tennessee health plan began offering long term care services to existing members through the state s tenncare choices program 
the program  created as a result of the long term care community choices act of  is an expansion program offered through amendments to existing medicaid managed care contracts 
tenncare choices focuses on promoting independence  choice  dignity and quality of life for long term care medicaid managed care recipients by offering members the option to live in their own homes while receiving long term care and other medical services 

table of contents new jersey on march   our new jersey health plan completed the previously announced acquisition of the medicaid contract rights and rights under certain provider agreements of uhp for million 
at december   we served approximately  members in the state of new jersey 
contingencies florida medicaid contract dispute under the terms of the medicaid contracts with the florida agency for health care administration ahca  managed care organizations are required to have a process to identify members who are pregnant  or the newborns of members  so that the newborn can be enrolled as a member of the health plan as soon as possible after birth 
this process is referred to as the unborn activation process 
beginning in july  amerigroup florida  inc received a series of letters from the florida office of the inspector general ig and ahca stating that amerigroup florida  inc had failed to comply with the unborn activation process in each and every instance during the period from july  through december  and  as a result  ahca had paid approximately million in medicaid fee for service claims that should have been paid by amerigroup florida  inc the letters requested that amerigroup florida  inc provide documentation to evidence its compliance with the terms of the contract with ahca with respect to the unborn activation process 
it is our belief that ahca and the ig sent similar letters to the other florida medicaid managed care organizations during this time period 
in october  amerigroup florida  inc submitted its response to the letters 
in july  amerigroup florida  inc received another series of letters from the ig and ahca stating that  based on a review of the amerigroup florida  inc s response  they had determined that amerigroup florida  inc did not comply with the unborn activation process and assessed fines against amerigroup florida  inc in the amount of two thousand  five hundred dollars per newborn for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
the letters further reserved ahca s right to pursue collection of the amount paid for the fee for service claims 
amerigroup florida  inc appealed these findings and submitted documentation to evidence its compliance with  and performance under  the unborn activation process requirements of the contract 
on january   amerigroup florida  inc appealed ahca s contract interpretation to the florida deputy secretary of medicaid that the failure to utilize the unborn activation process for each and every newborn could result in fines 
in february  amerigroup florida  inc received another series of letters from the ig and ahca revising the damages from million to million for the fee for service claims that ahca believed they paid 
the revised damages included an offset of premiums that would have been paid for the dates of service covered by the claims 
the letters also included an updated fine amount which was not materially different from the prior letters 
on may   the florida deputy secretary of medicaid denied amerigroup florida  inc s contract interpretation appeal 
following the denial  in june  amerigroup florida  inc received another series of letters from ahca assessing fines in the amount of two thousand  five hundred dollars per newborn for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
as a result of discussions with the ig and ahca  in december  amerigroup florida  inc and ahca entered into a confidential settlement agreement resolving and releasing all claims related to the unborn activation process during the period from july  through december  the settlement  which is included in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  was not material to our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
georgia letter of credit effective july   we renewed a collateralized irrevocable standby letter of credit  initially issued on july  in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million  to meet certain obligations under our medicaid contract in the state of georgia through our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc the letter of credit is collateralized through cash held by amgp georgia managed care company  inc 
table of contents legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based upon our evaluation of the information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect  either individually or in the aggregate  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we have been involved in specific litigation in the current year  the details of which are disclosed in part i  item legal proceedings 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums and administrative services only aso fees we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health care services for our tanf  chip  aged  blind and disabled abd and familycare members 
we receive premiums from cms for our medicare advantage members 
we recognize premium and aso fee revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed amount per member per month pmpm is paid to us to arrange for health care services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government agencies with whom we contract 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative revenue adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
adjustments to eligibility data received from these government agencies result from retroactive application of enrollment or disenrollment of members or classification changes of members between rate categories that were not known by us in previous months due to timing of the receipt of data or errors in processing by the government agencies 
these changes  while common  are not generally large 
retroactive adjustments to revenue for corrections in eligibility data are recorded in the period in which the information becomes known 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate 
in all of the states in which we operate  with the exceptions of florida  new mexico  tennessee and virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments to offset the health benefits expense associated with the birth of a baby 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are collectible 
upon delivery of a baby  each state is notified in accordance with contract terms 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for those services 
changes in authorization and claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues can occur as a result of changes in eligibility noted above or corrections of errors in the underlying data 
adjustments to revenue for corrections to authorization and claims data are recorded in the period in which the corrections become known 
historically  the impact of adjustments from retroactivity  changes in authorizations and changes in claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues has represented less than of annual revenue 
this results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
additionally  delays in annual premium rate changes require that we defer the recognition of any increases to the period in which the premium rates become final 
the time lag between the effective date of the premium rate increase and the final contract can and has been delayed one quarter or more 
the value of the impact can be significant in the period in which it is recognized dependent on the magnitude of the premium rate change  the membership to which it applies and the length of the delay between the effective date and the final contract date 

table of contents estimating health benefits expense and claims payable medical claims payable  representing of our total consolidated liabilities as of december   consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported ibnr 
included in this liability and the corresponding health benefits expense for ibnr claims are the estimated costs of processing such claims 
health benefits expense has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical claims payable since inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
in developing our medical claims payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for mature incurred months generally the months prior to the most recent three months  we calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the date of estimation 
we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of ultimate incurred claims 
we do not believe that completion factors are fully credible for estimating claims incurred for the most recent two to three months which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical claims payable 
accordingly  we estimate health benefits expense incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to medical costs incurred in a more complete time period 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available 
assumptions for known changes in hospital authorization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  age and gender mix of members  and seasonality are also incorporated into the most recent incurred estimates 
the incurred estimates resulting from the analysis of completion factors  medical cost trend factors and other known changes are weighted together using actuarial judgment 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  new flu strains  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our members in our assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated  as opposed to a fee for service  basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical cost trend 
other external factors that may impact medical cost trends include factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics  such as the hn pandemic  or increases in membership that contribute to an increase in outpatient costs 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately establish estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of health benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 

table of contents completion factors and medical cost trends are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical claims payable estimates 
the following tables illustrate the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in medical claims trend increase decrease in decrease increase in factor medical claims payable increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expense and medical claims payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expense and medical claims payable caused by changes in medical costs trend data used in developing medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating our medical claims payable 
changes in estimates of medical claims payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submission and our payment processes often results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
deviations  whether positive or negative  between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known 
we continually monitor and adjust the medical claims payable and health benefits expense based on subsequent paid claims activity 
if it is determined that our assumptions regarding medical cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results  our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be impacted in future periods 
adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional health benefits expense or a reduction of health benefits expense in the period an adjustment is made 
further  due to the considerable variability of health care costs  adjustments to medical claims payable occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter 
prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuaries judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims payable for the three years ended december in thousands medical claims payable as of january health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year health benefits expenses incurred health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of prior year medical claims payable as of december health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of the prior year s health benefits expenses related to current year health benefits expense incurred during the year  was reduced by approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  for amounts related to prior years 
as noted above  the actuarial standards of practice generally require that the liabilities established for ibnr be sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
we did not experience moderately adverse conditions in any of these periods 
therefore  included in the amounts related to prior years are approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to amounts included in the medical claims payable as of january of each respective year in order to establish the liability at a level adequate for moderately adverse conditions 
the remaining reduction in health benefits expense incurred during the year  related to prior years  of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily resulted from obtaining more complete claims information for claims incurred for dates of service in the prior years 
we refer to these amounts as net reserve development 
we experienced lower medical trend than originally estimated due to moderating medical trends lower than previously estimated and to claims processing initiatives that yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits in  and related to prior year dates of services for all periods 
these factors also caused our actuarial estimates to include faster completion factors than were originally established 
the faster completion factors contributed to the net favorable reserve development in each respective period 
establishing the liabilities for ibnr associated with health benefits expense incurred during a year related to that current year  at a level sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  will cause incurred health benefits expense for that current year to be higher than if ibnr was established without sufficiency for moderately adverse conditions 
in the above table  the health benefits expense incurred during the year related to the current year includes an assumption to cover moderately adverse conditions 
also included in medical claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
these estimates are established through analysis of claims payment 
table of contents data  contractual provisions and state or federal regulations  as applicable 
differences in interpretation of appropriate payment levels and the methods under which these liabilities are resolved cause these estimates to be subject to revision in future periods 
premium deficiency reserves in addition to incurred but not paid claims  the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies  if appropriate 
we review each state medicaid and federal medicare contract under which we operate on a quarterly basis for any apparent premium deficiency 
in doing so  we evaluate current medical cost trends  expected premium rate changes and termination clauses to determine our exposure to future losses  if any 
premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and investment income on existing medical insurance contracts 
for purposes of premium deficiencies  contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring  servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts 
we did not have any premium deficiency reserves at december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with current accounting guidance as prescribed under us generally accepted accounting principles 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability based on enacted tax rates  estimates of book to tax differences in income  and projections of income that will be earned in each taxing jurisdiction 
deferred tax assets and liabilities representing the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting net income and taxable income are measured at the tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded 
after tax returns for the applicable year are filed  the estimated tax liability is adjusted to the actual liability per the filed state and federal tax returns 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates of tax liability and our actual tax liability 
similar to other companies  we sometimes face challenges from the tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
positions taken on our tax returns are evaluated and benefits are recognized only if it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained on audit 
based on our evaluation of tax positions  we believe that we have appropriately accounted for potential tax exposures 
in addition  we are periodically audited by state and federal taxing authorities and these audits can result in proposed assessments 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and  as such  will vigorously defend these positions on audit 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
although the ultimate resolution of these audits may require additional tax payments  we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings 
the qui tam litigation settlement payment we made in had a significant impact on tax expense and the effective tax rates for and due to the fact that a portion of the settlement payment is not deductible for income tax purposes 
at december   the estimated tax benefit associated with the qui tam litigation settlement payment was approximately million 
in june  we recorded an additional million tax benefit regarding the tax treatment of the qui tam litigation settlement under an agreement in principle with the internal revenue service irs which was formalized through a pre filing agreement with the irs in september the pre filing agreement program permits taxpayers to resolve tax issues in advance of filing their corporate income tax returns 
we do not anticipate that there will be any further material changes to the tax benefit associated with this litigation settlement in future periods 
for further information  please reference note to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in item of this form k 
investments as of december   we had investments with a carrying value of million  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report unrealized 
table of contents gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in stockholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost 
for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other causes  which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
as of december   our investments included securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities issued by student loan corporations established by various state governments 
since early  auctions for these auction rate securities have failed  significantly decreasing our ability to liquidate these securities prior to maturity 
as we cannot predict the timing of future successful auctions  if any  our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value within long term investments 
we currently believe that the net unrealized loss position that remains at december  on our auction rate securities portfolio is primarily due to liquidity concerns and not the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers 
we currently have the intent to hold our auction rate securities to maturity  if required  or if and when market stability is restored with respect to these investments 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at acquisition requires assumptions regarding estimated discounted cash flows and market analyses 
these assumptions contain uncertainties because they require management to use judgment in selecting the assumptions and applying the market analyses to the individual acquisitions 
additionally  impairment evaluations require management to use judgment to determine if impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is apparent 
we have applied a consistent methodology in both the original valuation and subsequent impairment evaluations for all goodwill and intangible assets 
we do not anticipate any changes to that methodology  nor has any impairment loss resulted from our analyses other than that recognized in connection with discontinued operations in west tennessee and the district of columbia in based on our analysis  we have concluded that a significant margin of fair value in excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles exists as of december  if the assumptions used to evaluate the value of goodwill and intangible assets change in the future  an impairment loss may be recorded and it could be material to our results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss occurs

table of contents revenues premium revenue premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to billion from billion for the year ended december  premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  from billion for the year ended december  the increase in both periods was due in part to significant increases in full risk membership across the majority of our existing products and markets 
these membership increases are partially due to continuing high levels of unemployment and the generally adverse macroeconomic environment driving increases in the number of people eligible for publicly funded health care programs 
we expect membership increases to continue into at moderating levels 
premium revenue for the year ended december  also increased as a result of our entry into the tennessee tenncare choices program and our acquisition of the medicaid contract rights from uhp in the state of new jersey  both occurring in march  as well as from premium rate and mix changes 
these increases were offset in part by our decision to exit the abd program in the southwest region of ohio as well as the state s election to remove pharmacy coverage from the benefit package  both effective february premium revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  also increased as a result of our completion of a full statewide rollout under new mexico s coordination of long term services colts program in april  which began with six counties in august  as well as our entry into the nevada market in february the following table sets forth the approximate number of members we served in each state as of december   and because we receive two premiums for members that are in both the medicare advantage and medicaid products  these members have been counted twice in the states where we operate medicare advantage plans

table of contents risk membership as of december  increased by  members  or  from  as of december  the increase in both periods was primarily a result of membership growth in the majority of our products and markets driven by a surge in medicaid eligibility  which we believe was driven by high unemployment and general adverse economic conditions 
membership as of december  also increased as a result of our march acquisition of the medicaid contract rights from uhp to provide services to additional members in the state of new jersey 
membership as of december  also increased as a result of our entry into the nevada market in february and the commencement of the colts program in new mexico in august at december   we served members who received health care benefits through contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for the year ended december   our texas contract represented approximately of premium revenues and our tennessee  georgia and maryland contracts represented approximately   and of premium revenues  respectively 
our state contracts have terms that are generally one to two years in length  some of which contain optional renewal periods at the discretion of the individual states 
some contracts also contain a termination clause with notification periods ranging from to days 
at the termination of these contracts  re negotiation of terms or the requirement to enter into a re bidding or reprocurement process is required to execute a new contract 
if these contracts were not renewed on favorable terms to us  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
investment income and other our investment portfolio generated approximately million  million and million in pre tax income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in each period is primarily a result of decreasing rates of return on fixed income securities due to current market interest rates 
we anticipate that our effective yield will remain at or below the current rate as of december  for the foreseeable future  which will result in similar or reduced returns on our investment portfolio in future periods 
the performance of our investment portfolio is interest rate driven and  consequently  changes in interest rates affect our returns on  and the fair value of  our portfolio which can materially affect our results of operations or liquidity in future periods 
other revenue for the year ended december   decreased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  other revenue for the year ended december  decreased million from million for the year ended december  included in other revenue for the year ended december  is a million gain on the sale of certain trademarks

the decrease in health benefits expense as it compares to premium revenue for the year ended december  resulted primarily from moderating cost trends for current and prior periods  the latter of which generated revisions of estimates related to prior periods 
in addition  we believe a less severe winter flu season and lower utilization of health services due to severe winter weather in some of our markets favorably impacted the ratio 
hbr was also favorably impacted by the net effect of premium rate changes in connection with annual contract renewals 
expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or compared to that for the year ended december  the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in our results compared to reflect an increase in the hbr primarily as a result of increased outpatient costs experienced across the majority of our markets and membership base 
the surge in membership in resulted in increased utilization and intensity of services  particularly as it relates to 
table of contents emergency room services  ambulatory services and physician services 
historical experience indicates that new members generally utilize more services during the first two months of enrollment 
our results also reflect a significant increase in flu related costs directly related to the onset of a severe off season flu outbreak associated with the hn virus  which has been noted to be particularly virulent among children  pregnant women  and other high risk populations  all of whom together represent a significant portion of our membership 
additionally  our entry into the new mexico market  with a higher hbr due to the benefit structure of the colts program  contributed to the increase in hbr overall 
in total  the increases in health benefits expense exceeded growth in premium revenues  thereby negatively impacting hbr for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our sg a to total revenues ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in sg a is primarily a result of increased salary and benefits expenses due to increased variable compensation accruals as a result of our operating performance for as well as moderate wage  benefits and workforce increases over the prior year 
our sg a ratio remained relatively stable as the increased expense levels were matched by leverage gained through increased premium revenues 
sg a decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to our sg a to total revenues ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in the sg a ratio in compared to is primarily a result of reductions in salary and benefits expenses due to lower variable compensation accruals related to our operating results in the decrease in the sg a ratio is also the result of leverage gained through an increase in premium revenue through new market expansion and existing market growth and the termination of our aso contract in west tennessee in october premium tax expense premium taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is attributable to increased premium revenues in the state of tennessee primarily as a result of our entry into the tenncare choices program in march and a premium tax rate increase in tennessee effective july additionally  premium revenue growth in the majority of other markets where premium tax is levied contributed to the increase 
these factors were partially offset by the termination of premium tax in the state of georgia in october which was subsequently reinstated at a lower rate in july premium taxes increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is a result of the commencement of the colts program in new mexico in august  entry into nevada in february  adoption of premium tax in the state of new york effective january  a premium tax rate increase in tennessee effective july and growth in premium revenues across all markets where premium tax is levied 
these increases were partially offset by the suspension of premium tax in the state of georgia in october litigation settlement on august   we settled a qui tam litigation relating to certain marketing practices of our former illinois health plan for a cash payment of million without any admission of wrong doing by us  our subsidiaries or affiliates 
we also paid approximately million to the relator for legal fees 
both payments were made during the three months ended september  as a result  we recorded a one time expense in the amount of million  or million net of the related tax effects  in the year ended december  and reported a net loss 
in june  we recorded a million tax benefit regarding the tax treatment of the settlement under an agreement in principle with the irs which was formalized through a pre filing agreement with the irs in september the pre filing agreement program permits taxpayers to resolve tax issues in advance of filing their corporate income tax returns 
we do not anticipate that there will be any further material changes to the tax benefit associated with this settlement in future periods 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases are the result of scheduled and voluntary payments resulting in payment in full of all outstanding balances under our previously maintained credit agreement which we terminated in august  as well as fluctuating interest rates for previous borrowings under the credit agreement 
provision for income taxes income tax expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was significantly decreased due to a pre filing agreement reached with the irs in regarding the tax treatment of the qui tam litigation settlement payment resulting in an additional tax benefit of million over what was recorded in excluding the impact of the pre filing agreement  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased as a result of increases in non deductible expenses as well as an increase in the blended state income tax rate 
additionally  excluding the impact of the tax benefits relating to the pre filing agreement in and the settlement payment in  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  due to a decrease in the blended state income tax rate 
net income loss net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in and a net loss of million  or per diluted share in net income increased from to primarily as a result of moderating cost trends for current and prior periods  the latter of which generated revisions of estimates related to prior periods 
the increase was also a result of premium growth  primarily driven by membership growth  expansion into the tenncare choices program in the state of tennessee  premium rate and mix changes  and our acquisition of the medicaid contract rights from uhp in the state of new jersey  each without an equal increase in health benefits expense 
net income increased from to primarily as a result of the one time expense recorded in in connection with the settlement of the qui tam litigation equal to million before the related tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments which are unregulated totaled million at december  financing activities convertible senior notes as of december   we had million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due may  the convertible senior notes are governed by an indenture dated as of march  the indenture 
the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to all of our subordinated debt 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year and mature on may   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with the indenture 

table of contents upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the convertible senior notes converted 
with respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount  we have the option to settle the excess with cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof based on a daily conversion value  as defined in the indenture 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is shares of common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of convertible senior notes  which represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on march  and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
consequently  under the provisions of the convertible senior notes  if the market price of our common stock exceeds we will be obligated to settle  in cash or shares of our common stock at our option  an amount equal to approximately million for each dollar in share price that the market price of our common stock exceeds  or the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes 
in periods prior to conversion  the convertible senior notes would also have a dilutive impact to earnings if the average market price of our common stock exceeds for the period reported 
at conversion  the dilutive impact would result if the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes  if any  is settled in shares of our common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
in addition  if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date  we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of convertible senior notes that elects to convert their convertible senior notes in connection with such fundamental change 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased convertible note hedges covering  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the convertible note hedges  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedges 
consequently  under the provisions of the convertible note hedges  we are entitled to receive cash or shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes from the counterparty to the convertible note hedges 
also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we sold warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the settlement date exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled in shares of our common stock 
consequently  under the provisions of the warrant instruments  if the market price of our common stock exceeds at exercise we will be obligated to settle in shares of our common stock an amount equal to approximately million for each dollar in share price that the market price of our common stock exceeds resulting in a dilutive impact to our earnings 
in periods prior to exercise  the warrant instruments would also have a dilutive impact to earnings if the average market price of our common stock exceeds for the period reported 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are separate transactions which do not affect holders rights under the convertible senior notes 
universal automatic shelf registration on december   we filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which enables us to sell  in one or more public offerings  common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the applicable offering 
the shelf registration provides us with the flexibility to publicly offer and sell securities at times we believe market conditions make such an offering attractive 
because we are a well known seasoned issuer  the shelf registration statement was effective upon filing 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
share repurchase program under the authorization of our board of directors  we maintain an ongoing share repurchase program 
on september   the board of directors authorized a million increase to the ongoing share repurchase program  bringing the total authorization to million 
the million authorization is for repurchases of 
table of contents our common stock made from and after august  pursuant to this ongoing share repurchase program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock and placed them into treasury during the year ended december  at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   we had remaining authorization to purchase up to an additional million of shares of the company s common stock under the ongoing share repurchase program 
credit agreement we previously maintained a credit agreement that provided both a secured term loan and a senior secured revolving credit facility 
on july   we paid the remaining balance of the secured term loan 
effective august   we terminated the credit agreement and related pledge and security agreement 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of the effective date of termination 
cash and investments cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows was primarily a result of an increase in net income due to premium revenue growth across the majority of our existing products and markets as well as moderating cost trends for current and prior periods and an increase in cash flows generated from working capital changes 
cash flows generated from working capital changes was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities for working capital changes of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by working capital changes primarily resulted from a net increase in cash provided through changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses  contractual refunds payable and other current liabilities of million primarily due to fluctuations in variable compensation accruals which are directly related to our achievement of financial performance goals and changes in the experience rebate accrual under our contract with the state of texas 
the increase in cash provided by working capital changes is further attributable to variability in the timing of receipts of premium from government agencies 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities is due primarily to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   partially offset by our acquisition of the medicaid contract rights from uhp for million in march we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for to be between approximately million and million related primarily to technological infrastructure development and enhancement of core systems to increase scalability and efficiency 
our investment policies are designed to preserve capital  provide liquidity and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with a weighted average maturity of approximately twenty two months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  debt securities of government sponsored entities  federally insured corporate bonds  money market funds  municipal bonds and us treasury securities 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on consolidated investments as of december  was approximately 
as of december   we had total cash and investments of approximately billion 

table of contents the following table shows the types  percentages and average standard and poor s s p ratings of our holdings within our investment portfolio at december  portfolio average s p percentage rating auction rate securities aaa cash  bank deposits and commercial paper aaa certificates of deposit aaa corporate bonds a debt obligations of government sponsored entities  federally insured corporate bonds and us treasury securities aaa money market funds aaa municipal bonds aa aa as of december   million of our investments were comprised of auction rate securities issued by student loan corporations established by various state governments 
since early  auctions for these auction rate securities have failed  significantly decreasing our ability to liquidate these securities prior to maturity 
as we cannot predict the timing of future successful auctions  if any  our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value within long term investments 
the weighted average life of our auction rate securities portfolio  based on the final maturity  is approximately twenty two years 
we currently believe that the million net unrealized loss position that remains at december  on our auction rate securities portfolio is primarily due to liquidity concerns and not the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers 
we currently have the intent to hold our auction rate securities to maturity  if required  or if and when market stability is restored with respect to these investments 
during the year ended december   certain investments in auction rate securities were sold or called for net proceeds of million  resulting in a million net realized gain recorded in earnings  excluding the loss on the forward contract expiration of million related to certain sales of auction rate securities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repayments during of million of borrowings under our previously maintained credit agreement  which was terminated effective august  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was further attributable to an increase in the change in bank overdrafts of million and an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases of million  partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock of million 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months 
our debt to total capital ratio at december  was 
we utilize the debt to total capital ratio as a measure  among others  of our leverage and financial flexibility 
we believe our current debt to total capital ratio allows us flexibility to access debt financing should the need or opportunity arise  however the financial markets have experienced periods of volatility and disruption 
future volatility and disruption is possible and unpredictable 
in the event we need access to additional capital  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital will depend on the market condition and our financial position at the time we pursue additional financing 
the principal of our convertible senior notes may be repaid with proceeds from debt or equity financing  existing cash and investments  or a combination thereof 
if we determine that debt or equity financing is appropriate  our access to these markets may be limited as our results of operations cannot be predicted 
additionally  any disruptions in the credit markets similar to that of the recent recession could further limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry and addressing our future capital requirements 
further  to the extent the counterparties to the convertible note hedges are unwilling or unable to fulfill the obligations under the convertible note hedges  our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include health maintenance organizations hmos  one health insuring corporation hic and one prepaid health services plan phsp 
hmos  hics and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
the parent company may be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe  as a result  that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has defined risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage that are designed to measure capitalization levels by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from a requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner  to b requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
eight of our eleven states have adopted rbc as the measure of required surplus 
at december   our consolidated rbc ratio for these states is estimated to be over which compares to the required level of  the level at which regulatory action would be initiated 
in the remaining states  we have approximately four times the state required surplus level 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments at december  in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations long term obligations 
long term obligations include amounts due under our convertible senior notes which mature may  operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under non cancelable office space leases 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
effective july   we renewed a collateralized irrevocable standby letter of credit  initially issued on july  in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million  to meet certain obligations under our medicaid contract in the state of georgia through our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc the letter of credit is collateralized through investments 
table of contents held by amgp georgia managed care company  inc additionally  certain provisions of our convertible senior notes  convertible note hedges and warrant instruments are off balance sheet arrangements  the details of which are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
commitments as of december   the company has no commitments 
inflation although health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to reduce the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our audited consolidated balance sheets include a number of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to our significant investment in fixed income investments  interest rate risk represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
the financial markets have experienced periods of volatility and disruption  which have impacted liquidity and valuations of many financial instruments 
while we do not believe we have experienced material adverse changes in the value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments  disruptions could impact the value of these assets and other financial assets we may hold in the future 
there can be no assurance that future changes in interest rates  creditworthiness of issuers  prepayment activity  liquidity available in the market and other general market conditions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity  financial position or cash flows 
as of december   substantially all of our investments were in high quality securities that have historically exhibited good liquidity 
the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk the risk of loss in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing market rates of interest for similar financial instruments 
however  we have the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
we rely on the experience and judgment of senior management to monitor and mitigate the effects of market risk 
the allocation among various types of securities is adjusted from time to time based on market conditions  credit conditions  tax policy  fluctuations in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we place the majority of our investments in high quality  liquid securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as of december   an increase of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would reduce the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would increase the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio by approximately million 
the above changes in fair value are impacted by securities in our portfolio that have a call provision feature 
we believe this fair value presentation is indicative of our market risk because it evaluates each investment based on its individual characteristics 
consequently  the fair value presentation does not assume that each investment reacts identically based on a change in interest rates
