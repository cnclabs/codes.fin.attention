item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a domestic provider of it and specialized healthcare staffing services to mostly large and medium sized organizations 
from july until our september  spin off  we conducted our business as subsidiaries of igate 
we do not sell  lease or otherwise market any computer software or hardware  and of our revenues are derived from the sale of information technology and specialized healthcare staffing services 
on january   we acquired curastat  inc  an arizona based provider of specialized healthcare staffing services 
this acquisition furthers our growth and service offering diversification strategies by providing an entry point into the specialized healthcare staffing space 
during  we expanded these operations geographically and added to our portfolio of service offerings 
this acquisition is more fully discussed in note  acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
on january   the company sold its brokerage operations service offerings operated under the name global financial services of nevada  as more fully discussed in note  divestiture of our brokerage operations service offerings to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
economic trends and outlook generally  our business outlook is highly correlated to general us economic conditions 
during periods of increasing employment and economic expansion  demand for our services tends to increase 
conversely  during periods of contracting employment and or a slowing domestic economy  demand for our services tends to decline 
as the economy slowed during the last half of and recessionary conditions emerged in and during much of  we saw less demand for it staffing services 
during the second half of  we began to see signs of market stabilization and a modest pick up in activity levels within certain sales channels and technologies 
during  market conditions continued to strengthen over the course of the year and activity levels within most of our sales channels progressively improved 
as we enter  we are encouraged by us economic expansion and some improvement in the job markets 
however  modest job growth to date and high unemployment levels are still troubling data points for our industry 
in addition to tracking general us economic conditions  a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients see item a  the risk factor entitled our revenues are highly concentrated  and the loss of a significant client would adversely affect our business and revenues 
accordingly  our trends and outlook are additionally impacted by the prospects and well being of these specific clients 
by way of illustration  during the second half of  while general us economic conditions were positive  we experienced a decline in billable headcount and negative sequential quarterly revenue growth due to client specific conditions at two of our larger clients 
this account concentration factor may result in our results of operations deviating from the prevailing us economic trends from time to time 
in recent years  a larger portion of our revenues have come from our wholesale it sales channel  which consists largely of strategic relationships with systems integrators and other staffing organizations 
this channel tends to carry lower gross margins  but provides higher volume opportunities 
should this trend in our business mix continue  it is likely that our overall gross margins will decline 
within our retail it sales channel  many larger users of it staffing services are employing managed service providers msp to manage their contractor spending in an effort to drive down overall costs 
should the trend towards utilizing the msp model continue  it is likely that our gross margins will be pressured in the future

in order to minimize the impact of the industry trends mentioned above on our operating margin  the company will need to continue lowering its operating cost structure as a percentage of total revenue through innovation and greater efficiencies 
investments in our global recruitment centers  offshore telesales group  and technological improvements  coupled with continued cost rationalization efforts  should provide us with a cost effective platform in which to deliver our services

this steep decline reflects a significantly lower level of billable consultants entering compared to the consultant base that we had at the start of it should be noted that for the full year  our billable consultant headcount in this channel grew modestly 
however  this growth was not enough to offset the impact of a significantly lower consultant base in which we entered healthcare staffing revenues totaled million in despite challenging market conditions in the healthcare space  we were able to grow revenues sequentially during the last two quarters of via geographical expansion and enhancements made to our service offerings

wholesale it channel gross margins increased by basis points in compared to this improvement was due to a favorable revenue mix between integrator clients and low margin staffing clients 
in our retail it channel  gross margins improved by basis points 
this improvement was due to higher margins at our branch operations  lower bench costs and higher skill set resources being placed at many of our msp clients  which carry better margin opportunities 
these factors helped to offset the decline in gross margins generally attributable to client adoption of the msp model

historically  we have funded our business needs with cash generated from operating activities 
in the staffing services industry  investment in operating working capital levels defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities is a significant use of cash 
controlling our operating working capital levels by closely managing our accounts receivable balance is an important element of cash preservation 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso s measurement was days at both december  and december  we believe that effectively managing our dso s has been an important factor in maximizing our cash flows in recent years 
cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalents balances on hand at december  are expected to be adequate to fund our business needs over the next months  exclusive of any acquisition activities and activities related to our recently announced share repurchase program 
below is a tabular presentation of cash flow activities for the periods discussed years ended december  cash flows activities amounts in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided from operating activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
factors contributing to cash flows during the period included net income of million  non cash charges of million principally related to stock based compensation  depreciation and deferred taxes and an increase in operating working capital of million 
the increase in operating working capital reflects higher activity levels and revenue growth experienced in compared to levels that existed at year end in  cash flows from operating activities included net income of million  non cash charges of million and a decrease in operating working capital of million 
the decline in operating working capital was largely due to lower activity levels experienced during in  cash flows from operating activities included net income of million  non cash charges of million  and a decline in operating working capital requirements of million

financing activities in  financing activities principally consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from stock option exercises 
in  financing activity generated million of cash flow related to excess tax benefits from share based payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
prior to our september  spin off from igate  our financial resources had historically been managed by our former parent on a centralized basis 
our cash balances were transferred to igate regularly  and igate funded our cash as needed 
in  prior to the spin off  we had net cash transfers to igate of million 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have financial commitments related to existing operating leases  primarily for office space that we occupy 
our commitments are as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total operating leases we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and  whenever possible  seek to insure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
seasonality our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations 
however  our consultants billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation patterns 
accordingly  we typically have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and require the application of significant judgment by management  and as a result  are 
table of contents subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observances of industry trends and other available information from outside sources  as appropriate 
the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein  for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on time and material contracts as services are performed and expenses are incurred 
time and material contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate  plus out of pocket expense reimbursement 
out of pocket expense reimbursement amounts vary by assignment  but on average represent approximately to of total revenues 
revenue is earned when the company s consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
in certain situations related to client direct hire assignments  where the company s fee is contingent upon the hired resource s continued employment with the client  revenue recognition is deferred until such employment conditions are satisfied 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts the company extends credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue  and the resulting accounts receivable  are from fortune companies  major systems integrators and other staffing organizations 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues based on services performed and  in accordance with the terms of the client contract  will be invoiced in a subsequent period 
accounts receivable are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts when it is probable that the related receivable balance will not be collected based on historical collection experience  client specific collection issues  and other matters the company identifies in its collection monitoring 
goodwill goodwill is the excess costs of acquired enterprises over the sum of the fair value amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less the fair value of liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangibles  goodwill and other 
the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment on december st of each year 
in the first step of goodwill impairment testing  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit  which is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  to the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets at the measurement date 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment calculation requires an allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired at the measurement date 
the excess fair value determined in step over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied value of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill is then compared to the implied value of goodwill and any excess of carrying value over implied value is recognized as goodwill impairment 
our annual impairment review process requires extensive use of accounting judgments and financial estimates  such as appropriate discount rates  growth rates and future cash flow assumptions

stock based compensation effective october   the company adopted a stock incentive plan the plan that provides up to  shares of the company s common stock shall be allocated for issuance to directors  executive management and key personnel 
grants under the plan can be made in the form of stock options  stock appreciation rights  performance shares or stock awards 
the plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
all awards under the plan as of december  have been in the form of stock options 
options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the company s common stock at the grant date and generally vest over a four year period 
we account for stock based compensation expense in accordance with asc topic share based payments which requires us to measure all share based payments based on their estimated fair value and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of our stock options is determined at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions associated with this option pricing model and other information related to our stock incentive plan are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes prior to our spin off  we filed our federal tax return as part of igate s consolidated us tax return 
as previously noted  we received certain tax benefits from being included in igate s consolidated tax return  which we will not enjoy as a stand alone company 
the impact on our income tax expense related to such benefits is discussed above and disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 
we determine our income tax provision using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle the temporary differences 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when  in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for the periods presented  no valuation allowance has been provided  except as described below 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
as of december   the company provided a liability of  for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  related to various federal and state income tax matters applicable to the periods subsequent to the distribution 
all periods subsequent to the distribution remain unaudited by federal and state income tax authorities 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating the consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the amendments in this asu establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
further  the term fair value in the revenue guidance will be replaced with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a market place participant 
the amendments in this asu will be effective 
table of contents prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
cash equivalents are stated at cost  which approximates market value 
our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variations 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of our global recruitment centers
