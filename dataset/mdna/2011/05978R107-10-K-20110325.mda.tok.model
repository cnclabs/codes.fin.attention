item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion and analysis reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about us that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
reference should be made to those financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report on form k for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
historical results of operations and any trends which may appear are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the financial statements contained in this report on form k 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report on form k 
executive summary the us economy and  more specifically  the financial services industry remained unsettled in the year ended december  the decline in real estate values which began in continued  and valuations across loans  foreclosed real estate and certain securities were adversely affected 
while banctrust did not have material exposure to many of the issues that plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles  collateralized debt obligations  the company s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily within its commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and other real estate expenses 
we reported net income available to common shareholders in of thousand  or per diluted common share  compared with net loss available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share  for the results included a million per diluted share non cash write off of goodwill 
the earnings were further reduced by effective preferred stock dividends of million  or per common share  in and million  or per common share  in net interest income increased to million in compared with million in the increase in interest income was due primarily to a basis point increase in the net interest margin to in compared with in banctrust s higher than normal level of non performing assets over the past several years has contributed to lower net interest income and net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses was million compared with million in the period 
the decrease in the provision since last year was due primarily to a substantial decrease in loan charge offs 
net charge offs were million in compared with million in non performing assets totaled million at december   compared with million at december  our provision for loan losses in  while still at elevated levels  was significantly lower than the provision recorded in in we significantly increased our provision for loan losses in response to increasing criticized and non performing assets  primarily in our coastal markets 
we believe the additional provisions were warranted in light of economic conditions and continued downward pressure on real estate collateral values 
the gulf oil spill in caused us to analyze our portfolio in order to assess possible credit losses resulting from the spill 
the spill was capped in late summer  and we currently do not expect any material negative impact on our customer base as a result of the spill 
although we believe our allowance is adequate at year end to cover projected loan losses  future change s in housing values  financial condition of borrowers  interest rates and economic conditions could impact the provision for credit losses for these loans in future periods 
we remain focused on credit quality to protect our future earnings and capital base 
non interest income was down million between and due primarily to decreased service charges and decreased gains on sale of investment securities 
lower overdraft fees resulting from increased use of debit cards that provide increased convenience to customers but do not allow them to overdraft their accounts contributed to the reduction in service charges 
non interest expense  excluding the million charge for goodwill impairment in  decreased to million in compared with to million in all major categories of non interest expense decreased in compared to  but the largest decreases were a million decrease in loss write down on other real estate owned  or oreo  and a million decrease in carrying costs related to oreo compared with the primary reason for the decline in loss write down on oreo was million in write downs of oreo located in the northwestern florida region during the second quarter of as a result of significant declines in property values in that area during that period 
oreo carrying costs were higher in than in  because the company brought past due property taxes current 
our market areas continue to be impacted by bank merger activity 
we remain focused on providing our customers with personal attention and services to support their financial requirements 
we believe we are in an excellent position to take advantage of the changes in the banking markets by leveraging our strong capital base to fund future loan growth as the economy recovers 
as a bank holding company  our results of operations are almost entirely dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary bank 
the following table contains selected data related to our subsidiary bank number of locations market area counties total assets at december  in thousands autauga  baldwin  barbour  bibb  butler  dallas  elmore  escambia  jefferson  lee  marengo  mobile  monroe  montgomery  shelby  in alabama and bay  okaloosa  walton in florida we offer a broad range of financial services to our customers  including retail banking  trust  insurance and securities services and products  through the bank  our trust department and a financial services subsidiary of the bank 
like most community banks  we derive the majority of our revenue from the interest we earn on our loans and investments  and our greatest recurring expense is the interest we pay on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our net interest income  which is the difference between the revenues we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expenses we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
another key measure of our success is our net interest margin  or the difference between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses  in the following discussion 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers  including service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage fees  trust fees and fees for investment services 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this non interest income  as well as of our non interest expense 
we measure and monitor the following factors as key indicators of our financial performance net income earnings per share loan and deposit growth credit quality effect of economic trends after approximately two of years of rising interest rates which began in  the federal reserve stopped increasing rates in  and problems in the sub prime real estate market began to appear later in the year 
in problems in the sub prime real estate market began to intensify  and problems in the debt markets in general began to develop 
in august of  the federal reserve began reducing interest rates in an effort to combat the economic effects of the debt problems 
the interest rate reductions accelerated throughout through and  rates remained stable at an historically low level 
along with the sub prime problems  the national real estate market continued to experience a general reduction in sales and values of homes and commercial real estate 
while these problems have affected wide areas of the united s tates  they have been amplified in our coastal markets in florida and alabama by the continuing market disruption caused by major hurricanes in and our urban markets such as mobile  montgomery and birmingham have not been as severely affected  however deterioration has occurred in all of our markets 
an increase in unemployment has exacerbated these problems 
the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate loan portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy that could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral values  title defects  inaccurate appraisals and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for construction  whether the builders can sell the home to buyers and whether buyers can obtain permanent financing 
until mid  real estate values in our metropolitan montgomery and coastal alabama and florid a markets increased  and employment trends in our market areas were favorable 
we experienced a slowdown in loan demand in our coastal markets in the fall of which continued through the most likely reason for the slowdown initially was the effects of hurricanes in and along the gulf coast  especially hurricane katrina in august of the sub prime problem  resulting in a deep recession  combined with the collapse of the real estate market in some areas  has intensified the problems along the gulf coast 
effects of the recent severe recession continued in financial and credit markets continued to be adversely affected  and consumer confidence across all sectors of the economy has declined since these conditions were accompanied by a further deterioration in the labor market and high unemployment  all of which contributed to continued market volatility as economic fears and illiquidity still exist 
increased credit losses from the weak economy negatively affected capital and earnings of most financial institutions 
financial institutions experienced significant declines in the value of collateral for real estate loans and heightened credit losses  resulting in record levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
in addition  certain financial institutions failed or merged with other institutions 
in signs began to emerge that the economy might be recovering slowly  but it is generally thought the recovery is very fragile 
the congress and various agencies of the united states government implemented a number of initiatives aimed at stabilizing the global economy and financial markets 
those initiatives include the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa including the troubled asset relief program tarp  the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  the financial stability plan and the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
arra  among other things  amended the terms of the tarp and imposed certain additional conditions and requirements on participating institutions such as banctrust 
however  it also loosened the limitations on redemption by allowing affected institutions to repay tarp proceeds at any time  subject to approval of the participating institution s primary regulator 
treasury  the fdic and other governmental agencies continue to enact rules and regulations to implement the eesa  tarp  the financial stability plan  the arra and related economic recovery programs  many of which contain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to take certain actions or to engage in certain activities if the financial institution is a participant in the tarp capital purchase program or related programs 
we are unable to predict the actual impact of the eesa  the fdic programs or any other governmental program on the financial markets 
on july   financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  will centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies 
require the office of the comptroller of the currency to seek to make its capital requirements for national banks  countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
require financial holding companies to be well capitalized and well managed as of july  bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the deposit insurance fund dif and increase the floor of the size of the dif 
impose comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself 
require large  publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management 
implement corporate governance revisions  including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders  that apply to all public companies  not just financial institutions 
make permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of securities investor protection corporation protection from thousand to thousand and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until december  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
amend the electronic fund transfer act efta to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers  having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
while there are signs that the economy is improving  unemployment remains high  and strained economic conditions are expected to continue in as a result  financial institutions like banctrust continue to experience historically high rates of credit losses and high levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
these factors negatively influenced  and likely will continue to negatively influence  earning asset yields at a time when the market for deposits is intensely competitive 
as a result  financial institutions experienced  and are expected to continue to experience  pressure on credit costs  loan yields  deposit and other borrowing costs  liquidity  and capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  included in this report on form k 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and th e effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a description of what we deem to be our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
loans and leases are charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan and lease losses is determined in accordance with gaap and other regulatory guidance 
the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan and lea se losses 
management has developed and uses a documented systematic methodology for determining and maintaining an allowance for loan and lease losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan and lease review is conducted to identify loans and leases with unusual risks and probable loss 
management uses the loan and lease review process to stratify the loan and lease portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans and leases in the portfolio  management determines estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans and leases  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral  and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired lo ans and leases 
specific allowances for impaired loans and leases are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans and leases to the present value of these loans and leases estimated cash flows discounted at each loan s or lease s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loan s or lease s observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans and leases is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans and leases  management also determines probable losses for all other loans and leases that are not individually evaluated 
the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to all other loans and leases in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan and lease type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan and lease quality ratios and such other factors that  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan and lease losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
th e assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
other real estate owned valuation other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value  as determined by management  less costs to dispose 
any excess of the recorded investment over fair value  less costs to dispose  is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure 
a provision is charged to earnings and the carrying value of other real estate owned is adjusted when  in the opinion of management  such losses have occurred 
the ability of the company to recover the carrying value of real estate is based upon future sales of the real estate 
the ability to effect such sales is subject to market conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the recognition of sales and sales gains or losses is dependent upon whether the nature and terms of the sales  including possib le future involvement of the company  if any  meet certain defined requirements 
if such requirements are not met  sale and gain recognition would be deferred 
income taxes management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases 
in estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risk of various tax positions considering statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations  interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments 
judgments are also exercised in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets and any needed valuation allowances 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of 
million 
accounting principles require that the company assess whether a valuation allowance should be established with respect to its deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard as to whether some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers both positive and negative evidence  including the scheduling of reversing differences  tax planning strategies  available tax carrybacks  recent and historical performance  expectations for future results of operations  and other factors in making this assessment 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires the company to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative  because it requires the future occurrence of circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company may not achieve sufficient future taxable inco me to allow the ultimate realization of its net deferred tax assets  and  therefore  the company may have to establish a valuation allowance at some point in the future 
if a valuation allowance is necessary  the company would incur a charge to operations in the period in which the allowance is established  which could have a material adverse effect on its earnings and capital position 
changes in the estimate of income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income  interpretations of tax laws  the complexities of multi state income tax reporting  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation  guidance  and income tax accounting pronouncements 
financial condition acquisition in october of  the company completed the acquisition of the peoples banctrust company  inc peoples 
on the acquisition date the assets of peoples were approximately million 
the acquisition of peoples was accounted for under the purchase accounting method as required by united states generally accepted accounting principles 
under this method of accounting  the financial statements and tables shown in this section do not reflect results of operations or the financial condition of peoples prior to october  one result of this accounting method is that certain items shown in the following financial statements and tables are less useful in comparing to other years shown 
average assets and liabilities average assets in were billion  relatively unchanged from and average loans in were billion compared to billion in average loans net of the loan loss reserve were billion in compared to billion in the decrease was a result of the weak economy s effect on loan demand  loan charge offs and the transfer of some loans to oreo through the foreclosure process 
during and  we concentrated our efforts on improving loan quality rather than on growing loans  and we expect this policy to continue at least through the first half of due to the soft economy 
compared to  average investment securities in increased million and average interest bearing deposits increased million  both of which increases were funded by the increase in average deposits and the decrease in average loans 
as liquidity concerns moderated somewhat in mid  we began increasing the size of the investment portfolio in order to increase our yield on earning assets 
average deposits in were billion compared to billion in short term and long term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  notes payable to our subsidiary statutory trusts issued in connection with trust preferred securities offerings and a note payable secured by the stock of our subsidiary bank 
in december  we issued an additional million of trust preferred securities 
some of the proceeds were used to pay off a bank loan  and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in october of  in order to complete the purchase of the peoples banctrust company  we obtained a term bank loan in the amount of million 
in december we issued million worth of preferred stock to the us treasury and used  million of the proceeds to pay down the bank loan 
our average equity as a percent of average total assets in was percent  compared to percent in average equity in and included approximately million and million  respectively  recorded as intangible assets related to acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
in  we wrote off all of our goodwill by recording a goodwill impairment charge through earnings 
this charge is the primary reason for the decreases in average equity as a percent of average total assets and average intangible assets

loan growth  which was strong until mid  slowed considerably in our coastal markets after the hurricane season and hurricane katrina in september of that year 
the storms of and caused severe problems in the property insurance industry as well as the tourism industry and triggered the slowdown in loan demand throughout our coastal markets that began in late the severe recession that followed the collapse of the sub prime market made the problem worse 
our average loan to deposit ratio was percent in  percent in and percent in our loan to depos it ratio at year end was percent compared to percent at year end and percent at year end our lending strategy concentrates on originating loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of our outstanding loans at december   million  or percent  mature within one year or otherwise reprice within one year 
net interest revenue and net interest margin increased in compared to  but both measures are still being affected by higher levels of non performing loans and oreo 
net interest revenue and the net interest margin are discussed more fully under results of operations 
we offer  through third party arrangements  certain mortgage loan products that we sell to these third parties shortly after origination and that are therefore not retained in our loan portfolio 
these products expand our mortgage loan product offerings and have the capacity to generate significant fee income  especially during periods of relatively low mortgage rates 
these fees have come from first and second home purchases as well as from home refinancing volume 
the return to lower mortgage rates has increased purchases and refinancing of existing homes

the c and i loan portfolio is diversified over a range of industries  including construction percent  manufacturing percent  healthcare percent  retail trade percent real estate percent  and agriculture percent 
approximately percent of the c and i portfolio is serviced in the southern alabama region  primarily in the mobile office 
approximately percent of the total loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate  primarily commercial construction  land  land development  and non residential and commercial mortgages 
project financing is an important component of the commercial real estate loan portfolio  which was impacted by charge offs and foreclosures during and management expects the economic and portfolio conditions discussed above to limit this type of lending in the immediate future  particularly in northwest florida

approximately percent of land and land development loans are serviced by the florida region 
the increase in commercial construction loans in southern alabama and northwest florida resulted primarily from efforts to rehabilitate problem assets and improve the value of problem assets 
provision for loan and lease losses and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to earnings that is added to the allowance for loan and lease losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in our loan and lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan and lease portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
risk management procedures are in place to assist in identifying potential problem loans and leases 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  economic factors and other risk factors 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan and lease charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan and lease losses charged to income  which increase the allowance 
management s evaluation of each loan or lease includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  and possible risks associated with concentrations of credit 
the loan and lease review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report prepared by loan review officers and delivered to management  which uses the report to determine whether any adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses are appropriate 
management submits these quarterly reports to banctrust s board of directors

our coastal markets continue to be particularly affected by adverse economic conditions 
total nonperforming loans in our gulf coast markets were million at december  as compared to million at december  the provision charged to operating expense was million in compared to million in loan charge offs  changes in risk grades and adjustments to allocations on individual loans affected the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category see table from to was relatively unchanged 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  including non performing loans and leases  and adjusts the allowance when appropriate 
management believes the current methodology used to determine the required level of reserves is adequate  and management considered the allowance adequate at december  deterioration of the credit quality of loans in our portfolio  especially loans along the immediate gulf coast  could lead to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods

loans are classified as non accrual by management upon the earlier of i a determination that collection of interest is doubtful  or ii the time at which such loans become days past due unless collateral or other circumstances reasonably assure full collection of principal and interest 
table sets forth certain information with respect to accruing loans days or more past due  loans on non accrual  restructured loans on non accrual  and other real estate owned 
non performing assets were million at year end compared to million at year end restructured loans on non accrual at december  were million compared to at december  management classifies loans as restructured when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers 
all of our restructured loans at december  were accruing interest 
at december   we had million in restructured loans which were accruing interest and which we consider performing 
 the company only restructures loans for borrowers in financial difficulty that have designed a viable business plan to fully pay off all obligations  including outstanding debt  interest  and fees  either by generating additional income or through liquidation of assets 
generally  these loans are restructured to provide the borrower additional time to execute upon their plans 
the performing restructured loans were not placed in nonaccrual status prior to the restructuring  and since the company expects the borrowers to perform after the restructuring based on modified note terms  the loans continue to accrue interest at the restructured rate 
the company will continue to closely monitor these loans and will cease accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms 
all restructured loans are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the quarterly allowance calculation 
as of december  and  the a llowance for loan and lease losses allocated to restructured loans totaled thousand and thousand  respectively 
non performing loans decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of the foreclosure of collateral securing real estate loans 
as previously discussed  the real estate markets along our gulf coast region have experienced a substantial slow down 
management continues to monitor these loans and other real estate loans along our coastal markets and meets regularly with local bank personnel to discuss and evaluate these loans  other potential problem loans  and the overall economic conditions within the market

these loans are primarily construction and land development loans 
potential problem loans are loans as to which management had serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans do not meet the criteria for  and are therefore not included in  non performing assets 
management  however  classifies potential problem loans as either special mention  watch  or substandard 
these loans were considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and are closely and regularly monitored to protect banctrust s interests

the first line of responsibility for the monitoring of credit quality and the assignment of risk grades based on policy guidelines to individual loans is the loan officer 
the loan review function  which reports to the board  assesses the accuracy of risk grading and performs periodic reviews of the overall credit and underwriting process 
the evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is quantified as the allowance for loan and lease losses that is reported in the company s financial statements 
the overall determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves significant judgment 
factors that affect this judgment are reviewed quarterly in response to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance is comprised of amounts needed for losses on criticized loans and amounts needed to cover historical losses on homogeneous groups of loans not subject to criticism 
historical loss factors are modified based on general economic conditions and other environmental risk factors 
loans subject to criticism through the company s risk grading process totaled million at december   a figure representing percent of total loans  and a decrease of million from december  the range of risk grades identifies loans on a spectrum from loans that warrant close monitoring due to potential weakness to loans with a high probability of loss 
management classifies certain loans as criticized loans 
criticized loans are further classified as doubtful  substandard  or special mention 
criticized loans are those loans which management considers to have greater risk that the borrower will not repay in full all contractual principal and interest 
all non performing loans are classified as criticized loans 
performing loans may be classified as criticized loans based on payment history  the financial condition of the borrower  or other factors management considers to raise doubt as to the borrower s willingness and ability to repay 
a deterioration of collateral values underlying the loans does not in itself lead to a loan being criticized 
an individual report on each criticized loan over million is completed quarterly by bank personnel 
this report provides an update on information about the loan as well as an update of the action plan for the ultimate collection of the loan 
this report includes information on the value of underlying collateral and allows us to closely monitor insufficient collateral positions and make necessary changes to loss reserve allocations 
real estate collateral is valued primarily based on outside appraisals although some real estate collateral is based on an internal evaluation 
real estate collateral values are updated periodically 
the geographic concentration of criticized loans in the northwest florida region was the direct result of the deterioration in real estate values in this area 
the majority of criticized loans in northwest florida are land and land development loans 
once the rapid deterioration in real estate values commenced  many developers in this area were no longer able to complete projects  and conversion of their properties could not be completed 
total charge offs in the northwest florida region were approximately million  which represented percent of total charge offs  during in order to monitor the movement in collateral values for real properties in the northwest florida region  management undertook a study in to determine to what extent real estate values had deteriorated in this market based on type of property 
from this analysis  management was able to discount prior appraisals in order to estimate current collateral values 
these values were then compared to current loan balances in order to establish a loss reserve allocation 
the majority of criticized loans in the central alabama region were commercial real estate  mostly construction  land  and land development loans 
the majority of criticized construction  land  and land development loans in the central alabama region were located in the montgomery county  autauga county  and lake martin areas  which also saw declines in real estate values 
management engaged an outside consultant to analyze average deteriorations in real property values in order to apply discounts to prior appraisals to determine current property values and to more closely monitor declines in real estate values in other geographic areas 
this analysis is being used by management in determining loss reserve allocations for these specific loans

the allowance for loan and lease losses represented percent of non performing loans and leases at december  and percent of non performing loans and leases at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases  net of unearned income  was percent at december  and percent at december  management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  including non performing loans and leases and classified loans and leases  and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
management considered the allowance for loan and lease losses adequate at december  to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
however  adverse economic c ircumstances or other events  including additional loan and lease review  future regulatory examination findings or changes in borrowers financial conditions  could result in increased losses in the loan and lease portfolio or in the need for increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the following section describes the composition of the various loan categories in our loan and lease portfolio and discusses management of risk in these categories 
commercial and industrial loans  or c and i loans  include loans to commercial customers for use in normal business to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases  or other expansion projects 
these credits may be loans and lines to financially strong borrowers  secured by inventories  equipment  or receivables  or secured in whole or in part by real estate unrelated to the principal purpose of the loan  and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower 
variable rate loans in this portfolio have interest rates that are periodically adjusted 
risk is minimized in this portfolio by requiring adequate cash flow to service the debt and the personal guaranties of principals of the borrowers 
the portfoli o of c and i loans decreased million  or percent  from december  to december   primarily as a result of paydowns 
agricultural loans include loans to fund seasonal production and longer term investments in land  buildings  equipment and breeding stock 
the repayment of agricultural loans is dependent on the successful production and marketing of a product 
risk is minimized in this portfolio by performing a review of the borrower s financial data and cash flow to service the debt  and by obtaining personal guaranties of principals of the borrower 
this type of lending represents million  or less than one percent  of the total loan portfolio 
the portfolio of agricultural loans increased million  or percent  from december  to december   as a result of new lending activity in central alabama 
equipment leases include leases that were acquired during the acquisition of the peoples bank and trust company 
banktrust is not actively engaged in equipment leasing 
these leases paid down million  or percent  from december  to december  management does not believe this portfolio represents a significant credit risk  since these loans are secured by the equipment being leased and are paying down at a significant rate 
commercial real estate loans include commercial construction  land loans  and land development loans  and other commercial real estate loans 
commercial construction  land  and land development loans include the development of residential housing projects  loans for the development of commercial and industrial use property  and loans for the purchase and improvement of raw land 
these loans are secured in whole or in part by the underlying real estate collateral and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower 
the bank s lenders work to cultivate long term relationships with established developers 
we disburse funds for construction projects as pre specified stages of construction are completed 
the portfolio of commercial construction loans decreased million  or percent  from december  to december   primarily as a result of chargeoffs  foreclosures  and paydowns 
commercial real estate loans include loans secured by commercial and industrial properties  apartment buildings  office or mixed use facilities  strip shopping centers  or other commercial property 
these loans are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower 
the portfolio of commercial real estate loans decreased thousand  or percent  from december  to december   a change not considered significant 
risk is minimized in this portfolio by requiring a review of the borrower s financial data and verification of the borrower s income prior to making a commitment to fund the loan 
personal guaranties are obtained for substantially all construction loans to builders 
personal financial statements of guarantors are obtained as part of the loan underwriting process 
for construction loans  regular site inspections are performed upon completion of each construction phase  prior to advancing additional funds for additional phases 
commercial construction and commercial real estate loans have been curtailed over the past two years due to the downturn in the real estate market 
residential construction loans include loans to individuals for the construction of their residences  either primary or secondary  where the borrower is the owner and independently engages the builder 
residential construction loans also include loans to builders for the construction of one to four family residences whereby the collateral  a proposed single family dwelling  is the primary source of repayment 
these loans are made to builders to finance the construction of homes that are either pre sold or those that are built on a speculative basis  although speculative lending in this category has been strictly limited and controlled over the past two to three years 
loan proceeds are to be disbursed incrementally as construction is completed 
the portfolio of residential construction loans increased thousand  or percent  from december  to december   primarily as a result of increased loans to builders in the central and southern alabama areas to construct speculative and pre sold single family entry level residential homes 
residential mortgage loans include conventional mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties 
these properties may serve as the borrower s primary residence  vacation home  or investment property 
we sell the majority of our residential mortgage loans originated with terms to maturity of years or greater in the secondary market 
we generally originate fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans using secondary market underwriting and documentation standards 
also included in this portfolio are home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower  s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
risk is minimized in this portfolio by reviewing the borrower s financial data and ability to meet both existing financial obligations and the proposed loan obligation  and by verification of the borrower s income 
the portfolio of residential mortgage loans decreased million  or percent  from december  to december   primarily as a result of paydowns  foreclosures  and charge offs 
consumer loans include a variety of secured and unsecured personal loans including automobile loans  marine loans  loans for household and personal purpose  and all other direct consumer installment loans 
risk is minimized in this portfolio by reviewing the borrower s financial data  ability to meet existing obligations and the proposed loan obligation  and verification of the borrower s income 
the portfolio of consumer loans decreased million  or percent  from december  to december   primarily as a result of paydowns 
repossessions and chargeoffs have been minimal in this portfolio since december  other loans comprise primarily loans to municipalities to fund operating expenses due to timing differences and capital projects 
the portfolio of other loans decreased million  or percent  from december  to december   as a result of paydowns 
the following table shows a more detailed risk profile of the loan portfolio by breaking down the loan categories described above into more specific categories of loans and showing the related percentage of non performing loans at december  and for each specific category 
commercial real estate continued to be our largest loan category at december   comprising percent of total loans 
commercial real estate also represented the majority of non performing loans at percent  with approximately percent of non performing loans consisting of land development and vacant land loans 
the downturn in the real estate market  primarily in the florida panhandle market  has had a significant impact on the commercial real estate portfolio as explained in the discussion above regarding criticized loans

securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities are classified as available for sale if they are to be held for indefinite periods of time  such as securities management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of our securities were stated at estimated fair value since they were in the available for sale category 
at december   we held no trading securities or securities classified as held to maturity 
the company recorded an impairment charge in earnings related to potential credit loss of thousand in related to one investment security 
no additional loss was recorded in the company has credit support from subordinate tranches of this security  but the company has concluded that its unrealized loss position is other than temporary 
the impairment amount related to credit loss was determined based on a discounted cash flow method that takes into account several factors including default rates  prepayment rates  delinquency rates  and foreclosure and loss severity of the underlying collateral 
changes in these factors in the future could result in an increase in the amount deemed to be credit related other than temporary impairment which would result in the company recognizing additional impairment charges to earnings fo r this security 
management continues to closely monitor this security 
the security has an estimated fair value of million and an unrealized loss of thousand at december  the company did not record any impairment charges in earnings related to this security in and the company does not believe that any non credit other than temporary impairments exist related to its other investment securities

banctrust has not promoted deposit growth through aggressive rate campaigns  but rather relies on superior customer service and products to retain existing customers and attract new ones 
additionally  we believe that increased fdic insurance limits have been a contributing factor leading to the growth in deposits 
the mix of deposits from to has remained relatively unchanged 
average deposits increased from billion in to billion in  as the company sought to maintain its deposit base during the turbulent year

core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  represented percent and percent at year end and  respectively 
however  a significant amount of our certificates of deposit which are defined in the industry as non core  are held by long time customers 
these deposits are classified by the regulatory agencies as non core because the amounts exceed  while our primary deposit taking emphasis focuses on attracting and retaining core deposits from customers who will also use our other products and services  we have from time to time found it necessary to use non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
this has not been the case in recent years  and we do not currently need to ac cess additional non core funding sources such as brokered deposits  as internally generated funds are supplying our liquidity needs 
during the first nine months of  we replaced brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings as they matured  as we sought to maintain our liquidity

off balance sheet arrangements the company  as part of its ongoing operations  issues financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the company generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
a financial standby letter of credit is a commitment by the company to guarantee a customer s repayment of an outstanding loan or financial obligation 
in a performance standby letter of credit  the company guarantees a customer s performance under a contractual non financial obligation for which it receives a fee 
the company has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
revenues are recognized over the life of the standby letter of credit 
the maximum potential amo unt of future payments the company could be required to make under its standby letters of credit at december  was million  and that sum represents the company s maximum credit risk

maximizing return means achieving or exceeding our profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
our asset liability management involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management that meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
management does not typically use derivative financial instruments as part of the asset liability management process 
our primary market risk is our exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing the effects of changes in market rates of interest on operating results and asset and liability fair values 
a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy is to manage and match the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
we use modeling techniques to simulate the effects various changes in market rates of interest would have on our interest income and on the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
important elements that affect the risk profile of our statement of condition in interest rate risk modeling include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of assets and liabilities 
using the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table  applying a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   we would expect a net increase in net interest income of million for the year following the rate increase 
using a scenario simulating a hypot hetical basis point decrease  we would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million for the year following the rate decrease 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events or of the actual effects such rate increases or decreases would have on our financial condition and operating results 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet its funding needs with its available sources of funds 
it represents our ability to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
in addition to our ability to meet liquidity demands through current assets and liabilities  we had available at december   federal funds lines of credit of million and availability on fhlb lines of credit of million 
our availability on our existing fhlb line of credit has been adversely impacted by new collateral standards issued by the fhlb and by our higher level on non performing assets 
our asset liability committee  which is made up of certain members of management and the board of directors  monitors our liquidity position and formulates and implements  when appropriate  corrective measures in the event certain liquidity parameters are exceeded 
banctrust s liquidity  on an unconsolidated basis  is dependent on the holding company s ability to pay its commitments as they come due 
banctrust s most significant recurring commitments consist of interest payments on debt obligations  dividends on the preferred stock held by the us treasury and operating costs 
banctrust typically relies on dividends from the bank to fund these payments 
the bank is currently unable to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
in addition  we are unable to declare dividends on our preferred stock held by the us treasury without prior approval from the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
the bank requested and received permission to pay dividends in the amount of million to banctrust in  and we have  to date  been able to obtain federal reserve approval for the d eclaration of dividends on our preferred stock held by the us treasury 
management may request approval for additional bank and holding company dividends as needed during the year 
as long as the bank remains classified under regulatory guidelines as well capitalized  we expect to be able to obtain approval for the bank to make dividend payments sufficient to enable banctrust to meet its commitments 
we also expect to be able to obtain federal reserve approval to declare dividends on our preferred stock 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the applicable regulatory agencies will grant our requests in full or in part 
additionally  a million principal payment on banctrust s million note payable secured by the stock of the bank is due on january   and we are required to make quarterly principal payments of million beginning in january in order to satisfy these principal payments  banctrust must either complete an equity offering prior to january in a su fficient amount to enable repayment  renew the note payable or obtain a new loan 
the fdic as receiver for silverton bank  na is the holder of the note payable  and any renewal of the note would require fdic approval 
in addition  we are currently required to obtain approval from the federal reserve bank of atlanta prior to incurring additional debt or modifying or refinancing the terms of existing debt 
we believe that completing an equity offering sufficient to repay the note is the best option at this time  however  we intend to seek fdic and federal reserve approval for a modification of the note  if needed  to defer the required principal payments to give us sufficient time to complete an equity offering 
management will continue to analyze its options for repayment  renewal or replacement of this note payable over the ensuing months and undertake what it deems to be the company s best available course of action within the required timeframe 
on november   we entered into a standby equity distribution agreement the standby agreement with ya global master spv ltd 
ya global  a fund managed by yorkville advisors  llc 
pursuant to the standby agreement  ya global has agreed to purchase up to million of newly issued common stock of the company in increments of not more than thousand weekly if notified to do so by the company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the standby agreement 
the standby agreement includes the following provisions regarding the sale of our common shares to ya global we may not sell  in the aggregate  more than of the total outstanding shares of the company s common stock at the date of the standby agreement 
ya global may not hold more than of the company s total shares outstanding at any time 
each advance must be preceded by at least trading days since the previous advance 
ya global will pay of the market price  as defined in the standby agreement  for our common stock purchased under the standby agreement 
we may not require ya global to purchase our common stock when banctrust is in possession of material nonpublic information 
unless terminated earlier  the standby agreement will terminate automatically on the earlier of november  or the date on which the aggregate purchases by ya global under the standby agreement total million 
during  we did not issue common stock under the standby agreement  however  through march   we have raised thousand through the sale of thousand shares of our common stock to ya global pursuant to the standby agreement 
our consolidated statements of cash flows provide an analysis of cash from operating  investing  and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million used in and million provided in net cash from investing activities used million in primarily due to the increase in interest bearing deposits and securities available for sale 
net cash from investing activities provided million in primarily due to the decrease in loans and the decrease in interest bearing deposits 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to the increase in deposits of million in net cash used in financing activities was million in and compared to million in  due primarily to the decrease in deposits of million in and million in the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was million in  compared to a net decrease of million in and a net decrease of million in interest rate sensitivity management attempts to maintain a proper balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market by monitoring our interest rate sensitivity 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  we can identify interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities typically change at differe nt times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liabilities can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of percent earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest rate sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
management evaluates several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  before making adjustments t o earning assets 
management tries to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed to maximize net interest revenue while minimizing interest rate risk 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
we have not in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity  however  in the peoples merger  we acquired an interest rate contract 
peoples purchased the interest rate contract to manage interest rate risk in its loan portfolio 
the contract was sold in the first quarter of for a gain of million 
at december   our three month gap position interest earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities was percent  and our twelve month cumulative gap position was percent 
our three month cumulative gap position was within the range established by management as acceptable  but our one year position was slightly out of the range 
our three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of earning assets that reprice upward during the three months would be accompanied by in interest bearing liabilities repricing upward during the same period 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue could be expected to decrease during the three month period of rising rates  as interest expense increases would exceed increases in interest income 
likewise  our twelve mon th gap position indicates that each of interest earning assets that reprices upward during such period would be accompanied by upward repricing of in interest bearing liabilities resulting in a decrease in net interest revenue 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories of liabilities are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most  including deposits  are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
because rates on liabilities are near historic lows  a further decrease in rates would probably not result in an increase in net interest revenue 
management has some flexibility when adjusting rates on these products 
therefore  the repricing of assets and liabilities would not necessarily take place at the same time and in corresponding amounts 
the following table summarizes our interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which their interest rates are scheduled to adjust 
fixed rate loans are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities 
collateralized mortgage obligations  which are amortizing investment securities  are included in the period for which principal payments are scheduled to be made 
mortgage backed securities  which are also amortizing investment securities  are included in the period matching their expected average life 
non amortizing investment securities are included in the period in which they are scheduled to mature 
fixed rate certificates of deposit are presented according to contractual maturity dates and variable rate cert ificates of deposit are included in the period in which their interest rates are eligible for adjustment

in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as interest rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy 
capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets was million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at year end  our tier capital ratio was  an increase from at year end both of the increases from to were caused by the increase in our capital which resulted in part from our net income in in the fourth quarter of  we applied to participate in the capital purchase program of the troubled asset relief program and were approved to issue preferred stock to the us treasury 
we completed the sale of million in preferred shares to the united states treasury on december  the preferred shares pay a cumulative annual dividend at the rate of for the first five years 
the dividend will increase to after five years if the preferred shares have not been redeemed by the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred shares  we issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share  which would represent an aggregate investment  if fully exercised of approximately million in banctrust common stock  or of the investment in preferred stock 
our participation resulted in the imposition of certain restrictions including limits on executive compensation and the requirement that we obtain prior approval from the us treasury before increasing our regular quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders above per share 
under the capital purchase program  the company s ability to purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration its common stock or trust preferred securities of its affiliates is restricted until the earlier of a the third anniversary of the issuance of the preferred stock and b the date on which the company has redeemed all of the preferred stock or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties  provided  however  that certain restrictions persist for any period when there are accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock outstanding 
we used million of the million in capital purchase program proceeds to repay a portion of the bank loan related to the peoples acquisition 
we contributed million in capital to the bank in early in december  we formed a wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary the trust 
the trust issued million of trust preferred securities guaranteed by banctrust on a junior subordinated basis 
we obtained the proceeds from the trust s sale of trust preferred securities by issuing junior subordinated debentures to the trust and used the proceeds to partially finance the purchase price of commercesouth  inc in december  we formed another wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary trust ii 
trust ii issued million of trust preferred securities guaranteed by banctrust on a junior subordinated basis 
we obtained the proceeds from trust ii s sale of trust preferred securities by issuing junior subordinated debentures to trust ii and used the proceeds to rep ay million of long term debt and for general corporate purposes 
under gaap  both the trust and trust ii must be deconsolidated with us for accounting purposes 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  the federal reserve board adopted changes to its capital rules with respect to the regulatory capital treatment afforded to trust preferred securities 
the federal reserve board s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included as tier capital up to of core capital 
we believe that our trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and expect that we will continue to treat our million of trust preferred securities as tier capital 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities are added to our tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier capital 
our leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by quarterly average assets  was at year end compared to at year end the federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies and banks to maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
our capital ratios expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  we exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december   and the minimum guidelines are shown in table additional information is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

results of operations net interest revenue net interest revenue  the difference between amounts earned on interest earning assets and the amounts paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the most significant component of earnings for a financial institution 
major factors influencing net interest revenue are changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities and changes in the asset liability mix 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on interest earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net interest margin is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total average interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of our effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
our net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points to percent compared to percent in and percent in from mid through mid  rising interest rates and a large increase in our loan volume resulted in an increase in our net yield 
this trend continued until the federal reserve stopped increasing rates in mid the federal reserve s monetary policy  combined with slower loan growth in  resulted in yield reduction 
in recent years  an increase in the amount of loans placed on non accrual  further reduced our net interest margin 
the rapid decrease in interest rates beginning in the third quarter of was a contributing factor as well 
the current high volume of non performing assets as of december   reduced our net interest margin by approximately to basis points in beginning in the second quarter of  as our deposit base began to stabilize after the financial industry crisis in the fall of  we began reducing the rates paid on our deposits 
also  as liquidity allowed  we increased the size of the investment portfolio in these factors contributed heavily to an improvement in our net interest margin in the third and fourth quarters of in  we continued to reduce the rates paid on deposits and increased the size of our investment portfolio while seeking to maintain sufficient liquidity 
additionally  we have been able to increase the yield of our loan portfolio as a result of our negotiating higher rate s or floors on renewing loans 
further cuts in interest rates  while not likely  could erode our margin by limiting our ability to offset point for point asset yield reductions with liability costs 
further liability cost reductions will be limited by competition for deposits as well as the inability to aggressively lower deposit rates below the already near historic low levels in some categories 
increases in interest rates could decrease our net interest margin if we are unable to reprice our interest earnings assets sooner  and to a greater extent  than our interest bearing liabilities

non interest revenue and non interest expense non interest revenue was million in  a decrease of million  or percent from the million in non interest income in service charges on deposit accounts decreased million  or percent 
the volume of non sufficient funds nsf activity  fees for which are included in service charge income  has decreased significantly 
management believes  and recent studies indicate  that the reduction in nsf fees has resulted from the rapid increase in the banking industry of electronic debits as a percent of total debits 
transactions resulting from debit cards  atm transactions  automated bill payment and ach payments rarely generate nsf fees  as transactions for which our customers do not have available funds are declined at the point of sale instead of posting to the account an d generating a nsf charge 
some of the decrease in nsf fees might be due to customers more diligently monitoring their personal accounts in this period of continued economic uncertainty 
trust revenue increased thousand  or percent  as a result of new business and the general improvement in the stock markets in compared to fees on many trust accounts are based on the value of the trust 
atm interchange fees  the largest component of other income  charges and fees  increased thousand  or percent 
recent legislation will allow the federal reserve to place on a limit on the amount of interchange fees per transaction which is likely to have an adverse effect of the amount of interchange fees we receive in the future

intangible amortization decreased thousand through amortization of our core deposit intangible on an accelerated basis 
loss on other real estate  which reflects both losses on the sale of and write downs of other real estate  in was million compared to million in the bp oil spill in april of had an adverse effect on our ability to sell real estate in our coastal markets  as potential purchasers of our real estate were deterred until such time as the oil spill was capped and potential lasting effects were determined 
for the years ended and  our proceeds from the sale of other real estate were million and million  respectively 
fdic assessments of million in compared to million in  reflect an increase in the fdic insurance rates and higher deposit balances 
the amount included a special assessment of basis points of our bank total assets less tier equity 
the amount of the special assessment in was approximately million 
legal fees increased thousand primarily related to costs associated with problem loan collection 
other real estate carrying cost  which includes property taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses  decreased from million i n to million in  despite the higher levels of other real estate owned  because the amounts included some property taxes that were paid in arrears  and because we were successful in our efforts to protest the amounts of some property tax assessments 
since the completion of our acquisition of peoples  we have experienced a decrease not only in personnel costs but also in other non interest expense categories  including advertising  data processing and stationery and office supplies due to increased efficiency resulting from the consolidation of certain functions 
while we have accomplished most of our cost reduction initiatives  our efforts will have an on going positive impact on non interest expense

increased levels of bank owned life insurance and municipal interest income combined with lower levels of pre tax income led to the tax benefit 
inflation and other issues because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on our assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by management s ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation
