risk factors 
operating overview highlights as we entered  we forecasted that advertising revenues in our markets would have no significant growth through at least the first quarter of the year  with only modest growth in certain categories throughout the remainder of our principal focus for potential revenue growth in was in two key areas cyclical political advertising and national advertising 
looking back on our results for  our actual experience and results were generally consistent with that forecast 
throughout  the disruption in our customers buying patterns and turbulence in the overall advertising industry caused by the recent economic recession  generally subsided 
by the second half of  we began to see a much more normalized operating cycle  and we began to experience improvements in certain key operating and liquidity metrics as further described below our station operating income grew by from the prior year  as a result of successfully growing revenues while containing operating costs across our station platform 
improved station operating income primarily enabled us to pay down approximately million of debt under our senior secured credit facilities  which reduced our overall net debt level total debt less available cash to at december  from million at december  the combination of these improved operating results and significant reduction in our debt load enabled us to reduce our total leverage ratio to approximately at december  from at december  amendment to the credit agreement on july   we entered into the july amendment 
in connection with the july amendment  bank of america  na resigned as administrative agent and the lenders appointed general electric capital corporation as successor administrative agent under the credit agreement for all purposes 
in addition  the july amendment grants us additional flexibility under the credit agreement to  among other things  i consummate an asset swap of our radio stations in canton  ohio for radio stations in the ann arbor  michigan and battle creek  michigan markets owned by capstar and currently operated by us pursuant to lmas  ii subject to certain conditions  acquire up to of the equity interests of cmp or two of its subsidiaries  cmpsc or radio holdings  iii subject to certain conditions and if necessary in order that certain of cmp s subsidiaries maintain compliance with applicable debt covenants  make further equity investments in cmp  in an aggregate amount not to exceed million  and iv enter into sale leaseback transactions with respect to communications towers that have an aggregate fair market value of no more than million  so long as the net proceeds of such transaction are used to repay indebtedness under our term loan facility 
acquisition of cmp on january  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining equity interests of cmp that we do not currently own 
in connection with the acquisition  we expect to issue  shares of our common stock to affiliates of the three private equity firms that collectively own of cmp bain  blackstone and thl 
blackstone will 
table of contents receive shares of our class a common stock and  in accordance with federal fcc broadcast ownership rules  bain and thl will receive shares of a new class of our non voting common stock 
we currently own the remaining of cmp s equity interests 
in connection with the acquisition  we also intend to acquire all of the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of a subsidiary of cmp  in exchange for an additional  shares of our common stock 
based on the closing price of our common stock on january  the last trading day prior to announcement of the transaction  the implied enterprise value of cmp is approximately million  which includes an estimated million of cmp net debt and preferred stock as of december  this represents a valuation of approximately times cmp s estimated station operating income 
this transaction will not trigger any change of control provisions in our credit agreement or in cmp s credit agreement or bond indentures 
the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  and is subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals and other customary conditions 
the holders of our shares  representing approximately of our voting power  have agreed to vote to approve the share issuances and an amendment to our certificate of incorporation  both of which are required to complete the transaction 
in addition  on february   we received an initial order from the fcc approving the transaction 
we are currently waiting for the approval to become final 
acquisition of citadel on march   we entered into the merger agreement with citadel  holdco and merger sub 
pursuant to the merger agreement  at the closing  merger sub will merge with and into citadel  with citadel surviving the merger as an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
at the effective time of the merger  each outstanding share of common stock and warrant of citadel will be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive  at the election of the stockholder subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement  i in cash  ii shares of our common stock  or iii a combination thereof 
additionally  prior to the merger  each outstanding unvested option to acquire shares of citadel common stock issued under citadel s equity incentive plan will automatically vest  and all outstanding options will be deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise  with the resulting net citadel shares eligible to receive the merger consideration 
holders of unvested restricted shares of citadel common stock will be eligible to receive the merger consideration for their shares pursuant to the original vesting schedule of such shares 
elections by citadel stockholders are subject to adjustment so that the maximum amount of shares of our common stock that may be issuable in the merger is  and the maximum amount of cash payable by us in the merger is  in connection with entering into the merger agreement  we have obtained commitments for up to million in equity financing and commitments for up to billion in senior secured credit facilities and million in senior note bridge financing  the proceeds of which will be used to pay the cash portion of the consideration in the merger  and to effect a refinancing of the combined entity the company  cmp and citadel 
final terms of the debt financing will be set forth in definitive agreements relating to such indebtedness 
the consummation of the merger is subject to various customary closing conditions  including i approval by citadel s stockholders  ii hsr approval  iii regulatory approval by the federal communications commission  and iv the absence of a material adverse effect on citadel or us 
completion of the merger is anticipated to occur by the end of our business we engage in the acquisition  operation  and development of commercial radio stations in the united states 
in addition  we  along with three private equity firms  formed cmp  which acquired the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna in may as a result of our investment in cmp and the acquisition of susquehanna s radio operations  we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations and believe we are the fourth largest radio broadcasting company based on net revenues 
as of december   directly and through our investment in cmp  we owned and or operated stations in united states markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
the 
table of contents following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by various ratings agencies on a periodic basis 
we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty and we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings are limited in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment 
although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
the optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the programming format of a particular station 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory available for advertising 
this target level of inventory for sale may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand 
we seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our cluster of stations  thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our net broadcasting revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year as advertising generally declines following the winter holidays  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  which follows in this section 

table of contents results of operations analysis of consolidated statements of operations the following analysis of selected data from our consolidated statements of operations should be referred to while reading the results of operations discussion that follows dollars in thousands year ended december  vs vs change change change change net revenues station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees depreciation and amortization lma fees corporate general and administrative including non cash stock compensation expense gain on exchange of assets or stations realized loss on derivative instrument impairment of intangible asssets and goodwill other operating expense operating income loss interest expense  net terminated transaction expense income other income expense  net income tax expense benefit equity losses in affiliate net income loss calculation is not meaningful 
our management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the three years ended december   have been presented on a historical basis 
year ended december  versus year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an million increase in national and political revenue which was offset by a decrease of million spread over the remainder of the revenue categories 
we believe that advertising revenue in our markets will have modest growth through the first half of as the local advertising marketplace becomes more robust in conjunction with improved macroeconomic conditions 
we also believe we will see continued growth in national advertising spending  although at lower levels than we experienced in while we anticipate continued strength in our core advertising categories into the second half of  we will face a tougher comparison period due to the absence of cyclical political spending 
overall  we are experiencing a much more normalized marketplace than seen in recent years 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
station operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million decrease in programming expense and a million decrease in sales expense 
we will continue to monitor all our operating costs and to the extent we are able to identify any additional cost saving measures  we will implement them as needed to remain in compliance with current and future debt covenant requirements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully depreciated coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures 
lma fees 
lma fees for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million for the year ended december lma fees in the current year were comprised primarily of fees associated with stations operated under lmas in cedar rapids  iowa  ann arbor  michigan  green bay  wisconsin  and battle creek  michigan 
corporate general and administrative including non cash stock compensation expense 
corporate operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in non recurring severance costs of million  a decrease of million in consulting and professional fees  with the remaining million decrease attributable to miscellaneous expenses 
gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during the second quarter of we completed an exchange transaction with clear channel to swap five of our radio stations in green bay  wisconsin for two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million during the second quarter 
we did not complete any similar transactions in realized loss on derivative instrument 
during the years ended december  and we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  related to our recording of the fair market value of the green bay option 
we entered into the green bay option in conjunction with an asset exchange in the second quarter of impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we recorded approximately million and million of charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impairment loss is related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded in conjunction with our annual impairment testing conducted during the fourth quarter see note  intangible assets and goodwill in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this report 
interest expense  net 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  while overall interest expense decreased  the interest expense associated with outstanding debt increased by million to million as compared to million in the prior year s period 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in the borrowing base due to the pay down of approximately million of debt compared to the same period in the prior year 
additionally  interest expense increased by million related to the yield adjustment on the interest rate swap 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap option agreement

we had no similar expense for the year ended december  
table of contents income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax expense of million as compared with a million benefit during the prior year 
the income tax expense for is primarily due to tax amortization of intangible assets  while the benefit is primarily due to the impairment charge on intangible assets 
equity loss in affiliate 
during the years ended december  and  our share of cmp s accumulated deficit exceeded our investment in cmp  and as a result  we did not record a gain or loss 
station operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  station operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap financial measure

intangible assets  net of amortization  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill 
intangible assets  net  decreased from the prior year primarily due to a million impairment charge taken for the year ended december   in connection with our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of which was offset by the purchase of million of intangible assets in we continue to monitor whether any impairment triggers are present and we may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods 
our impairment testing requires us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth of our businesses 
additionally the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairments tests are performed 
the recent general economic pressures that impacted both the national and a number of our local economies may result in non cash impairments in future periods 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations

net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million decrease in political revenue and the impact the recent economic recession has had across our entire station platform 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
station operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our continued efforts to contain operating costs  such as employee reductions  a mandatory one week furlough  and continued scrutiny of operating expenses 
we will continue to monitor all our operating costs and  to the extent we are able to identify any additional cost saving measures we will implement them  in an attempt to remain compliant with current and future covenant requirements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully depreciated coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures 
lma fees 
lma fees totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lma fees in the current year were comprised primarily of fees associated with stations operated under lmas in cedar rapids  iowa  ann arbor  michigan  green bay  wisconsin  and battle creek  michigan 
corporate general and administrative including non cash stock compensation expense 
corporate operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to non recurring severance costs and other professional fees associated with corporate restructuring of approximately million  an increase of million in professional fees associated with our defense of certain lawsuits  transaction costs associated with an asset exchange and the amendment to the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities the june amendment  and a million increase in franchise taxes resulting from one time prior period credits  partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock compensation  with the remaining million increase attributable to miscellaneous expenses 
realized loss on derivative instrument 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million related to our recording of the fair market value of the green bay option 
we entered into the green bay option in conjunction with an asset exchange in the second quarter of  therefore  there is no amount related to the green bay option recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the green bay option declined in value primarily due to the continued decline in the market operating results 

table of contents gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during the second quarter of we completed an exchange transaction with clear channel to swap five of our radio stations in green bay  wisconsin for two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million during the second quarter 
we did not complete any similar transactions in the prior year 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we recorded approximately million and million of charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impairment loss related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded during the third and fourth quarters of was primarily due to changes in certain key assumptions and estimates used to determine fair value 
the primary drivers of the change were decreases in advertising revenue growth projections for the radio broadcasting industry 
declines of specific markets revenue and increases in the discount rates were the primary reasons for further decline in the fourth quarter see note  intangible assets and goodwill in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this report 
costs associated with terminated transaction 
we did not incur any costs associated with a terminated transaction for the year ended december  as compared to million in these costs were attributable to a going private transaction that was terminated in may interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended year ended december  interest expense associated with outstanding debt decreased by million to million as compared to million in the prior year s period  primarily due to lower average levels of bank debt  as well as a decrease in the interest rates associated with our indebtedness 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in the yield adjustment associated with our interest rate swap due to a decrease in the libor rate 
we fixed million of our term loan assuming interest rates would continue to increase  however  in light of the recent economic downturn our borrowing rates have significantly decreased and remain extremely low 
thus  this fluctuation in the derivative increased our interest expense

we recorded a tax benefit of million as compared with a million benefit during the prior year 
the income tax benefit in both periods is primarily due to the impairment charge on intangible assets 
equity loss in affiliate 
in and our share of cmp s accumulated deficit exceeded our investment in cmp and as a result we did not record a gain or loss in in  the equity losses in affiliate were limited to our investment in cmp  which totaled million

intangible assets  net of amortization  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill 
intangible assets  net  decreased from the prior year primarily due to a million impairment charge taken for the year ended december   in connection with our impairment evaluations of intangible assets in the third and fourth quarters of seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and repayments of bank borrowings interest payments capital expenditures acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets repurchases of common stock funding needs on a long term basis will include capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations  implementing hd radio tm technology and potential future acquisitions 
in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology on up to of our stations 
under the terms of our original agreement with ibiquity  we agreed to convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our agreement with ibiquity to reduce the number of planned conversions  extend the build out schedule  and 
table of contents increase the license fees to be paid for each converted station 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between million and million 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or  audience tastes  and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us 
management has taken steps to mitigate this risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancements to our credit approval process 
as discussed further below  borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
in addition  pursuant to the june amendment to the credit agreement  we were required to repay excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis from september  through december   while maintaining a minimum balance of million of cash on hand 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined  based on our financial condition as of december   that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and  if necessary  further financing activities  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and debt service payments and potential acquisitions and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations through december  however  given the uncertainty of our markets cash flows  and the impact of the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that cash generated from operations will be sufficient or financing will be available at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
our operating plan takes into account the industry turbulence experienced over the past few years  and its recent stabilization 
we anticipate that our plan will enable us to remain in compliance with all bank covenants  including the total leverage ratio covenant in effect on march   through march  the severe recession experienced in  plus a material decline in automotive advertising  created a historically unique period for the radio industry over the past three years 
however  we saw a general stabilization in the broader economy during and a continuation of the modest increases in advertising spending seen late in the fourth quarter of altogether  these events fueled modest revenue growth for our company and the industry at large in as we look ahead  we believe will be fairly consistent with the prior year  again anticipating a period of modest growth for the radio industry overall 
however  unlike  where growth was driven primarily by automotive and political advertising  we anticipate that growth will be driven by more broad based increases across all key advertising categories as local advertising overall continues to show strength 
in addition  the maturity expiration of our interest rate swap should provide us with an additional million to million in free cash flow during the last three quarters of over the same prior year period 
finally  in accordance with the terms of our amended term loan facility  interest rate spread on our borrowings is expected to decrease by an additional basis points when the first quarter excess cash flow payment is made 
all of the aforementioned factors should help contribute to a more efficient capital structure by enhancing our overall working capital and liquidity 
if our revenues were to be significantly less than planned due to difficult market conditions or for other reasons  our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement would become increasingly difficult without remedial measures  such as the implementation of further cost abatement initiatives 
if our remedial measures were not successful in maintaining covenant compliance  then we would need to seek an amendment or waiver to our credit agreement  which could result in higher interest expense or other fees or costs to us 
there can be no assurance that we can obtain such amendment or waiver to our credit agreement 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities increased million and decreased million  respectively 
excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels 
table of contents of operating income for and as compared with the prior years 
as a result  the change in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures and a million decrease in proceeds from the sales of radio assets year over year 
cash flows used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in repayments of debt in as compared to and a million decrease related to fees paid directly to our lenders 
for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased million  primarily due to repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
acquisitions we did not complete any material acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended december  acquisitions green bay and cincinnati asset exchange on april   we completed an asset exchange agreement with clear channel 
as part of the asset exchange  we acquired two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio in consideration for five of our radio stations in the green bay  wisconsin market 
the exchange transaction provided us with direct entry into the cincinnati market notwithstanding our current presence in cincinnati through our investment in cmp  which was ranked at that time by arbitron 
larger markets are generally desirable for national advertisers  and have large and diversified local business communities providing for a large base of potential advertising clients 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
the fair value of the assets acquired in the exchange was million refer to the table below for the purchase price allocation 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs related to this transaction and expensed them as incurred through earnings within corporate general and administrative expense 
the results of operations for the cincinnati stations acquired are included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date 
the results of the cincinnati stations were not material 
prior to the asset exchange  we did not have a preexisting relationship with clear channel within the green bay market 
in conjunction with the exchange  we entered into an lma with clear channel whereby we agreed to provide programming  sell advertising  and retain operating profits for managing the five green bay radio stations 
in consideration for these rights  we pay clear channel a monthly fee of approximately million over the term of the agreement 
the term of the lma is for five years  expiring december  in conjunction with the lma  we included the net revenues and station operating expenses associated with operating the green bay stations in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the lma april  through december  additionally  clear channel negotiated the green bay option  which allows them to require us to repurchase the five green bay radio stations at any time during the two month period commencing july  or earlier if the lma agreement is terminated prior to this date for million the fair value of the radio stations as of april  
we accounted for the green bay option as a derivative contract and accordingly  the fair value of the green bay option was recorded as a liability at the acquisition date and offset against the gain associated with the asset exchange 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the derivative are recorded through earnings 

table of contents in conjunction with the transactions  we recorded a net gain of million  which is included in gain on exchange of assets in the statement of operations 
this amount represents a gain of approximately million recorded on the green bay stations sold  net of a loss of approximately million representing the fair value of the green bay option at acquisition date 
the table below summarizes the purchase price allocation allocation amount fixed assets broadcast licenses goodwill other intangibles total purchase price less carrying value of green bay stations gain on asset exchange less fair value of green bay option april  net gain wzbn fm swap during the first quarter ended march   we completed a swap transaction pursuant to which we exchanged wzbn fm  camilla  georgia  for wbc  a translator licensed for use in atlanta  georgia  owned by extreme media group 
the transaction was accounted as a business combination and was not material to our results 
completed dispositions we did not complete any divestitures during the years ended december  and december   other than as described above 
pending acquisitions at december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which we would exchange our canton  ohio station  wrqk fm  for eight stations owned by clear channel in ann arbor  michigan wtka am  wlby am  wwww fm  wqkl fm and battle creek  michigan wbfn am  wbck fm  wbck am and wbxx fm 
we will dispose of two of the am stations in battle creek  wbck am and wbfn am  simultaneously with the closing of the swap transaction to comply with the fcc s broadcast ownership limits  wbck am will be transferred to family life broadcasting system placed in a trust for the sale of the station to an unrelated third party and wbfn am will be transferred to family life broadcasting system 
credit agreement and the june amendment we experienced revenue declines in late and throughout in line with macro industry trends and consistent with our radio peer group  particularly when compared to groups with similar market sizes and portfolio composition 
in anticipation of significant revenue declines and in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these declines on profitability  in early we engaged in an aggressive cost cutting campaign across all of our stations and at corporate headquarters 
however  even with these cost containment initiatives in place  our rapidly deteriorating revenue outlook left uncertainty as to whether we would be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in the then existing credit agreement 
as an additional measure  we obtained the june amendment to the credit agreement that  among other things  temporarily suspended certain financial covenants  as further described below 
the credit agreement maintains the preexisting term loan facility of million  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million immediately after closing the june amendment  and reduced the 
table of contents preexisting revolving credit facility from million to million 
incremental facilities are no longer permitted as of june  under the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted including fcc licenses held by its subsidiaries  including  without limitation  intellectual property and all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including broadcast software international  inc  which prior to the june amendment  was an excluded subsidiary 
our obligations under the credit agreement continue to be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains terms and conditions customary for financing arrangements of this nature 
the term loan facility will mature on june  the revolving credit facility will mature on june  borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility bore interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate currently defined as the higher of the wall street journal s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus 
in july  our aggregate principal payments which were made in accordance with our obligation to make mandatory prepayments of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  as described below  exceeded million  and triggered a reduction in our interest rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate plus 
once we reduce the term loan facility by an aggregate of million through further mandatory prepayments of excess cash flow  the revolving credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate plus 
in connection with the closing of the june amendment  we made a voluntary prepayment in the amount of million 
we were also required to make quarterly mandatory prepayments of of excess cash flow through december   before reverting to annual prepayments of a percentage of excess cash flow  depending on our leverage  beginning in certain other mandatory prepayments of the term loan facility will be required upon the occurrence of specified events  including upon the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness and upon the sale of certain assets 
covenants the representations  covenants and events of default in the credit agreement are customary for financing transactions of this nature and are substantially the same as those in existence prior to the june amendment  except as follows the total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants were suspended during the covenant suspension period  during the covenant suspension period  we were required to maintain minimum trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of million for fiscal quarters through march   increasing incrementally to million for fiscal quarter ended december   subject to certain adjustments  and maintain minimum cash on hand defined as unencumbered consolidated cash and cash equivalents of at least million  we are restricted from incurring additional intercompany debt or making any intercompany investments other than to the parties to the credit agreement  we could not incur additional indebtedness or liens  or make permitted acquisitions or restricted payments except under certain circumstances  pursuant to the july amendment to the credit agreement  described under the caption july amendment  during the covenant suspension period after the covenant suspension period  the credit agreement will permit indebtedness  liens  permitted acquisitions and restricted payments  subject to certain leverage ratio and liquidity measurements  and we must provide monthly unaudited financial statements to the lenders within days after each calendar month end 
events of default in the credit agreement include  among others  a the failure to pay when due the obligations owing under the credit facilities  b the failure to perform and not timely remedy  if applicable certain covenants  c cross default and cross acceleration  d the occurrence of bankruptcy or insolvency events  
table of contents e certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries  f the loss  revocation or suspension of  or any material impairment in the ability to use of or more of  any of our material fcc licenses  g any representation or warranty made  or report  certificate or financial statement delivered  to the lenders subsequently proven to have been incorrect in any material respect  and h the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may terminate the loan commitments  accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the credit agreement and the ancillary loan documents as a secured party 
as discussed above  our covenants for the year ended december  were as follows a minimum trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda of million  a million minimum cash on hand  and a limit on annual capital expenditures of million annually 
the trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda and cash on hand at december  were million and million  respectively 
if we had been unable to obtain the june amendment to the credit agreement  such that the original total leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants were still operative  those covenants for the year ended december  would have been as follows a maximum total leverage ratio of  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at december   the total leverage ratio was and the fixed charge coverage ratio was for the quarter ending march  the first quarter after the covenant suspension period  the total leverage ratio covenant will be and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be if we were unable to repay our debts when due  including upon an event of default  the lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the credit agreement 
if the lenders accelerate the maturity of outstanding debt  we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of the senior secured credit facilities  and we cannot be assured that sufficient assets will remain after we have paid all of the debt 
the ability to liquidate assets is affected by the regulatory restrictions associated with radio stations  including fcc licensing  which may make the market for these assets less liquid and increase the chances that these assets will be liquidated at a significant loss 
as of december   prior to the effect of the forward starting libor based interest rate swap arrangement entered into in may may swap  the effective interest rate of the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities was approximately 
as of december   the effective interest rate inclusive of the may swap was approximately 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risks accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on several factors including the length of time receivables are past due  trends and current economic factors 
all balances are reviewed and evaluated on a consolidated basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
in the opinion of our management  credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of our diversified customers and the geographic diversification of our customer base 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and believe that adequate allowances for any uncollectible accounts receivable are maintained 
intangible assets we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
we are required to review the carrying value of certain intangible assets and our goodwill annually for impairment  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  and record any impairment to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we had million in intangible assets and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach and discounted cash flow methodology 
as part of our overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill  we have determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the reporting units are based on currently available data and management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values 
we generally conducted our impairment tests as follows step goodwill test in performing our interim impairment testing of goodwill  the fair value of each market was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  an income approach 
the discounted cash flow approach requires the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate 
we used an approximate eight year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant level 
we made certain assumptions regarding future audience shares and revenue shares in reference 
table of contents to actual historical performance 
we then projected future operating expenses in order to derive operating profits  which we combined with working capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows 
for our annual impairment test  we performed the step test and compared the fair value of each market to the carrying value of its net assets as of december  using the step test 
this test was used to determine if any of our markets have an indicator of impairment ie the market net asset carrying value was greater than the calculated fair value of the market 
instances where this was the case  we then performed the step test in order to determine if goodwill in those markets was impaired 
our analysis determined that  based on our step goodwill test  the fair value of of our markets containing goodwill balances was below its carrying value 
for the remaining markets  since no impairment indicator existed in step  we determined goodwill was appropriately stated as of december  step goodwill test as required by the step test  we prepared an allocation of the fair value of the markets identified in the step test as if each market was acquired in a business combination 
the presumed purchase price utilized in the calculation is the fair value of the market determined in the step test 
the results of the step test and the calculated impairment charge follows dollars in thousands reporting unit implied goodwill december  market id fair value value carrying value impairment market the following table provides a breakdown of the goodwill balances as of december   by market market id goodwill balance market market market market market market market market market market market market market market market to validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of the impairment charge related to goodwill  we conducted an overall reasonableness check of our fair value calculations by comparing the aggregate  calculated fair value of our markets to our market capitalization as of december   prepared a market fair value calculation using a multiple of adjusted ebitda as a comparative data point to validate the fair values calculated using the discounted cash flow approach  reviewed the historical operating performance of each market with impairment  
table of contents the discount rate employed in the market fair value calculation ranged between and for our annual test 
we believe that the discount rate range was appropriate and reasonable for goodwill purposes due to the resulting implied exit multiple of approximately for periods after  we projected a median annual revenue growth of and median annual operating expense to increase at a growth rate of for our annual test 
we derived projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical financial performance and expected future revenue growth 
our projections were based on then current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the markets 
after completing our annual test  as compared with the market capitalization value of million as of december   the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately million was approximately million  or  higher than market capitalization 
key data points included in the market capitalization calculations were as follows shares outstanding of million as of december   average closing price of our class a common stock over days for december  of per share  and debt discounted by gross million and million  net  on december  utilizing the above analysis and data points  we concluded the fair values of our markets  as calculated  are appropriate and reasonable 
indefinite lived intangibles fcc licenses we perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles our fcc licenses during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
we have combined all of our broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes 
as part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite lived intangibles test  we determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing 
as a result of the annual impairment test  we determined that the carrying value of certain reporting units fcc licenses exceeded their fair values 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million as a result of the annual impairment test to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
we note that the following considerations continue to apply to the fcc licenses in each market  the broadcast licenses were purchased to be used as one combined asset  the combined group of licenses in a market represents the highest and best use of the assets  and each market s strategy provides evidence that the licenses are complementary 
for the annual impairment test we utilized the three most widely accepted approaches in conducting our appraisals the cost approach  the market approach  and the income approach 
in conducting the appraisals  we conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued 
the cost approach measures value by determining the current cost of an asset and deducting for all elements of depreciation ie  physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence 
in its simplest form  the cost approach is calculated by subtracting all depreciation from current replacement cost 
the market approach measures value based on recent sales and offering prices of similar properties and analyzes the data to arrive at an indication of the most probable sales price of the subject property 
the income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject property  which is then analyzed and projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value 
we relied on both the income and market approaches for the valuation of the fcc licenses  with the exception of certain am and fm stations that have been valued using the cost approach 
we estimated this replacement value based on estimated legal  consulting  engineering  and internal charges to be  for each fm station 
for each 
table of contents am station the replacement cost was estimated at  for a station licensed to operate with a one tower array and an additional charge of  for each additional tower in the station s tower array 
the estimated fair values of the fcc licenses represent the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties ie other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
a basic assumption in our valuation of these fcc licenses was that these radio stations were new radio stations  signing on the air as of the date of the valuation 
we assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date  except that these stations were just beginning operations 
in doing so  we bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly valued the fcc licenses 
we estimated the values of the am and fm licenses  combined  through a discounted cash flow analysis  which is an income valuation approach 
in addition to the income approach  we also reviewed recent similar radio station sales in similarly sized markets 
in estimating the value of the am and fm licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis  in order to make the net free cash flow to invested capital projections  we began with market revenue projections 
we made assumptions about the stations future audience shares and revenue shares in order to project the stations future revenues 
we then projected future operating expenses and operating profits derived 
by combining these operating profits with depreciation  taxes  additions to working capital  and capital expenditures  we projected net free cash flows 
we discounted the net free cash flows using an appropriate after tax average weighted cost of capital ranging between approximately and for the annual test  and then calculated the total discounted net free cash flows 
for net free cash flows beyond the projection period  we estimated a perpetuity value  and then discounted to present values  as of the valuation date 
we performed discounted cash flow analyses for each market 
for each market valued we analyzed the competing stations  including revenue and listening shares for the past several years 
in addition  for each market we analyzed the discounted cash flow valuations of its assets within the market 
finally  we prepared a detailed analysis of sales of comparable stations 
the first discounted cash flow analysis examined historical and projected gross radio revenues for each market 
in order to estimate what listening audience share and revenue share would be expected for each station by market  we analyzed the arbitron audience estimates over the past two years to determine the average local commercial share garnered by similar am and fm stations competing in those radio markets 
often we made adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on its stations signal coverage of the market and the surrounding area s population as compared to the other stations in the market 
based on management s knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets  we determined that approximately three years would be required for the stations to reach maturity 
we also incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model the stations gross revenues through  the projected operating expenses and profits over the same period of time we considered operating expenses  except for sales expenses  to be fixed  and assumed sales expenses to be a fixed percentage of revenues  the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital  depreciation on start up construction costs and capital expenditures we calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines over five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on the air  and amortization of the intangible asset the fcc license we calculated amortization on a straight line basis over years 

table of contents in addition  we performed the following sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a change in certain variables contained within the impairment model increase in license impairment assumption change at december  in millions decline in revenue growth rates decline in station operating income increase in discount rate we prepared the following sensitivity analysis on markets for which the analysis indicated no impairment by applying a hypothetical   or decrease in the fair value of the broadcast licenses 
change in license fair value additional impairment after federal and state taxes are subtracted  net free cash flows were reduced for working capital 
according to recent editions of risk management association s annual statement studies  over the past five years  the typical radio station has an average ratio of sales to working capital of 
in other words  approximately of a typical radio station s sales go to working capital 
as a result  we have allowed for working capital in the amount of of the station s incremental net revenues for each year of the projection period 
after subtracting federal and state taxes and accounting for the additions to working capital  we determined net free cash flows 
valuation allowance on deferred taxes in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of asc  the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
we have a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of these net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made stock based compensation stock based compensation expense recognized under asc  compensation share based payment asc  for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million respectively  before income taxes 
upon adopting asc  for awards with service conditions  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for restricted stock awards with performance conditions  we have evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and have adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
trade transactions we provide advertising time in exchange for certain products  supplies and services 
we include the value of such exchanges in both station revenues and station operating expenses 
trade valuation is based upon our management s estimate of the fair value of the products  supplies and services received 
for the years ended december   and  amounts reflected under trade transactions were trade revenues of million  million and million  respectively  and trade expenses of million  million and million  respectively

this asu updates asc  intangibles goodwill and other  to amend the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the guidance will be effective for us on january  the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asu in december  the fasb issued clarification of the accounting guidance around disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occur in the current reporting period 
the guidance requires us to present pro forma information in our comparative financial statements as if the acquisition date for any business combinations taking place in the current reporting period had occurred at the beginning of the prior year reporting period 
we will adopt this guidance effective january   and will include any required pro forma information for the proposed acquisition of cmp  which is expected to be completed in the first half of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in may  we entered into a forward starting effective march libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
in may  we also entered into an interest rate option agreement the may option  which provides for bank of america to unilaterally extend the period of the may swap for two additional years  from march  through march  this option was exercised on march  by bank of america 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  that are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk none of our operations are measured in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are not subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
