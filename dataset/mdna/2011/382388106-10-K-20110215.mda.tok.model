you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty for a discussion of certain of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial and general aviation airplane markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global defense and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
key market channels for products and services  growth drivers and industry and our highlights we participate in three key market channels commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane original equipment oe  commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket  and defense and space 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe includes sales of products and services for new airplanes produced by airbus and boeing  and regional  business and small airplane manufacturers 
the key growth drivers in this market channel include the number of orders for the manufacturers airplanes  which will be delivered to their customers over a period of several years  oe manufacturer production and delivery rates for in service airplanes such as the airbus a and boeing ng  and introductions of new airplane models such as the boeing and and the airbus a xwb  and engine types such as the pratt and whitney purepower tm pwg 
we have significant sales content on most of the airplanes manufactured in this market channel 
over the last few years  we have benefited from the historically high production rates and deliveries of airbus and boeing airplanes and from our substantial content on many of the regional and general aviation airplanes 
boeing and airbus have announced production rate increases for and beyond 
however  production rates are always subject to change and may be affected by economic conditions which may influence customers willingness and or ability to purchase new aircraft 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket the commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket channel includes sales of products and services for existing commercial and general aviation airplanes  primarily to airlines and package carriers around the world 
we have significant product content on most of the airplane models that are currently in service and we will benefit from having excellent positions on the newer  more fuel efficient airplanes currently in service 
the key growth drivers in this channel include worldwide passenger capacity 
table of contents growth measured by available seat miles asm and the size  type and utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet 
other important factors affecting growth in this market channel are the age and types of the airplanes in the fleet  fuel prices  airline maintenance practices  gross domestic product gdp trends in countries and regions around the world and domestic and international air freight activity 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asm  is expected to grow in as compared to due in large part to the expected global economic recovery 
asm are expected to increase approximately to in asm expectations could be adversely affected if airlines choose to fly their in service airplanes less frequently  or temporarily ground airplanes due to decreased demand  high fuel prices and other factors including weaker than expected global economic recovery 
defense and space worldwide defense and space sales include sales to prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin  the us government and foreign companies and governments 
the key growth drivers in this channel include the level of defense spending by the us and foreign governments  the number of new platform starts  the level of military flight operations  the level of upgrade  overhaul and maintenance activities associated with existing platforms and demand for optical surveillance and reconnaissance systems 
the market for our defense and space products is global and is not dependent on any single program  platform or customer 
we anticipate fewer new fighter and transport aircraft platform starts over the next several years 
we also anticipate that the introduction of the f lightning ii and new helicopter platforms  along with upgrades on existing defense and space platforms  will provide long term growth opportunities in this market channel 
additionally  we are participating in  and developing new products for  the expanding intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance sector  which should further strengthen our position in this market channel 
long term sustainable growth we believe we are well positioned to grow our sales  organically and through acquisitions  over the long term due to awards for key products on important new and expected programs  including the airbus a xwb  the boeing and  the pratt whitney purepower tm pwg engine and the lockheed martin f lightning ii  the large installed base on commercial airplanes and our strong positions on newer  more fuel efficient airplanes  which should fuel sustained long term aftermarket strength  balance in the commercial airplane market  with strong sales to airbus  boeing and the regional and business jet airplane manufacturers  aging of existing large commercial and regional airplane fleets  which should result in increased aftermarket support  increased number of long term agreements for product and service sales on new and existing commercial airplanes  increased opportunities for aftermarket growth due to airline outsourcing  
table of contents growth in global maintenance  repair and overhaul mro opportunities for our systems and components  particularly in europe  asia and the middle east  where we have expanded our capacity  and expansion of our product offerings in support of high growth areas in the defense and space market channel  such as helicopter products and systems  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance products and precision guidance systems for munitions

see note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
higher pension and postretirement benefits expense the increase in pension and postretirement benefits expense was primarily due to the investment losses of our plan assets in partially offset by the effect of a higher discount rate 
changes in estimates on long term contracts during and  we revised estimates on certain of our long term contracts  primarily in our aerostructures and aircraft wheels and brakes businesses  resulting in lower income of approximately million compared to these revisions were primarily related to favorable cost and operational performance  changes in volume expectations and to some extent  sales pricing improvements on follow on contracts

table of contents approximately million of higher net gains on forward contracts we entered into to offset the impact of net monetary asset gains losses 
higher restructuring costs the increase in restructuring costs was primarily due to severance costs during income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased primarily due to the favorable resolution of an insurance claim related to a past environmental matter in partially offset by a gain on the sale of a previously discontinued business in that did not recur in outlook we expect the following approximate results for the year ending december  outlook actual sales billion to billion billion diluted eps income from continuing operations attributable to goodrich to per share per share diluted eps net income attributable to goodrich to per share per share capital expenditures million to million million operating cash flow minus capital expenditures exceed of net income attributable to goodrich of net income attributable to goodrich our sales and net income outlook does not include the impact of potential acquisitions  divestitures or restructuring activities 
our outlook includes  among other factors lower worldwide pre tax pension expense of approximately million  or per diluted share 
the estimate for pension expense is based on a actual return on us plan assets of and a us discount rate of  both of which reflect conditions as of december  the lower pension expense is primarily the result of actuarial changes  including the change in the amortization period for gains and losses for our us salaried plan  the benefit of million in incremental contributions that we made in and favorable returns on our plan assets

liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements and other liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
we believe our internal liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing plans and commitments  including our share repurchase program  and also provide adequate financial flexibility due to our strong balance sheet  lack of any large near term funding requirements and a strong banking group with a committed credit facility 
the following events have affected our liquidity and capital resources during we paid dividends of per share on january  april  july and october and a dividend of per share on december  we repurchased million shares for million under our share repurchase program  we contributed approximately million to our worldwide qualified and non qualified pension plans  on june   we acquired crompton technology group  ltd

estimates of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments represent our best estimates based on our valuation models  which incorporate industry data and trends and relevant market rates and transactions 
counterparties to these financial instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance  however  we do not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
counterparties  in most cases  are large commercial banks that also provide us with our committed credit facilities 
to manage this credit risk  we select counterparties based on credit ratings  limit our exposure to any single counterparty and monitor our market position with each counterparty

at certain sites we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are based on current facts  laws  regulations and technology 
these estimates take into consideration our prior experience and professional judgment of our environmental specialists 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites  third party indemnity obligations or contractual obligations  and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the accrued liability for environmental remediation were included in accrued expenses 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with previously owned businesses 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will generally complete remediation in less than years at sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
certain states in the us and countries globally are promulgating or proposing new or more demanding regulations or legislation impacting the use of various chemical substances by all companies 
we continue to evaluate the potential impact  if any  of new regulations and legislation 

table of contents asbestos we and some of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging damages as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products or at formerly owned facilities 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
insurance coverage we maintain a comprehensive portfolio of insurance policies  including aviation products liability insurance which covers most of our products 
the aviation products liability insurance typically provides first dollar coverage for defense and indemnity of third party claims 
a portion of our historical primary and excess layers of pre insurance coverage for third party claims was provided by certain insurance carriers who are either insolvent  undergoing solvent schemes of arrangement or in run off 
we have entered into settlement agreements with a number of these insurers pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to certain insurance policies in exchange for negotiated payments 
these settlements represent negotiated payments for our loss of insurance coverage  as we no longer have this insurance available for claims that may have qualified for coverage 
a portion of these settlements was recorded as income for reimbursement of past claim payments under the settled insurance policies and a portion was recorded as a deferred settlement credit for future claim payments 
at december  and  the deferred settlement credit was million and million  respectively  for which million and million  respectively  was reported in accrued expenses and million and million  respectively  was reported in other non current liabilities 
the proceeds from such insurance settlements were reported as a component of net cash provided by operating activities in the period payments were received 
liabilities of divested businesses in connection with the divestitures of our tire  vinyl  engineered industrial products and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental  asbestos and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees at december   we had letters of credit and bank guarantees of million and residual value guarantees of lease obligations of million 
see note  financing arrangements and note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we were a guarantor on a revolving credit agreement totaling million between the jv and a financial institution 
in addition  we guarantee the jv s foreign exchange credit line with a notional amount of million and a fair value asset of million at december  we are indemnified by rolls royce for of the gains losses resulting from the foreign exchange hedges 
aerostructures long term contracts our aerostructures business in the nacelles and interior systems segment has several long term contracts in the pre production phase  including the airbus a xwb and the pratt and whitney purepower tm pwg engine contracts  and in the early production phase  including 
table of contents the boeing these contracts are accounted for in accordance with long term construction contract accounting 
the pre production phase includes design of the product to meet customer specifications as well as design of the processes to manufacture the product 
also involved in this phase is securing the supply of material and subcomponents produced by third party suppliers  generally accomplished through long term supply agreements 
contracts in the early production phase include excess over average inventories  which represent the excess of current manufactured cost over the estimated average manufactured cost during the life of the contract 
cost estimates over the lives of contracts are affected by estimates of future cost reductions including learning curve efficiencies 
because these contracts cover manufacturing periods of up to years or more  there is risk associated with the estimates of future costs made during the pre production and early production phases 
these estimates may be different from actual costs due to various factors  including the following ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements  including overhead absorption  related to new  or changes to  manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing  including escalation where applicable  potential supplier claims  the supplier s financial viability and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
additionally  total contract revenue is based on estimates of future units to be delivered to the customer  the ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims and sales price escalation  where applicable 
there is a risk that there could be differences between the actual units delivered and the estimated total units to be delivered under the contract and differences in actual revenues compared to estimates 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined to the extent total estimated costs exceed total estimated contract revenues 
aerostructures contract with boeing during  our aerostructures business entered into a long term contract with boeing on the program 
our latest outlook estimates original equipment sales in excess of billion for this contract 
aftermarket sales associated with this program are not accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the boeing program has experienced delays in its development schedule 
boeing requested changes and enhancements in the design of our product 
under the terms of our contract  we were entitled to equitable adjustments 
in accordance with these provisions  we asserted adjustments that were material 
during  we finalized an agreement with boeing that resolved the assertions 
the financial terms of the agreement were consistent with our outlook and did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows

as of december   we have approximately million net of advances of million of pre production costs and inventory related to this program 
future program funding remains uncertain and there can be no assurance of such funding

us health care reform legislation in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability act of the act were enacted 
the primary focus of the act is to significantly reform health care in the us the financial impact on us that was recognized in was the elimination of a portion of the tax deduction available to companies that provide prescription drug coverage to retirees as discussed in note  income taxes 
in addition  we have included the potential impact of the excise tax in the valuation of our opeb liability as of december  we continue to evaluate the various provisions of the act 
tax we are continuously undergoing examination by the us internal revenue service irs  as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions 
the irs and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported by us on our income tax returns 
tax years and during  the irs issued a revenue agent s report for the tax years and in july  we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to certain unresolved issues which involve the proper timing of deductions 
although it is reasonably possible that these matters could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
tax years to during  we reached agreement with the irs on substantially all of the issues raised with respect to the examination of taxable years to we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to the remaining unresolved issues which involve the proper timing of certain deductions 
we were unable to reach agreement with the irs on the remaining issues 
in december  we filed a petition in the us tax court and in march we also filed a complaint in the federal district court 
if the irs were to prevail  we believe the amount of the estimated tax liability is fully reserved 
we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of a final resolution of the remaining unresolved issues 
tax years prior to the previous examination cycle included the consolidated income tax groups for the audit periods identified below coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr  inc rohr and coltec we previously reached final settlement with the irs on all but one of the issues raised in this examination cycle 
we received statutory notices of deficiency dated june  related to 
table of contents the remaining unresolved issue which involves the proper timing of certain deductions 
we filed a petition with the us tax court in september to contest the notices of deficiency 
we reached a tentative agreement with the irs to settle the remaining unresolved issue but due to the size of the potential refund  the agreement required approval by the joint committee on taxation jct 
in january  the jct approved the terms of the settlement agreement 
the us tax court is in the process of evaluating the terms of the settlement agreement and processing the litigants request to dismiss the matter 
if the us tax court accepts the settlement agreement  we expect to recognize a tax benefit of approximately million in rohr was examined by the state of california for the tax years ended july   and the state of california disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s franchise tax board held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions 
in addition  california audited our amended tax returns filed to reflect the changes resulting from the settlement of the us tax court for rohr s tax years to california issued an assessment based on numerous issues including proper timing of deductions and allowance of tax credits 
in october  we reached a comprehensive settlement with the california franchise tax board on all issues for through we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter of new accounting standards not yet adopted as of december   there were no new accounting standards applicable to us that have not yet been adopted 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  share based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract accounting percentage of completion we have sales under long term contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
we use the cumulative catch up method in accounting for changes in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of changes in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 

table of contents amounts representing contract claims or change orders are considered in estimating revenues  costs and profits when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
estimates of revenue and cost for our contracts span a period of many years from the inception of the contracts to the date of actual shipments and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying factors are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the assumptions of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the factors change 
the factors include but are not limited to estimates of the following escalation of future sales prices under the contracts  ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements  including overhead absorption  related to new  or changes to  manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing  including escalation where applicable  potential supplier claims  the supplier s financial viability and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
during the early years of a contract  manufacturing costs per unit delivered are typically greater than the estimated average unit cost for the total contract 
this excess manufacturing cost for units shipped results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
see note  inventories  to our consolidated financial statements 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period identified  thus reducing inventory to its estimated realizable value 
progress payments and advances are classified as a reduction of inventory when they represent non refundable payments for work in process and cash received from government customers where the government has legal title to the work in process 
unbilled receivables our aerostructures business is party to a long term supply arrangement whereby we receive cash payments for our performance over a period that extends beyond our performance period of the contract 
the contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
unbilled receivables include revenue recognized that will be realized from cash payments to be received beyond the period of performance 
in estimating our revenues to be received under the contract  cash receipts that are expected to be received beyond the 
table of contents performance period are included at their present value as of the end of the performance period 
product maintenance arrangements we have entered into long term product maintenance arrangements to provide specific products and services to customers for a specified amount per flight hour  brake landing and or aircraft landings 
revenue is recognized as the service is performed and the costs are incurred 
we have sufficient historical evidence that indicates that the costs of performing the service under the contract are incurred on other than a straight line basis 
income taxes as of each reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
in addition  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions and record interest net of any applicable tax benefit on potential tax contingencies as a component of our tax expense 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjective and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually  or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is november we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the amount of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
based upon the assumptions as of our november  testing date  none of our reporting units were at risk of their book value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any impairment exists 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by a long term growth rate and a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital at the date of evaluation 
impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or related groups of assets may not be recoverable  and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption 
table of contents is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
changes to these assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment 
other assets as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of participation payments  sales incentives and flight certification costs 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated with acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
participation payments certain of our businesses make cash payments under long term contractual arrangements to oem or system contractors in return for a secured position on an aircraft program 
participation payments are capitalized  when a contractual liability has been incurred  as other assets and amortized as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of participation payments was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of participation payments is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of units or a revision in the economics of the program 
if such estimates change  amortization expense is adjusted and or an impairment charge is recorded  as appropriate  for the effect of the revised estimates 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives such as up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of sales incentives was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of sales incentives is evaluated for recovery when indicators of potential impairment exist 
the carrying value of the sales incentives is also compared annually to the amount recoverable under the terms of the guarantee in the customer contract 
if the amount of the carrying value of the sales incentives exceeds the amount recoverable in the contract  the carrying value is reduced 
no significant impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
flight certification costs when a supply arrangement is secured  certain of our businesses may agree to supply hardware to an oem to be used in flight certification testing and or make cash payments to reimburse an 
table of contents oem for costs incurred in testing the hardware 
the flight certification testing is necessary to certify aircraft systems components for the aircraft s airworthiness and allows the aircraft to be flown and thus sold in the country certifying the aircraft 
flight certification costs are capitalized in other assets and are amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of flight certification costs was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of flight certification costs is evaluated for recovery when indicators of impairment exist or when the estimated number of units to be manufactured changes 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
service and product warranties we provide service and warranty policies on certain of our products 
we accrue liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues 
our service and product warranty reserves are based upon a variety of factors 
any significant change in these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations 
such factors include but are not limited to the following the historical performance of our products and changes in performance of newer products  the mix and volumes of products being sold  and the impact of product changes 
share based compensation we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
see note  share based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements 
assumptions stock options we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the expected value that our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions  such as interest rates  employee exercises  our stock price and expected dividend yield 
our weighted average assumptions included estimated risk free interest rate expected dividend yield historical volatility factor weighted average expected life of the options years the expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate  historical volatility and expected dividend yield must be applied 
the expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options 
it is based on our historical experience with similar grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the expected us treasury rate over the expected life 
historical volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
expected dividend yield is based on the stated dividend rate as of the date of grant 

table of contents restricted stock units the fair value of the restricted stock units is determined based upon the average of the high and low grant date fair value 
the weighted average grant date fair value is estimated to be for and was  and per unit during  and  respectively 
performance units the value of each award is determined based upon the average of the high and low price of our stock on the last day of each reporting period  as adjusted for a performance condition and a market condition 
the performance condition is applied to of the awards and is based upon our actual return on invested capital roic as compared to a target roic 
the market condition is applied to of the awards and is based on our relative total shareholder return rtsr as compared to the rtsr of a peer group of companies 
since the awards will be paid in cash  they are recorded as a liability award and are marked to market each reporting period 
as such  assumptions are evaluated for each award on an ongoing basis 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions we consult with an outside actuary as to the appropriateness for many of the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our worldwide pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions 
all significant assumptions are evaluated at least annually 
assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase  health care cost projections  the mortality rate assumption  and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data  as well as our outlook for the future 
the us and the uk discount rates are determined using a bond settlement approach based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose coupon payments and maturity values are designed to match the projected benefit payment cash flows of the underlying pension and opeb obligations 
only high quality aa graded or better  non callable corporate bonds are included in this bond portfolio 
the discount rate for canada resulted from benchmark plans with similar durations as the canadian plans  plotted against the respective canadian yield curves of aa graded corporate bonds 
the appropriate benchmarks by applicable country are used for pension plans other than those in the us  us and canada 
see note  pensions and postretirement benefits 
we generally amortize the actuarial gains and losses for our pension plans over the average future service period of the active participants 
however  in  we will amortize the actuarial gains and losses over the remaining life of the plan participants in our us salaried plan since almost all of the plan participants in that plan are now inactive 
additionally  as of january  we reduced the expected long term rate of return assumption for the us and us plan assets to

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities in our consolidated financial statements for a description of current developments involving our hedging activities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
at december  we had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates

these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted our business segments financial results in approximately of our revenues and approximately of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
approximately of these net costs are in great britain pounds sterling  euros  canadian dollars  polish zlotys and indian rupee 
we hedge a portion of our exposure of us dollar sales on an ongoing basis 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros and polish zlotys 
these forward contracts are used to 
table of contents mitigate a portion of the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had the following forward contracts currency notional amount buy sell dollars in millions great britain pounds sterling buy euros buy canadian dollars buy polish zlotys buy these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to december at december   a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was an asset of million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods 
in addition to the foreign exchange cash flow hedges  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts generally mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
as of december   our contracts had a notional amount of million and a fair value of a million net liability
