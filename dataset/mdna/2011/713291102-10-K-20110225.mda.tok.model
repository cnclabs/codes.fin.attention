table of contents pepco holdings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc general overview pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings  a delaware corporation incorporated in  is a holding company that  through its regulated public utility subsidiaries  is engaged primarily in the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity and the distribution and supply of natural gas power delivery 
through pepco energy services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  pepco energy services  phi provides energy efficiency services primarily to government and institutional customers and is in the process of winding down its competitive electricity and natural gas retail supply business 
each of power delivery and pepco energy services constitutes a separate segment for financial reporting purposes 
a third segment  other non regulated  owns a portfolio of eight cross border energy lease investments 
the following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income from continuing operations attributable to the power delivery  pepco energy services and other non regulated segments december  percentage of consolidated operating revenue power delivery pepco energy services other non regulated percentage of consolidated operating income power delivery pepco energy services other non regulated percentage of power delivery operating revenue power delivery electric power delivery gas power delivery power delivery electric consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity  and power delivery gas consists of the delivery and supply of natural gas 
power delivery represents a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
the power delivery business is conducted by phi s three utility subsidiaries potomac electric power company pepco  delmarva power light company dpl and atlantic city electric company ace 
each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission 
each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service is standard office service sos in delaware  the district of columbia and maryland and basic generation service bgs in new jersey 
in this form k  these supply service obligations are referred to generally as default electricity supply 

table of contents pepco holdings pepco  dpl and ace are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc approved formula methodology 
the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
the power delivery operating results historically have been seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
operating results also can be affected by economic conditions  energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity 
as a result of the implementation of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers of pepco and dpl in maryland in june and for customers of pepco in the district of columbia in november  pepco and dpl recognize distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue 
as a result of the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either i a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland and district and columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or ii a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
pepco energy services the business of the pepco energy services segment has consisted primarily of i the retail supply of electricity and natural gas and ii providing energy savings performance contracting services principally to federal  state and local government customers  and designing  constructing and operating combined heat and power and central energy plants for customers energy services 
pepco energy services also owns and operates two oil fired generation facilities 
in december  phi announced that it will wind down the retail energy supply component of the pepco energy services business 
the decision was made after considering  among other factors  the return phi earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments 
to effectuate the wind down  pepco energy services will continue to fulfill all of its commercial and regulatory obligations and perform its customer service functions to ensure that it meets the needs of its existing customers  but will not be entering into any new retail energy supply contracts 
operating revenues related to the retail energy supply business for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively  and operating income for the same periods was million  million and million  respectively 
phi expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable through december   based on its existing contract backlog and its corresponding portfolio of wholesale hedges  with immaterial losses beyond that date 
substantially all of pepco energy services retail customer obligations will be fully performed by june  
table of contents pepco holdings in connection with the operation of the retail energy supply business  as of december  and  pepco energy services has collateral pledged to counterparties primarily for the instruments it uses to hedge commodity price risk of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the december  collateral amount  million was in the form of letters of credit and million was posted in cash 
pepco energy services estimates that at current market prices  with the wind down of the retail energy supply business  this collateral will be released as follows an aggregate of by december   an aggregate of by december   and substantially all collateral by june  as a result of the decision to wind down the retail energy supply business  pepco energy services in the fourth quarter of recorded i a million pre tax impairment charge reflecting the write off of all goodwill allocated to the business and ii a pre tax charge of less than million related to employee severance 
pepco energy services remaining businesses will not be affected by the wind down of the retail energy supply business 
other non regulated through its subsidiary potomac capital investment corporation  phi maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments with a book value at december  of approximately billion 
this activity constitutes a third operating segment  which is designated as other non regulated  for financial reporting purposes 
for a discussion of phi s cross border energy lease investments  see note  commitments and contingencies regulatory and other matters phi s cross border energy lease investments  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
discontinued operations on april   the board of directors of phi approved a plan for the disposition of conectiv energy  which is comprised of conectiv energy holding company and its subsidiaries 
on july   phi completed the sale of conectiv energy s wholesale power generation business to calpine for billion 
the disposition of all of conectiv energy s remaining assets and businesses not included in the calpine sale  including its load service supply contracts  energy hedging portfolio and certain tolling agreements  has been substantially completed 
the operations of conectiv energy  which previously comprised a separate segment for financial reporting purposes  have been classified as a discontinued operation in phi s consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended december  and the business is no longer being treated as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  all references to continuing operations exclude the operations of the former conectiv energy segment 

table of contents pepco holdings business strategy phi s business strategy is to remain a mid atlantic regional energy distribution utility company focused on value creation  operational excellence and environmental responsibility 
the components of this strategy include achieving earnings growth in the power delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes  while maintaining a high level of operational excellence 
pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency  energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
supplementing phi s utility earnings through pepco energy services by providing energy performance services and renewable energy and combined heat and power alternatives to commercial  industrial and government customers 
to further this business strategy  phi may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses  including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses  as well as possible acquisitions 
phi also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors  including the requirements of its businesses  competitive conditions and regulatory requirements

table of contents pepco holdings discussion of operating segment net income variances power delivery s million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following million increase from higher distribution revenue consisting of a million increase due to distribution rate increases pepco in the district of columbia effective november and march  dpl in maryland effective december  dpl in delaware effective april  and ace in new jersey effective june  and a million increase due to higher distribution sales  primarily due to weather  usage and growth in the number of customers 
million increase from higher transmission revenue primarily due to higher rates effective june  related to an increase in transmission plant investment 
million increase in other income expense  primarily an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction and gains on the disposal of assets 
million increase associated with ace basic generation service primarily attributable to an increase in unbilled revenue due to higher usage and higher rates 
the aggregate of these increases was partially offset by million decrease due to higher operating and maintenance costs primarily resulting from february  july and august storm restoration activity  system maintenance tree trimming and estimated environmental remediation costs 
million decrease due to the favorable earnings impact of the approvals by the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc and the maryland public service commission mpsc of pepco s proposals for sharing the proceeds of the mirant bankruptcy settlement remaining after the transfer of the panda ppa to a third party 
million decrease due to a restructuring charge recorded in million decrease related to income tax adjustments consisting of million decrease due to earnings impact of a maryland income tax benefit related to a change in tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years  offset by million net increase due to the impact of interest related to effectively settled and uncertain tax positions in million decrease due to a order by the dcpsc associated with the effects of pepco divestiture related claims 
pepco energy services million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the following million decrease due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the retail electricity supply business  and lower gross margins due to low demand in the retail natural gas business 

table of contents pepco holdings million decrease due to repair costs associated with a thermal services distribution system pipe leak and higher costs associated with operating a customer s cogeneration plant  partially offset by increased high voltage construction activity 
the aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by million increase due to higher electricity generation output that resulted from warmer than normal weather  partially offset by power plant maintenance costs 
million increase due to lower interest and other expenses  primarily associated with credit and collateral facilities for the retail energy supply business 
other non regulated s million decrease in earnings is primarily due to favorable income tax benefits recorded in corporate and other s million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of million of debt extinguishment costs related to the purchase of outstanding debt with the proceeds from the sale of the conectiv energy wholesale power generation business  partially offset by the favorable impact of million of net state income tax benefits related to the april corporate restructuring and million of lower interest expense 
the million decrease in earnings from discontinued operations was primarily due to the recognition of a loss associated with the sale of the wholesale power generation business to calpine corporation and unrealized losses on derivative instruments no longer qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting  partially offset by gains recognized on sales of load service supply contracts

in addition to increased organizational flexibility and reduced administrative costs  converting these entities to limited liability companies allows phi to include income or losses in the former corporations in a single state income tax return  thus increasing the utilization of state income tax attributes 
as a result of inclusions of income or losses in a single state return as discussed above  phi recorded an million benefit by reversing a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and an additional benefit of million resulting from changes to certain state deferred tax benefits

in connection with the settlement  phi reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the irs since among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years 
in light of the settlement and reallocations  phi has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years to the revised estimate has resulted in the reversal of million of previously accrued estimated interest due to the irs 
this reversal has been recorded as an income tax benefit in  and is subject to adjustment when the irs finalizes its calculation of the amount due

the million net liability on energy contracts at december  was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases for delivery to retail customers under fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging asc 
prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the year  which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of pepco energy services and conectiv energy 
pepco energy services recorded unrealized losses of million on energy contracts in aocl as these energy contracts were effective hedges under the fasb guidance 
phi expects that when these energy contracts settle  the related realized gains or losses will be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations with its customers

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of phi or the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   a downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of phi or each of its rated subsidiaries to below investment grade would increase the collateral obligation of phi and its subsidiaries by up to million  million of which is related to the discontinued operations of conectiv energy  and million of which is the net settlement amount attributable to derivatives  normal purchase and normal sale contracts  collateral  and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi  set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
the remaining million of the collateral obligation that would be incurred in the event phi were downgraded to below investment grade is attributable primarily to energy services contracts and accounts payable to independent system operators and distribution companies on full requirements contracts entered into by pepco energy services 
phi believes that it and its utility subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and default electricity supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements

approximately  is expected to be incurred in sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  dividends  and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of phi s potential funding sources 
see item a  risk factors  of this form k for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
cash flow from operations cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business is the primary source of phi s cash flow from operations 
additional cash flows are generated by the business of pepco energy services and from the occasional sale of non core assets 

table of contents pepco holdings short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco and dpl have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million each  and ace up to million 
the commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to days 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities the issuance of debt securities by phi s principal subsidiaries requires the approval of either ferc or one or more state public utility commissions 
neither ferc approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by phi 
state financing authority pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the dcpsc and mpsc 
dpl s long term financing activities are subject to authorization by the mpsc and the delaware public service commission 
ace s long term and short term consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less financing activities are subject to authorization by the njbpu 
each utility  through periodic filings with the state public service commission s having jurisdiction over its financing activities  typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 
ferc financing authority under the federal power act fpa  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by pepco and dpl 
pepco and dpl have obtained ferc authority for the issuance of short term debt 
because pepco energy services also qualifies as a public utility under the fpa and is not regulated by a state utility commission  ferc also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by pepco energy services 
pepco energy services has obtained the requisite ferc financing authority in its market based rate orders 
money pool pepco holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by ferc 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 

table of contents pepco holdings regulatory and other matters rate proceedings distribution the rates that each of pepco  dpl and ace is permitted to charge for the retail distribution of electricity and natural gas to its various classes of customers are based on the principle that the utility is entitled to generate an amount of revenue sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service  including a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital 
these base rates are intended to cover all of each utility s reasonable and prudent expenses of constructing  operating and maintaining its distribution facilities other than costs covered by specific cost recovery surcharges 
a change in base rates in a jurisdiction requires the approval of public service commission 
in the rate application submitted to the public service commission  the utility specifies an increase in its revenue requirement  which is the additional revenue that the utility is seeking authorization to earn 
the revenue requirement consists of i the allowable expenses incurred by the utility  including operation and maintenance expenses  taxes and depreciation  and ii the utility s cost of capital 
the compensation of the utility for its cost of capital takes the form of an overall rate of return allowed by the public service commission on the utility s distribution rate base to compensate the utility s investors for their debt and equity investments in the company 
the rate base is the aggregate value of the investment in property used by the utility in providing electricity and natural gas distribution services and generally consists of plant in service net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred taxes  plus cash working capital  material and operating supplies and  depending on the jurisdiction  construction work in progress 
over time  the rate base is increased by utility property additions and reduced by depreciation and property retirements and write offs 
in addition to its base rates  some of the costs of providing distribution service are recovered through the operation of surcharges 
examples of costs recovered by phi s utility subsidiaries through surcharges  which vary depending on the jurisdiction  include a surcharge to reimburse the utility for the cost of purchasing electricity from non utility generation sources new jersey  surcharges to reimburse the utility for costs of public interest programs for low income customers new jersey  maryland  delaware and the district of columbia  a surcharge to pay the transitional bond charge new jersey  and surcharges to reimburse the utility for certain environmental costs delaware and maryland 
each utility subsidiary regularly reviews its distribution rates in each jurisdiction of its service territory  and from time to time files applications to adjust its rates as necessary in an effort to ensure that its revenues are sufficient to cover its operating expenses and its cost of capital 
the timing of future rate filings and the change in the distribution rate requested will depend on a number of factors  including changes in revenues and expenses and the incurrence or the planned incurrence of capital expenditures 
in  pepco currently expects to file an electricity base rate increase application in the district of columbia and maryland  and ace currently expects to file an electricity base rate increase application in new jersey 
dpl currently expects to file a natural gas base rate increase application in early in general  a request for new distribution rates is made on the basis of test year balances for rate base allowable operating expenses and a requested rate of return 
the test year amounts used in the filing may be historical or partially projected 
the public service commission may  however  select a different test period than that proposed by the company 
although the approved tariff rates are intended to be forward looking  and therefore provide for the recovery of some future changes in rate base and operating costs  they typically do not reflect all of the changes in costs for the period in which the new rates are in effect 

table of contents pepco holdings if revenues do not keep pace with increases in costs  this will result in a lag between when the costs are incurred and when the utility can begin to recover those costs through its rates 
the following table shows  for each of the phi utility subsidiaries  the authorized return on equity as determined in the most recently concluded base rate proceeding and the date as of which the rate as determined in the proceeding was implemented rate base in millions authorized return on equity rate effective date pepco district of columbia electricity march maryland electricity july dpl delaware electricity february maryland electricity december delaware natural gas april ace new jersey electricity june transmission the rates pepco  dpl and ace are permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity are regulated by ferc and are based on each utility s transmission rate base  transmission operating expenses and an overall rate of return that is approved by ferc 
for each utility subsidiary  ferc has approved a formula for the calculation of the company s transmission rate  which is referred to as a formula rate 
the formula rates include both fixed and variable elements 
certain of the fixed elements  such as the return on equity and depreciation rates  can be changed only in a ferc rate proceeding 
the variable elements of the formula  including the utility s rate base and operating expenses  are updated annually  effective june of each year  with data from the utility s most recent annual ferc form filing 
in addition to its formula rate  each utility s return on equity is supplemented by incentive rates  sometimes referred to as adders  and other incentives  which are authorized by ferc to promote capital investment in transmission infrastructure 
for example  in connection with the mapp project  ferc has authorized for each of pepco and dpl a basis point adder to its return on equity  resulting in a ferc approved rate of return on the mapp project of  along with full recovery of construction work in progress and prudently incurred abandoned plant costs 
additional return on equity adders are in effect for each of pepco  dpl and ace relating to specific transmission upgrades and improvements  as well as in consideration for each utility s continued membership in pjm 
as members of pjm  the transmission rates of pepco  dpl and ace are set out in pjm s open access transmission tariff

table of contents pepco holdings critical accounting policies general pepco holdings has identified the following accounting policies  including certain estimates  that as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
pepco holdings has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill impairment evaluation substantially all of phi s goodwill was generated by pepco s acquisition of conectiv in and is allocated entirely to the power delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under fasb guidance on goodwill and other intangibles asc 
management has identified power delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components which have similar economic characteristics  similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for power delivery when estimating the reporting unit s fair value 
in addition  phi selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows 
these judgments are inherently uncertain  and actual results could vary from those used in phi s estimates 
the impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test  which could materially impact the estimated fair value of power delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements 
phi tests its goodwill impairment at least annually as of november and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors that may result in an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to a change in identified reporting units  an adverse change in business conditions  a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value  an adverse regulatory action  or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit 
phi s november  annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
see note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements of phi  set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
although phi s market capitalization remained below book value as of december   phi did not perform an interim goodwill impairment test because its market capitalization relative to book value improved compared to earlier periods in which it performed an interim impairment test and there were no other indicators of potential impairment 
phi performed interim tests of goodwill for impairment as of march  and as of december  as its market capitalization was below its book value at both points in time and its market capitalization relative to book value had significantly declined 
phi concluded that its goodwill was not impaired at these interim dates 
in order to estimate the fair value of the power delivery reporting unit  phi uses two valuation techniques an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using estimated future cash flows and a terminal value that is consistent with power delivery s long term view of the business 
this approach uses a discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital wacc for the reporting unit 
phi determines the estimated wacc by considering market based information for the cost of equity and cost of debt that is appropriate for the power delivery business as of the measurement date 
the market approach estimates fair value based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda that management believes is consistent with ebitda multiples for comparable utilities 
phi has consistently used this valuation framework to estimate the fair value of power delivery 

table of contents pepco holdings the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the power delivery reporting unit s business forecast  including but not limited to interest rates  growth assumptions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditure requirements  and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience 
a hypothetical percent decrease in fair value of the power delivery reporting unit at november  would not have resulted in the power delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test  as defined in the guidance  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value 
sensitive  interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the power delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance  sustained adverse business conditions  change in forecasted revenues  higher operating and maintenance capital expenditure requirements  a significant increase in the cost of capital  and other factors 
phi believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments  and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about when events indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and how to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property  plant  and equipment 
the fasb guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as i a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  v a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  and vi a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
if necessary  the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above 

table of contents pepco holdings accounting for derivatives pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas  any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements i the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives  ii the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting  iii the application of cash flow hedge accounting  and iv the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items  which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or  in certain circumstances  significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from pepco holdings estimates 
see note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives  and note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi  set forth in part ii  item of this form k for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices 
the definition of a derivative in the fasb guidance results in management having to exercise judgment  such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts 
management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting  including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity 
the application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available 
for certain long dated instruments  broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where information is limited 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  which affect the reported amount of annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement 
assumptions about the future  including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
the discount rate for determining the pension benefit obligation was and as of december  and  respectively 
the discount rate for determining the postretirement benefit obligation was and as of december  and  respectively 
phi utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to select the discount rate 
the analytical tool utilizes a high quality bond portfolio with cash flows that match the benefit payments expected to be made under the plans 

table of contents pepco holdings the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was and as of december  and  respectively 
in selecting an expected long term rate of return on plan assets  phi considers actual historical returns  economic forecasts and the judgment of its investment consultants on expected long term performance for the types of investments held by the plan 
the estimated asset class returns are weighted by phi s target asset allocation 
the plan assets consist of equity  fixed income investments  real estate and private equity  and when viewed over a long term horizon  are expected to yield a return on assets of as of december  assumptions about the future  including the expected return on plan assets  discount rate applied to benefit obligations  the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
the following table reflects the effect on the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic cost associated with changing the critical actuarial assumptions while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant in millions  except percentages change in assumptions impact on projected benefit obligation projected increase in net periodic cost pension plan discount rate expected return a postretirement benefit plan discount rate expected return a healthcare cost trend a a change in the expected return assumption has no impact on the projected benefit obligation 
the impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of income 
for additional discussion  see note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements of phi  set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
accounting for regulated activities fasb guidance on the accounting for regulated activities  regulated operations asc  applies to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities 
phi defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable that those costs will be recovered in future rates charged to its customers 
phi defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers 
pepco holdings believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i management must interpret laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs from customers or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred  ii decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii writing off a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future rates charged to customers could have a material negative impact on pepco holdings assets and earnings 

table of contents pepco holdings management s most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral 
in those cases  management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions  the results of recent rate orders  and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item 
management regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities to determine whether adjustments to its previous conclusions are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by pepco holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed 
pepco holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
the calculation is based on the supply of electricity or natural gas distributed to customers but not yet billed and adjusted for estimated line loss estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers 
pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation 
specifically  the determination of estimated line loss is inherently uncertain 
estimated line loss is defined as the estimates of electricity and natural gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers 
a change in estimated line loss can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation 
certain factors can influence the estimated line loss such as weather and a change in customer mix 
these factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory and the impact of changes in these factors could be material 
pepco holdings seeks to reduce the risk of an inaccurate estimate of unbilled revenue through corroboration of the estimate with historical information and other metrics 
accounting for income taxes pepco holdings exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a critical accounting estimate because i it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns  ii it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years  iii it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized  iv it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years  v the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns  vi it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances  and vii it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements and that the benefit recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
pepco holdings assumptions  judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations  interpretation of current tax laws and 
table of contents pepco holdings regulations  the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations  developments in case law  settlements of tax positions  and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities 
pepco holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although pepco holdings believes that these assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
pepco holdings reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly 
pepco holdings also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance 
the forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time  including growth assumptions  business conditions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditures  cost of capital  tax laws and regulations  the legal structure of entities and other factors  which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements

table of contents pepco management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potomac electric power company potomac electric power company pepco meets the conditions set forth in general instruction i a and b to the form k  and accordingly information otherwise required under this item has been omitted in accordance with general instruction i a to the form k 
general overview pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the district of columbia and major portions of montgomery county and prince george s county in suburban maryland 
pepco also provides default electricity supply  which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
default electricity supply is known as standard offer service sos in both the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco s service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to maryland customers and approximately were to the district of columbia customers 
effective june  the maryland public service commission mpsc approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc also approved a bsa for retail customers  effective in november for customers to whom the bsa applies  pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue 
as a result of the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either i a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland and district of columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or ii a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings

an increase of million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses 
the aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by a decrease of million primarily due to pepco deferrals of i february severe winter storm costs and ii distribution rate case costs  which in each case originally had been charged to other operation and maintenance expense 
these deferrals were recorded in accordance with a mpsc rate order issued in august and a dcpsc rate order issued in february  respectively  authorizing the establishment of regulatory assets for the recovery of these costs 
a decrease of million in employee related costs  primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
restructuring charge with the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business of pepco energy services and the disposition of conectiv energy  phi is repositioning itself as a regulated transmission and distribution company 
in connection with this repositioning  phi commenced a comprehensive organizational review in the second quarter of to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and to achieve certain reductions in corporate overhead costs that are allocated to its operating segments 
this review has resulted in the adoption of a restructuring plan 
phi began implementing the plan during the third quarter  identifying employee positions that were eliminated during the fourth quarter of the plan also focuses on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and operational efficiencies 
phi currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will result in an annual reduction of approximately million in corporate overhead costs 
in connection with the plan  pepco recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million for the year ended december   related to severance  pension  and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees

table of contents pepco income tax expense pepco s effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the november settlement phi reached with the internal revenue service irs with respect to its federal tax returns for the years to in connection with the settlement  pepco reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the irs since among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years 
in light of the settlement and reallocations  pepco has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years to the revised estimate has resulted in the reversal of million after tax of previously accrued estimated interest due to the irs 
this reversal has been recorded as an income tax benefit in  and is subject to adjustment when the irs finalizes its calculation of the amount due 
this benefit was partially offset by an million reversal of previously recorded tax benefits and million of other adjustments 
capital requirements sources of capital pepco has a range of capital sources available  in addition to internally generated funds  to meet its long term and short term funding needs 
the sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings  as well as the ability to issue preferred stock 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
pepco traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  including commercial paper  short term notes  bank lines of credit and borrowings under the phi money pool 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs  but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of pepco s potential funding sources 
see item a  risk factors  of this form k  for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on pepco s sources of capital 
debt securities pepco has a mortgage and deed of trust the mortgage under which it issues first mortgage bonds 
first mortgage bonds issued under the mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of pepco s property  plant and equipment 
the principal amount of first mortgage bonds that pepco may issue under the mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds 
pepco also has an indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds and an indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities  including medium term notes

the commercial paper is backed by pepco s borrowing capacity under the phi billion credit facility 
money pool pepco participates in the money pool operated by phi under authorization received from ferc 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by phi and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements 
phi may invest in  but not borrow from  the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by phi 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on phi s short term borrowing rate 
phi deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which phi may obtain from external sources 
preferred stock under its articles of incorporation  pepco is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more series  with each series having such rights  preferences and limitations  including dividend and voting rights and redemption provisions  as the board of directors may establish 
as of december   there were no shares of pepco preferred stock outstanding 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the dcpsc and mpsc 
through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions  pepco generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 
under the federal power act  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  pepco is required to obtain ferc authorization for the issuance of short term debt 
capital expenditures pepco s capital expenditures for the year ended december   totaled million 
these expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services  distribution reliability and transmission 
the expenditures also include an allocation by phi of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit the power delivery business and are allocated to pepco when the assets are placed in service

dpl s electricity distribution service territory covers approximately  square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to delaware customers and approximately were to maryland customers 
in northern delaware  dpl also supplies and distributes natural gas to retail customers and provides transportation only services to retail customers that purchase natural gas from other suppliers 
dpl s natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately  as a result of the implementation of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers of dpl in maryland in june  dpl recognizes maryland distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period with the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue 
as a result of the bsa in maryland  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either i a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that dpl is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or ii a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that dpl is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies for phi and its subsidiaries are determined by phi s corporate risk management committee  the members of which are phi s chief risk officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer and other senior executives 
the corporate risk management committee monitors interest rate fluctuation  commodity price fluctuation  and credit risk exposure  and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements 
for information about phi s derivative activities  other than the information disclosed herein  refer to note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives  note  derivative instruments and hedging activities and note  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
pepco holdings  inc commodity price risk the pepco energy services segment engages in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging accounting standards codification asc 
pepco energy services also manages commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the primary risk management objective is to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins 
the discontinued operations of conectiv energy have engaged in similar commodity risk management activities throughout prior to the sale of the wholesale power generation business on july   the risk management objective of the conectiv energy segment also included the management of the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate its electric generating facilities and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those facilities by selling forward a portion of their projected generating facility output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements 
conectiv energy sold its remaining derivatives in january  and no longer engages in such activities 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the corporate risk management committee  which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as energy commodity activities 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of the energy commodity activities of pepco energy services and conectiv energy 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
in january  phi changed its var estimation model from a delta normal variance covariance model to a delta gamma model 
the other parameters  a percent  one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period  remained the same 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 

table of contents the table below provides the var associated with energy contracts of both the pepco energy services segment and the former conectiv energy segment for the year ended december  in millions of dollars var for conectiv energy commodity activities a var for pepco energy services commodity activities a confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low a these columns represent all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase and normal sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements  and modeled customer load obligations for phi s energy commodity activities 
pepco energy services purchases electric and natural gas futures  swaps  options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for distribution to customers 
pepco energy services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings 
forward contracts that meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting under fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging are accounted for using accrual accounting 
credit and nonperformance risk pepco holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and have established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and there were no investments with non investment grade counterparties

if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s or moody s investor service rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
b exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market mtm energy contract net assets for open unrealized transactions  the net receivable payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to mtm 
amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place 
thus  this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting  but before considering collateral held 
c credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties  not adjusted for probability of default  and  if applicable  property interests including oil and natural gas reserves

delmarva power light company commodity price risk dpl uses derivative instruments forward contracts  futures  swaps  and exchange traded and over the counter options primarily to reduce natural gas commodity price volatility while limiting its customers exposure to increases in the market price of natural gas 
dpl also manages commodity risk with capacity contracts that do not meet the definition of derivatives 
the primary goal of these activities is to reduce the exposure of its regulated retail natural gas customers to natural gas price spikes 
all premiums paid and other transaction costs incurred as part of dpl s natural gas hedging activity  in addition to all gains and losses on the natural gas hedging activity  are fully recoverable through the gas cost rate clause included in dpl s natural gas tariff rates approved by the delaware public service commission and are deferred until recovered
