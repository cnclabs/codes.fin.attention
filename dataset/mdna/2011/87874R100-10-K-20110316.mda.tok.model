the following table reconciles net loss income to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented and is unaudited years ended december  in thousands net loss income interest and other income  net provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation amortization of intangible assets ebitda stock based compensation restructuring charge adjusted ebitda 
table of contents adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management when reviewing the company s performance 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest and other income expense net  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted to exclude stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense  and the impact of non cash stock based compensation expense costs 
because adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda in connection with our compensation of our executive officers and senior management 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

on november   we filed a form k disclosing that we were delaying the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of we further disclosed that we had identified an improper accounting practice relating to certain customer credits that were improperly eliminated as liabilities on our balance sheet 
as a result  our audit committee conducted an investigation into this matter and concluded that there were certain errors in our previously reported financial statements

we assessed the materiality of these errors  both quantitatively and qualitatively  and concluded that the adjustments were not material to the prior annual financial statements or to the interim financial statements for during december  in response to the then current and anticipated future economic uncertainties  we implemented an expense reduction program that included a reduction in workforce  a reduction in a certain office lease  the elimination of our two print publications  and a continuation of strict controls on discretionary spending

application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue  long lived assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of targeted advertising campaigns that we deliver via our network of websites  events and  prior to  print publications 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
although each of our online media offerings can be sold separately  most of our online media sales involve multiple online offerings 
because objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in our bundled advertising campaigns  no allocation can be made to individual line items  and thus we recognize revenue on all services over the term of the arrangement 

table of contents event sponsorships 
we sell our events separately from our other service offerings  and recognize sponsorship revenue from events in the period in which the event occurs 
the majority of our events are free to qualified attendees  however  certain events are based on a paid attendee model 
we recognize revenue for paid attendee events upon completion of the event and receipt of payment from the attendee 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
print 
when sold separately print advertising revenue was recognized at the time the applicable magazine was distributed 
when print advertising campaigns were sold with online media offerings  we recognized revenue for all services in the advertising campaign over the term of the arrangement 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria were recorded as deferred revenue 
online media 
we recognize revenue from our specific online media offerings as follows when these items are sold separately white papers 
we recognize white paper revenue ratably over the period in which the white paper is available on our websites 
webcasts  podcasts and videocasts 
we recognize webcast  podcast and videocast revenue ratably over the period in which the webcast  podcast or videocast is available on our websites 
promotional e mails and e newsletters

we recognize e newsletter revenue in the period in which the e newsletter is sent 
list rentals 
we recognize list rental revenue in the period in which the e mail is sent to the list of registered members 
banners 
we recognize banner revenue in the period in which the banner impressions occur 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
revenue from third party revenue sharing arrangements is recognized on a net basis in the period in which the services are performed 
we offer customers the ability to purchase integrated roi program offerings  which can include any of our online media offerings packaged together to address the particular customer s specific advertising requirements 
as part of these offerings  we will guarantee a minimum number of qualified sales leads to be delivered over the course of the advertising campaign 
we sometimes extend the scheduled end date of advertising campaigns to satisfy lead guarantees or to fulfill all elements of the campaign based on various factors  including delayed receipt of advertising media collateral from the customer 
we estimate the revenue reserve necessary to properly defer revenue recognition for extended advertising campaigns 
these estimates are based on our experience in managing and fulfilling these integrated roi program offerings 
shortfalls in fulfilling lead guarantees before the scheduled completion date of an advertising campaign are satisfied within an average of days of such scheduled completion date 
these integrated roi program offerings represented approximately  and of our online revenues  and  and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets have arisen principally from our acquisitions 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to nine years  using methods of amortization that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates their estimated fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any write offs of accounts receivable significantly different than the amounts reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock based compensation in the statement of operations using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award or using the accelerated method if the award is contingent upon performance goals 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
we calculated the fair values of the options granted using the following estimated weighted average assumptions years ended december  expected volatility expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield weighted average grant date fair value per share as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in may  and there has been limited historical information on the volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of the historical volatility of our stock and reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our stock and the peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture experience of in determining the expense recorded in the years ended december   and 
table of contents internal use software and website development costs we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and related expenses of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software and website applications and infrastructure involving developing software to operate our websites 
however  we expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities since it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our websites and infrastructure 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the states at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
we review capitalized internal use software and website development costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we capitalized internal use software and website development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
as of december   we had state nol carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the nol carryforwards expire through net income loss per share we calculate basic earnings per share eps by dividing earnings available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and vested restricted stock awards outstanding 
because the holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  we do not consider these awards to be participating securities that should be included in our computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and vested restricted stock awards outstanding during the period  plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method 
in calculating diluted eps  the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the average market price for the respective period 
in addition  the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense and assumed tax benefit of stock options that are in the money 
this results in the assumed buyback of additional shares  thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options

table of contents online 
the increase in online revenue was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenue from lead generation offerings  due principally to an increase in white paper and sponsorship sales volumes 
additionally  branding revenue increased by approximately million  due primarily to an increase in banner sales volume 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in third party revenue 
the change in online revenues also includes an increase of million related to a adjustment to correct accounts payable related to customer credit errors 
events 
the decrease in events revenue was primarily attributable to a million decrease in conference revenues and a million decrease in seminar revenues  partially offset by a million increase in our custom events revenues due to the continued efforts of our newly formed custom events group  which has increased our custom events volume 
in  in response to market conditions  we proactively reduced the number of multi day conference events to focus on higher margin  single day and custom events 
this reduction resulted in the decrease in events revenue in cost of revenues and gross profit years ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands cost of revenues online events total cost of revenues gross profit gross profit percentage cost of online revenue

cost of events revenue 
the decrease in cost of events revenue was primarily attributable to a million decrease in conference and seminar series costs due to the decreased number of events and a million decrease in payroll related costs  offset in part by a million increase in custom event costs 
gross profit 
our gross profit is equal to the difference between our revenues and our cost of revenues for the period 
gross margin for was as compared to for the increase in online gross profit was million  primarily attributable to the increase in online revenue as well as a decrease in member acquisition expenses 
online gross profit percentage was in as compared to in this increase was due to the increased revenue resulting in additional leverage when combined with the expense savings from member acquisition costs 
events gross profit was flat  primarily as a result of a higher proportion of our events revenues coming from higher margin custom events in and a reduction in costs due to reduced headcount  offset in part by lower overall events revenues 
events gross profit percentage increased points to in as compared to in this was again a result of reducing the number of multi day events and focusing on our higher margin event offerings 
because the majority of our costs are labor related  we typically expect our gross profit to fluctuate from period to period depending on the total revenues for the period and the relative contribution of online and events revenue to our total revenues

the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in payroll related costs due to an increase in headcount  primarily due to international expansion  a million increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in online revenue  and a million increase in stock based compensation 
the effects of these increases were offset in part by an adjustment that increased sales and marketing expense in by million as a result of a correction of accounts payable related to customer credit errors 
product development 
the decrease in product development expense was primarily due to a reduction in payroll related costs 
additionally  results included an adjustment that increased product development expense by million as a result of a correction of accounts payable related to customer credit errors  which we did not experience in general and administrative 
included in the prior year s results are million of professional fees related to a forensic audit that took place during that year as well as a one time correcting accounting entry that increased expense by million as a result of customer credit errors in accounts payable 
after taking out the effects of these accounting entries and adjustments in  the run rate general and administrative expenses increased by million 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs  including incentive compensation  hiring expenses and use of outside services during the recruitment process of million 
the increased costs were primarily as a result of improved operating results that drive incentive compensation calculations  severance charges recorded  temporary help and the hiring of certain key finance personnel in also contributing were increases of million in facilities related expenses primarily related to the move into a new corporate headquarters on march   a million accrual recorded for potential tax and net worth related liabilities  a million increase in legal fees  primarily related to acquisitions and million in expenses related to international expansion 
these increases were offset in part by a million reduction in stock based compensation  primarily caused by the accelerated vesting in of some performance based equity awards 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to additional depreciation required on our increased fixed asset base as a result of the increased leasehold improvements due to our move to a new corporate headquarters on march  as well as continued investment in internal use software development costs and computer equipment as well as accelerated depreciation related to asset retirements 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during these decreases were partially offset by amortization on newly acquired intangible assets 
interest income  net 
the increase in interest income  net reflects an adjustment to interest income of million in the first quarter of related to interest income recognized in error in the fourth quarter of as well as a decrease in interest expense due to payment of our outstanding debt balance in the fourth quarter of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our subsidiary  techtarget limited  was established in july and is located in london  england 
in august our hong kong subsidiary  techtarget hk limited  was formed in order to facilitate the company s activities in asia pac 
we also have a sales office in india and a vie in beijing  china 
as of december   most of our international customer agreements had been denominated in us dollars  and aggregate foreign currency payments made by us through these entities have not been significant 
we currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future 
interest rate risk at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market accounts  government agency bonds and municipal bonds 
the cash  cash equivalents and investments were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the amount of interest expense we must pay under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the lender s prime rate or libor 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility
