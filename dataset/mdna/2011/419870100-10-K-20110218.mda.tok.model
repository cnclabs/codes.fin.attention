item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hei the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hawaiian electric industries  inc s hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions of the electric utilities and the bank that follow 
hei consolidated executive overview and strategy 
hei is a holding company that operates subsidiaries collectively  the company  principally in hawaii s electric utility and banking sectors 
hei s strategy is to build fundamental earnings and profitability of its operating companies the electric utilities and the bank in a controlled risk manner to support its current dividend and improve operating and capital efficiency in order to build shareholder value 
hei  through its electric utility subsidiary  hawaiian electric company  inc heco  and heco s electric utility subsidiaries  hawaii electric light company  inc helco and maui electric company  limited meco  provides the only electric public utility service to approximately of hawaii s population 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  american savings bank  fsb asb  one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on total assets 
in  net income for hei common stock was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share were per share in  up from per share in due to higher earnings for the bank segment  partly offset by slightly lower earnings at the electric utility segment and higher losses for the other segment and the effects of the higher weighted average number of shares outstanding 
electric utility net income for common stock in of million decreased from the prior year due primarily to lower kilowatthour kwh sales and higher other operation and maintenance o m and depreciation expenses  partly offset by higher rate relief and interest income due to a federal tax settlement 
key to results for will be the impacts of actions taken under the hawaii clean energy initiative hcei and energy agreement  including the steps taken toward the integration of approximately  megawatts mw of new generation from a variety of renewable energy sources into the utility systems and implementing a new regulatory rate making model that decouples revenues from kwh sales 
asb s earnings in of million increased million over prior year net income and included a million net charge for provision for loan losses 
net income for reflected a million after tax charge related to the sale of asb s private issue mortgage related securities portfolio  a million net charge for other than temporary impairment otti of securities and a million net charge for provision for loan losses 
earnings included a million net charge related to asb s balance sheet restructuring  a million net charge for otti of securities and a million net charge for provision for loan losses 
in  management focused on increasing revenues and reducing costs through asb s performance improvement project  which has been completed 
asb s future financial results will continue to be impacted by the interest rate environment  the quality of asb s loan portfolio  and the ongoing results of the performance improvement project 
hei s other segment had a net loss in of million  compared to a net loss of million in hei s consolidated effective tax rate was in compared to in in  hei recognized million in tax expense for the write off of a deferred tax asset due to the expiration of capital loss carryforwards 
shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since the indicated dividend yield as of december  was 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for common stock for  
table of contents and were  and  respectively 
the hei board of directors considers many factors in determining the dividend quarterly  including but not limited to the company s results of operations  the long term prospects for the company  and current and expected future economic conditions 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
see the discussions below of the electric utility and bank segments for their respective executive overviews and strategies 
economic conditions 
note the statistical data in this section is from public third party sources eg  department of business  economic development and tourism  university of hawaii economic research organization uhero  us bureau of labor statistics  blue chip economic indicators  blue chip financial forecasts  hawaii tourism authority  honolulu board of realtors  and national and local newspapers 
the us economy  as measured by gross domestic product gdp  grew in the third quarter of  with the advance estimate of fourth quarter growth at 
according to the february blue chip economic indicators  gdp growth is estimated to be in the first quarter of annual growth was  an improvement over the contraction in the outlook for has improved  with growth now projected at in compared to growth in the december blue chip consensus forecast 
the more positive outlook reflects increased consumer spending and gains in the manufacturing and service sectors  which suggest that the economy may be starting a transition from recovery to expansion 
economic growth has not yet translated into job growth 
the us unemployment rate was in december  down from in november since december  total payroll employment has increased by million  averaging a very low  jobs per month 
although was the best year for job growth since  the growth remains small relative to the million jobs lost since the great recession began 
the february blue chip consensus is for the unemployment rate to average in japan s economic growth was a strong in  but is forecast to decline to in according to the government 
slower growth is expected due to the end of government stimulus measures and a decline in exports 
deflation is also expected to continue in  but consumer prices should fall at a lower rate than in and in  the hawaii economy benefited from economic growth in both the us and japan 
uhero projects that following a contraction in  hawaii s economy real gdp grew by in and will continue to expand by in the visitor industry has provided a much needed boost to hawaii s economy 
in  total visitor arrivals were up over total visitor expenditures rose in due to the increase in visitor arrivals as well as higher average daily visitor spending 
in  uhero projects further growth with arrivals up  with the growth moderated by challenging global economic conditions 
hawaii s construction industry continued to struggle in  but uhero economists believe we are at the cycle s bottom 
for the first eleven months of  the value of total private building permits in the state of hawaii declined by from the same period in permits for new residential construction and additions and alterations declined  but commercial and industrial permit values increased 
statewide  construction jobs were down year to date in november compared to  however  for the last two months there has been year over year growth 
uhero is forecasting that construction jobs will increase by in hawaii s resale housing market in improved based on number of sales  but has struggled in terms of price 
for the year  oahu single family home resales were up compared to  with condominium resales up 
the median sales price for single family homes was up year over year  while the median sales price for condominiums remained flat 
similarly on maui  kauai and the island of hawaii  residential and condominium sales volumes were up by double digit percentages in compared to however  median sale prices were down on all three islands with the exception of residential sales on 
table of contents kauai 
the neighbor island markets have been affected by the downturn more than oahu due to a higher proportion of vacation home development and purchases during the last real estate boom 
in  the hawaii job market had not yet benefited from the positive trends in the visitor industry 
although job losses slowed from the decline experienced in  uhero projects total payroll jobs will end down  followed by an increase of in furloughs for county employees in all four counties were implemented for the fiscal year beginning july  and state employee furloughs  with the exception of teachers  continued 
hawaii s preliminary seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in december was  which remains well below the national unemployment rate of and is seventh lowest in the nation  but is much higher than the rate experienced just two years ago 
there is some reason for optimism  according to uhero economists  gradual progress in the transition to a jobs recovery is confirmed by lower initial unemployment insurance claims in recent months 
real personal income which includes unemployment compensation growth in hawaii in is expected to be according to uhero s estimate  following two consecutive years of decline 
the expectation is for growth of in as the recovery in the visitor industry and resumption of job growth start to have an impact 
the price of a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil averaged in and in the fourth quarter of according to the us energy information administration january short term energy outlook 
the forecast for is an average of per barrel 
interest rates during are expected to remain low  putting downward pressure on yields of loans and investments 
although still at historical lows  long term rates increased during the fourth quarter of  dampening the momentum gained in the housing market during previous quarters 
based on comments from the federal open market committee  the fed will continue to support the current low rate environment until a broader recovery in the labor market and overall economy is realized  as long as core inflation levels remain reasonable 
with the recession over  hawaii showed signs of positive economic activity in  while one of the key indicators  job growth  continued to lag behind 
the outlook for is for continued improvement and for the recovery to spread beyond just the visitor industry 
major tax legislation in congress enacted several bills in dealing with health care reform  job creation and economic stimulus 
two bills enacted in the latter half of the year contained major tax provisions directly affecting the company 
the first was the small business jobs act of  which included the extension of bonus depreciation for all businesses retroactive to january  the second was the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of this legislation included the extension of the lower individual income tax rates on income  dividends and capital gains  the increase in the estate and gift tax exemption amounts  and a reduction in social security tax on employees and self employed individuals 
also  businesses received an extension of bonus depreciation for property placed into service before january  and bonus depreciation for property acquired between september  and january  for the company  the bonus depreciation provisions resulted in an increase in federal tax depreciation of approximately million for  primarily attributable to heco and its subsidiaries 
the company is still evaluating the impact of this additional bonus depreciation for since the transition rules related to the definition of property qualified for bonus depreciation are still unclear 
a number of energy related tax breaks were also extended  including the biodiesel credit through and the grants in lieu of the electricity production credit through the company will continue to analyze these acts for their impacts on results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and for the opportunities they present

retirement benefits 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans  plus earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets  and changes made to the provisions of the plans 
during  changes to the early retirement reduction factors are being phased in with regard to new retirement benefit accruals 
the change is expected to decrease ongoing cost through a reduction in service cost 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of plans that have been frozen in prior years 
no other changes were made to the retirement benefit plans provisions in  and that have had a significant impact on costs 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the company s accounting for retirement benefits is adjusted to account for the impact of decisions by the public utilities commission of the state of hawaii puc 
changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
for  the company s retirement benefit plans assets generated a gain  net of investment management fees  of  resulting in net earnings and unrealized gains of million  compared to net earnings and unrealized gains of million for and net losses and unrealized losses of million for the market value of the retirement benefit plans assets as of december  was million 
see liquidity and capital resources below for the company s cash contributions to the retirement benefit plans 
the company expects that the minimum required contribution to the qualified retirement plans calculated in accordance with the pension protection act of and the expected timing of the cash requirement based on the value of plan assets as of december  will be as set forth below for plan years and the minimum required contribution may differ from the cash funding for each plan year because the rules under the internal revenue code allow the company to make its last installment contribution as late as september of the following year 
in addition  the company is allowed to elect to apply any credit balance against the minimum required contribution 
further  pension tracking mechanisms 
table of contents generally require the electric utilities to fund only the minimum level required under the law until the existing pension assets are reduced to zero  at which time the electric utilities would make contributions to the pension trust in the amount of the actuarially calculated net periodic pension costs  except when limited by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  minimum contribution requirements or the maximum contribution limitation on deductible contributions imposed by the internal revenue code 
as of december   heco s prepaid pension asset was million  helco s was million and meco s had been eliminated

the other business segment includes results of the stand alone corporate operations of hei and american savings holdings  inc ashi  both holding companies  hei investments  inc heiii  a company previously holding investments in leveraged leases but whose wind down was substantially completed during  pacific energy conservation services  inc pecs  a contract services company which provided windfarm operational and maintenance services to an affiliated electric utility until the windfarm was dismantled in the fourth quarter of  hei properties  inc heipi  a company holding passive  venture capital investments venture capital investments valued at million as of december   and the old oahu tug service  inc toots  a maritime freight transportation company that ceased operations in  as well as eliminations of intercompany transactions 
hei corporate level operating  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in each of and in  expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation expense  partly offset by lower retirement benefit expense and an accrual in to dismantle a windfarm in in  expenses decreased slightly from due to not funding the hei charitable foundation and lower consulting fees  partly offset by the accrual to dismantle a windfarm 
the other segment s interest expenses were million in  million in and million in in  financing costs were higher due to the higher level of borrowings and the recognition of the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the forward starting swaps in in  financing costs were lower than in due to lower levels of short term borrowings after hei s common stock sale in december effects of inflation 
us inflation  as measured by the us consumer price index cpi  averaged in  in and in hawaii inflation  as measured by the honolulu cpi  was in and in the department of business  economic development and tourism estimates average honolulu cpi to have been in and forecasts it to be for inflation continues to have an impact on hei s operations 
inflation increases operating costs and the replacement cost of assets 
subsidiaries with significant physical assets  such as the electric utilities  replace assets at much higher costs and must request and obtain rate increases to maintain adequate earnings 
in the past  the puc has granted rate increases in part to cover increases in construction costs and operating expenses due to inflation

legislation 
on march   the affordable care act became law and mandated that employers provide medical coverage to all their employees 
the company provides health insurance benefits to their employees under the provisions of the hawaii prepaid health care act 
thus  the financial impact of the affordable care act is not expected to be significant to the company 
in january  a bill was introduced  which  if implemented as written  would repeal the affordable care act

as of december   the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the company s retirement benefit plans did not exceed the retirement benefit plans benefit obligation 
minimum funding requirements for retirement benefit plans have not been included in the tables above  however  see retirement benefits above for estimated minimum required contributions for and see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments 
the company believes that its ability to generate cash  both internally from electric utility and banking operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and bank borrowings  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its contractual obligations and commercial commitments  its forecasted capital expenditures and investments  its expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company s total assets were billion as of december  and billion as of december  
table of contents the consolidated capital structure of hei excluding deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings was as follows as of the dates indicated december dollars in millions short term borrowings other than bank long term debt  net other than bank preferred stock of subsidiaries common stock equity hei s short term borrowings and hei s line of credit facility were as follows for the period and as of the dates indicated year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings hei commercial paper hei line of credit draws line of credit facility expiring may  undrawn capacity under hei s line of credit facility this table does not include heco s separate commercial paper issuances and line of credit facilities and draws  which are discussed below under electric utility financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at february   hei s outstanding commercial paper balance was million and its line of credit facility was undrawn 
the maximum amount of hei s short term borrowings in was million 
hei utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance commercial paper  to retire long term debt  to pay dividends and for other temporary requirements 
hei also periodically makes short term loans to heco to meet heco s cash requirements  including the funding of loans by heco to helco and meco  but no such short term loans to heco were outstanding as of december  hei periodically utilizes long term debt  historically consisting of medium term notes and other unsecured indebtedness  to fund investments in and loans to its subsidiaries to support their capital improvement or other requirements  to repay long term and short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
effective may   hei entered into a revolving noncollateralized credit agreement establishing a line of credit facility of million  with a letter of credit sub facility  expiring on may   with a syndicate of eight financial institutions 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the agreement contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of hei s issuer rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
the agreement contains customary conditions which must be met in order to draw on it  including compliance with its covenants such as covenants preventing its subsidiaries from entering into agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to  or to repay borrowings from  hei 
in addition to customary defaults  hei s failure to maintain its financial ratios  as defined in its agreement  or meet other requirements may result in an event of default 
for example  under its agreement  it is an event of default if hei fails to maintain a nonconsolidated capitalization ratio funded debt of or less actual ratio of as of december   as calculated under the agreement and consolidated net worth of at least million actual net worth of billion as of december   as calculated under the agreement 

table of contents in addition to their impact on pricing under hei s credit agreement  the rating of hei s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of hei to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of hei securities 
on july   moody s changed hei s rating outlook to stable from negative and affirmed hei s long term and short term commercial paper ratings  indicating that the ratings affirmation and outlook change reflects the progress being made by the company and various stakeholders to transform the regulatory framework for hei s electric utilities to a decoupling structure that will reduce sales volume risk and produce more timely recovery of invested capital and operations and maintenance o m costs 
moody s indicated that the rating could be downgraded if the puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism  or if hei s cash flow to debt declined to below and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times on a sustainable basis 
on november   s p issued an update in which it lowered its long term ratings for hei to bbb from bbb  and indicated the outlook as stable 
in addition  s p affirmed its a short term rating on hei and revised hei s financial profile to aggressive from significant 
s p indicated the rating downgrade reflects an aggressive financial profile combined with weak cash flow generation at hei s electric utilities  delays in implementing new utility rate recovery mechanisms  the growing risks of regulatory disallowances in future rate cases  and a protracted recession 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of hei securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p senior unsecured debt bbb baa the above ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency  from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
management believes that  if hei s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets for commercial paper with hei s ratings or in general were to tighten  it would be difficult and expensive for hei to sell commercial paper or hei might not be able to sell commercial paper in the future 
such limitations could cause hei to draw on its syndicated credit facility instead  and the costs of such borrowings could increase under the terms of the credit agreement as a result of any such ratings downgrades 
similarly  if hei s long term debt ratings were to be downgraded  it would be difficult and more expensive for hei to issue long term debt 
such limitations and or increased costs could materially adversely affect the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of hei and its subsidiaries 
see the electric utilities and bank s respective liquidity and capital resources sections below for the ratings of heco and asb 
in november  hei filed an omnibus registration statement to register an indeterminate amount of debt  equity and hybrid securities 
under securities and exchange commission sec regulations  this registration statement expires on november  on december   hei offered and priced under the registration a public offering of  shares of its common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used in part to repay its outstanding short term indebtedness and to make loans to heco 
issuances of common stock through the hawaiian electric industries  inc dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip  hawaiian electric industries retirement savings plan heirsp and the asb k plan have been important sources of capital for hei 
issuances of common stock through drip  heirsp and the asb k plan which was split off from heirsp in provided new capital of million approximately million shares in and million approximately million shares in from january  through april   issuances of common stock through these plans increased significantly  with hei raising million of new capital through the issuance of approximately 
table of contents million shares for these plans during this period 
hei ceased new issuances of stock through drip and heirsp effective april  and began satisfying the hei common stock requirements of drip and heirsp and the asb k plan upon its inception on may  through open market purchases 
on september   hei resumed satisfying the hei common stock requirements of drip  heirsp and the asb k plan through new issuances of common stock and raised million of new capital through the issuance of approximately million shares to these plans from september to december  operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in investing activities provided used net cash of million in  million in and billion in in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities and heco s consolidated capital expenditures net of contributions in aid of construction  partly offset by repayments of investment and mortgage related securities and a net decrease in loans held for investment 
financing activities used net cash of million in  million in  and billion in in  net cash used in financing activities included net decreases in short term borrowings  other bank borrowings and deposits and the payment of common and preferred stock dividends  partly offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under hei plans 
a portion of the net assets of heco and asb is not available for transfer to hei in the form of dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval 
one of the conditions to the puc s approval of the merger and corporate restructuring of heco and hei requires that heco maintain a consolidated common equity to total capitalization ratio of not less than actual ratio of at december   and restricts heco from making distributions to hei to the extent it would result in that ratio being less than 
in the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or asb  such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of hei  its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
forecasted hei consolidated net cash used in investing activities excluding investing cash flows from asb for through consists primarily of the net capital expenditures of heco and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the funds required for the electric utilities construction programs see electric utility liquidity and capital resources  approximately million will be required during through to repay maturing hei medium term notes  which are expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper  bank borrowings  other medium or long term debt  common stock issued under company plans  and or dividends from subsidiaries 
in addition  million of heco special purpose revenue bonds will be maturing in  which bonds are expected to be repaid with proceeds from issuances of long term debt 
additional debt and or equity financing may be utilized to pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings or may be required to fund unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects of the utilities  unanticipated utility capital expenditures that may be required by the hcei or new environmental laws and regulations  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements and higher tax payments that would result if certain tax positions taken by the company do not prevail or if taxes are increased by federal or state legislation 
in addition  existing debt may be refinanced prior to maturity potentially at more favorable rates with additional debt or equity financing or both 
as further explained in retirement benefits above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company was required to make contributions of million for  but was not required to make any contributions for and to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa  including changes promulgated by the pension protection act of the company made voluntary contributions in  and contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in comprised of million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb  million in and million in and are expected to total million in million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb 
in addition  the company paid directly million of benefits in and 
table of contents million of benefits in each of and and expects to pay million of benefits in depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the company believes it will have adequate cash flow or access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
although the company has off balance sheet arrangements  management has determined that it has no off balance sheet arrangements that either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors  including the following types of off balance sheet arrangements obligations under guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  obligations under derivative instruments  and obligations under a material variable interest held by the company in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
also see forward looking statements above and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition in each of the electric utility and bank segment discussions below 
economic conditions  us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
because the core businesses of hei s subsidiaries are providing local electric public utility services and banking services in hawaii  the company s operating results are significantly influenced by hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism  by the impact of interest rates  particularly on the construction and real estate industries  and by the impact of world conditions eg  afghanistan war on federal government spending in hawaii 
the two largest components of hawaii s economy are tourism and the federal government including the military 
declines in the hawaii  us and asian economies in recent years led to declines in kwh sales  delinquencies in asb s loan portfolio and other adverse effects on hei s businesses 
gdp declined by in  but grew by in if s p or moody s were to further downgrade hei s or heco s debt ratings  or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the company  hei s and heco s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase 
changes in the us capital markets can also have significant effects on the company 
for example  pension funding requirements  as further explained in retirement benefits above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans  and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations 
the electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense  however  a decline in the value of the company s defined benefit pension plan assets may increase the unfunded status of the company s pension plans and result in increases in future funding requirements 
because the earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
hei and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements  the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return and overall economic activity 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including general economic conditions and 
table of contents the policies of government and regulatory authorities 
hei cannot predict future changes in interest rates  nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates and credit spreads also affect the fair value of asb s investment securities 
in  the credit markets experienced significant disruptions  liquidity on many financial instruments declined and residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults increased 
these disruptions negatively impacted the fair value of asb s investment portfolio in however  with the fourth quarter sale of asb s remaining private issue mortgage related securities portfolio and substantial residential loan production in and  the company s exposure to credit and interest rate risks have been reduced 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
heco  helco and meco s transmission and distribution systems excluding substation buildings and contents have a replacement value roughly estimated at billion and are uninsured 
similarly  heco  helco and meco have no business interruption insurance 
if a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur  and if the puc were not to allow the utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption  their results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to an insurance deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur uninsured losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  may require that certain environmental permits be obtained and maintained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities 
obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage related securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  and allowance for loan losses 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies discussed below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the policies affecting both of the company s two principal segments are discussed below and the policies affecting just one segment 
table of contents are discussed in the respective segment s section of material estimates and critical accounting policies 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee and  as applicable  the heco audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and for additional discussion of material estimates and critical accounting policies  see the electric utility and bank segment discussions below under the same heading 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations 
for a discussion of material estimates related to pension and other postretirement benefits collectively  retirement benefits  including costs  major assumptions  plan assets  other factors affecting costs  aoci charges and sensitivity analyses  see retirement benefits in consolidated results of operations above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  including costs of investigation 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the honolulu harbor investigation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from its tax advisors 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
see income taxes in notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
following are discussions of the electric utility and bank segments 
additional segment information is shown in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion concerning hawaiian electric company  inc should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
electric utility executive overview and strategy 
the electric utilities are vertically integrated and regulated by the puc 
the separate island utility systems are not currently interconnected  which requires that additional reliability be built into each system  but also means that the utilities are not exposed to the risks of inter ties 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s growing energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on 
table of contents energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy generation including the use of biofuels and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
heco has completed construction of a new generating unit designed to operate using biodiesel fuel  has completed the first phase and is currently constructing the remaining phase of the east oahu transmission project eotp a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of oahu to load centers on the east side and is working with the state and us department of energy on an undersea cable system to interconnect proposed independent power producer ipp wind farms on the islands of lanai and molokai with the oahu grid 
major infrastructure projects can have a pronounced impact on the communities in which they are located 
the electric utilities continue to expand their community outreach and consultation process so they can better understand  evaluate and address community concerns early in the process 
with large power users in the electric utilities service territories  such as the us military  hotels and state and local government  management believes that retaining customers by offering them specialized services and energy efficiency audits to help them save on energy costs is critical to long term success 
hawaii clean energy initiative 
on october   the governor of the state of hawaii  the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism  the division of consumer advocacy of the state of hawaii department of commerce and consumer affairs  and heco  on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries  helco and meco collectively  the parties  signed an energy agreement setting forth the goals and objectives of the hcei and the related commitments of the parties the energy agreement 
the energy agreement provides that the parties shall pursue a wide range of actions with the purpose of decreasing the state of hawaii s dependence on imported fossil fuels through substantial increases in the use of renewable energy and implementation of new programs intended to secure greater energy efficiency and conservation 
see hawaii clean energy initiative in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
decoupling 
decoupling is a new method of setting electric rates that is designed to support hawaii s efforts to reduce its dependence on imported oil 
in december  the puc allowed heco to implement decoupling  which removes the link between electricity usage and utility revenues 
this aligns the utility with public policy to promote energy efficiency and conservation 
customers will still have an incentive to conserve energy because their bills continue to be based on how much electricity they use 
decoupling also allows the utility to recover on a more timely basis the investments and costs to further support reliability and clean energy 
see decoupling proceeding below 
renewable energy strategy 
the electric utilities have been taking actions intended to protect hawaii s island ecology and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions  while continuing to provide reliable power to customers  and committed to a number of related actions in the energy agreement 
a three pronged strategy supports attainment of the requirements and goals of the state of hawaii renewable portfolio standards rps  the hawaii global warming solutions act of and the hcei by the greening of existing assets  the expansion of renewable energy generation and the acceleration of energy efficiency and load management programs 
major initiatives are being pursued in each category 
in  hawaii s rps law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an rps of   and by december    and  respectively 
for the eleven months ended november   heco s consolidated rps was  including electrical energy savings 
accordingly  the utilities are expected to meet the rps 
this was accomplished through a combination of municipal solid waste  geothermal  wind  biomass  hydro  photovoltaic and biodiesel renewable generation resources  renewable energy displacement technologies  and energy savings from efficiency technologies 
demand side management dsm programs contributed significantly to achieving the rps level and  without including the dsm energy savings  the rps would have been 
energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs will not count toward the rps after in january  the puc opened a docket rps docket to examine hawaii s rps law 
in december  the puc issued a d o approving a stipulated rps framework to govern electric utilities compliance with the rps law 
in the d o  the puc deferred an rps incentive framework to a new generic 
table of contents docket renewable energy infrastructure program reip docket 
in december  the puc approved a potential penalty of for every mwh that an electric utility is deficient under the rps law 
the puc must evaluate the standards every five years  beginning in  to determine whether the standards remain effective and achievable or should be revised 
the electric utilities are actively pursuing the use of biofuels for existing and planned company owned generating units 
heco s new mw generating unit began on going operations in with biodiesel supplied under a two year biodiesel supply contract with renewable energy group marketing logistics  llc reg as approved by the puc in june heco is also moving toward operating some of its steam generating units with a blend of fossil and biofuels co firing 
in june  the puc approved heco s and meco s biofuel supply contracts for their respective biofuel demonstration projects 
heco completed installation of capital equipment in in preparation for a co firing test completed in february at its kahe power plant 
meco plans to test biodiesel at its maalaea power plant in in march  heco and its subsidiaries issued a request for proposal rfp for biofuels produced from feedstock grown in  made in  or otherwise originating in hawaii local biofuel to potentially supply multiple locations 
in january  helco signed a year contract with aina koa pono ka u llc to supply million gallons of biodiesel per year with initial consumption at helco s keahole power plant to begin by heco is continuing negotiations with other bidders 
in january  heco issued a rfp for biodiesel to supply cip ct upon the expiration of the reg contract in july heco expects to issue a rfp in for commercial supplies of biofuel to co fire with fossil fuel at heco s kahe power plant by under current rps law  biofuel use in existing and new generating units counts toward the rps 
the electric utilities also support renewable energy through the negotiation and execution of power purchase agreements ppas with non utility generators using renewable sources eg  refuse fired  geothermal  hydroelectric  photovoltaic and wind turbine generating systems 
on april   heco filed an application with the puc for approval of a photovoltaic pv host pilot program  which would be a two year pilot program whereby heco  helco and meco would lease rooftops or other space from property owners  with a focus on governmental facilities  for the installation of third party owned pv systems 
the pv developer would own  operate and maintain the system and sell the energy to the utilities at a fixed rate under a long term contract 
on august   heco proposed several modifications to the pilot program  including deferment of helco s and meco s participation in the program and utilization of select pv host projects on oahu as test platforms to evaluate grid integration technologies as well as to help address grid integration issues associated with existing and growing penetration levels of distributed intermittent generation 
in  heco issued an oahu renewable energy request for proposals rfp for combined renewable energy projects up to mw 
heco is currently negotiating ppas with the bidders in the award group a proposed wind project mw and a proposed solar project mw 
included in the bids received in response to the rfp were proposals for two large scale neighbor island wind projects that would produce energy to be imported from lanai and molokai to oahu via a yet to be built undersea transmission cable system interisland wind projects 
in accordance with the energy agreement  the proposals for the interisland wind projects were bifurcated from the oahu renewable energy rfp for separate negotiation 
subsequently  heco received a puc waiver from the competitive bidding framework for the two non conforming proposals and negotiations are ongoing 
in september and january  meco executed ppas with kaheawa wind power ii  llc and auwahi wind energy  llc  respectively  for the purchase of mw each of as available wind energy 
the ppa with auwahi wind energy  llc is subject to puc approval 
in january  meco requested that the puc open a docket for meco s plans to acquire up to mw of renewable  firm dispatchable capacity generation resources on maui  with the initial increment coming on line in on september   the puc approved the electric utilities proposed electric vehicle ev charging time of use pilot rates  which are now available to  heco  helco and meco customers for charging highway capable  four wheeled evs 
the ev pilot rates will remain in effect for three years and are designed to encourage early adoption of evs and incentivize customers to charge evs during off peak times of the day 

table of contents the electric utilities promote research and development in the areas supporting renewable energy such as biofuels  ocean energy  energy storage  smart grids and integration of non firm power into the separate island electric grids 
the utilities are evaluating several potential energy storage and smart grid demonstration projects  and conducting various integration studies

also  additional expenses are expected for the costs to operate and maintain cip ct  and are expected to be incurred for environmental compliance in response to existing compliance programs as well as numerous new  more stringent regulatory requirements  and to execute the provisions of the energy agreement 
hcei related initiatives appear to be progressing at a pace to achieve the state s clean energy goals under the hcei 
most recent rate requests 
the electric utilities initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
the puc may grant an interim increase within to months following the filing of an application  but there is no guarantee of such an interim increase and interim amounts collected are refundable  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the puc s final d o 
the timing and amount of any final increase is determined at the discretion of the puc 
the adoption of revenue  expense  rate base and cost of capital amounts including the return on average common equity roace and return on rate base rorb for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the puc to accept any such amounts in its final d o 
roaces of reflects implementation of decoupling  without decoupling and without decoupling were found to be reasonable by the puc in the most recent final rate decisions issued in december  october and july in heco  helco and meco rate cases based on  and test years  respectively 
the roace used by the puc for the purposes of the most recent 
table of contents interim rate increases issued in november and july in helco and meco rate cases  respectively  based on test years was without decoupling 
for  the actual roaces calculated under the rate making method  which excludes the effects of items not included in determining electric utility rates  and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
the utilities actual roaces were lower than their final and interim d o roaces primarily due to lower kwh sales than the sales used to determine the interim rates and increased o m expenses 
the rorbs found to be reasonable by the puc in the most recent final rate decisions were for heco  for helco and for meco final d os noted above 
the rorbs used by the puc for purposes of the most recent interim increases were for helco and for meco interim d os noted above 
for  the actual rorbs calculated under the rate making method  which excludes the effects of items not included in determining electric utility rates  and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
in the most recent interim and final rate decisions  the puc allowed the use by each utility of pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb tracking mechanisms with varied treatment of the pension assets of each utility and allowed the continuation of each utility s energy cost adjustment clauses ecac 
heco 
test year rate case 
on december   heco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect  based on a test year  an roace and an rorb on a billion average rate base 
heco s application included a proposed new tiered rate structure for residential customers to reward customers who practice energy conservation with lower electric rates for lower monthly usage 
on september   heco  the consumer advocate and the federal department of defense dod collectively  the parties executed and filed an agreement on most of the issues in this rate case  and on october   the puc issued  and heco implemented  an interim d o granting heco an increase of million in annual revenues over rates effective at the time of the interim d o  subject to refund with interest 
the interim increase was based on the settlement agreement which included  as a negotiated compromise of the parties respective positions  an roace of  an rorb  a billion average rate base and a capital structure which includes a common equity capitalization 
in may  the interim increase was adjusted from million to million in annual revenues to take into account the changes in current effective rates as a result of the final d o in the test year rate case 
in september  the interim increase was corrected to million based on a filing submitted by heco 
on september   the puc issued a final d o that confirmed the interim increase of million and approved the stipulated rate design  which includes the new tiered rate structure for residential customers 
decoupling was not addressed in this proceeding and the final d o did not address the implementation of decoupling 
test year rate case 
in july  heco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect  based on a test year  an roace and an rorb on a billion average rate base 
the requested rate increase was based on higher o m costs required for heco s electrical system  higher depreciation expenses since the last rate case and anticipated plant additions estimated at the time of filing of million in and including the new cip ct and related transmission line in to maintain and improve system reliability 
in may  heco  the consumer advocate and the dod the parties executed an agreement the settlement agreement on most of the issues in the rate case  representing a negotiated compromise of the parties respective positions 
the settlement agreement included an interim increase of million annually  or a increase over the rates then in effect 
as part of the settlement  the parties also agreed that the puc should allow heco to establish a revenue balancing account  which would provide a 
table of contents mechanism to adjust revenues increases decreases for the differences shortages overages between the actual revenues and the revenues determined in the interim d o 
in july  the puc issued an interim d o  which approved an interim rate increase  but directed that adjustments be made to reduce the settlement agreement increase for several items  including certain labor expenses and costs related to cip ct heco calculated an interim increase of million annually  or a increase  based on an roace of and an rorb on a rate base of billion 
the interim increase was implemented on august  in february  the puc issued a second interim d o in this proceeding granting an additional increase of million in annual revenues implemented effective february  to recover costs associated with cip ct and related transmission facilities 
the increase was based on an roace of and an rorb of  both of which were used for the first interim increase 
the two interim increases granted totaled million  or a increase 
on december   the puc issued a final d o  which allowed heco to implement the decoupling mechanism approved by the puc in the decoupling proceeding described below 
the puc determined that  in view of implementing decoupling  the appropriate roace is and rorb is which reflects a capital structure that includes common equity 
the puc also approved a purchased power adjustment clause ppac that will allow heco to recover purchase power expenses through a surcharge mechanism rather than through base rates as currently recovered 
the ppac provides a mechanism that more closely aligns cost recovery with costs incurred  thus reducing heco s risk profile associated with its ppas 
the ppac is expected to enhance heco s credit quality  help heco maintain access to capital markets at reasonable costs and help position heco to invest in infrastructure to both facilitate the addition of new renewable resources from ipps and to maintain reliable electrical service 
based on the final d o  heco will be refunding million to customers including interest during february in december  heco recorded charges of million related to this refund  which reduced net income by approximately million 
on january   heco filed tariffs for the final rates for the puc s review and approval and requested the tariffs become effective on march  the tariffs included provisions to establish the decoupling revenue balancing account which removes the historic link between electricity usage and revenues  the revenue adjustment mechanism which allows the utility to recover its investments and costs in a timelier manner and the ppac 
the tariffs also included a tiered rate structure 
the final revenue requirements incorporate a roace of  resulting in an annualized revenue increase of million  or  compared to the annualized interim increase of million a decrease in annual revenues of million 
management cannot predict when the tariffs implementing the final rate increase will be approved and become effective 
test year rate case 
on july   heco filed a request with the puc for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect which included the interim increases in the heco and rate cases  based on a test year  the estimated impacts of the implementation of decoupling and depreciation rates and methods as proposed by heco 
excluding the effects of the implementation of decoupling  the effective revenue request is million  or a increase 
the request includes an increase of million  or or million  or without the implementation of decoupling  primarily to pay for major capital projects including investments in the mw biofuel generating facility that were not part of the test year rate case and phase of the east oahu transmission project  which was placed in service on june  and higher operating and maintenance costs to maintain service reliability 
the remainder of the request is to recover the costs for several proposed programs to help reduce hawaii s dependence on imported oil  further increase reliability and increase fuel security 
the request is based on a roace  an rorb  a billion average rate base and a capital structure which includes a common equity capitalization 
management cannot predict the timing  or the ultimate outcome  of an interim or final d o in this rate case 

table of contents helco 
test year rate case 
in may  helco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect  based on a test year  an rorb  an roace and a million average rate base 
helco s request included a proposed new tiered rate structure to reward residential customers who practice energy conservation with lower electric rates for lower monthly usage 
the proposed rate increase was requested to pay for improvements made to increase reliability  including transmission and distribution line improvements and the two generating units at the keahole power plant ct and ct  and increased o m expenses 
in march  helco and the consumer advocate reached settlement agreements on all revenue requirement issues in the rate case proceeding 
helco agreed to write off a portion of ct and ct costs  which resulted in an after tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of on april   the puc issued an interim d o granting helco an increase of  or million in annual revenues  over revenues at present rates 
the interim increase reflected the settlement of the revenue requirement issues reached between helco and the consumer advocate and was based on an average rate base of million which reflects the write off of a portion of ct and ct costs and an rorb of incorporating an roace of 
on october   the puc issued a final d o that confirmed the interim increase of million and approved the stipulated rate design  which includes the new tiered rate structure 
decoupling was not addressed in this proceeding nor the final d o 
in november  helco filed its revised tariff sheets and rate schedules  which the puc approved on january  and became effective on january  on december   keahole defense coalition kdc filed a notice of appeal of the final d o with the intermediate court of appeals 
kdc had been granted participant status in the rate case  limited to issues pertinent to helco s expansion of the keahole generating station  and proposed a number of disallowances of costs associated with ct and ct  but did not propose a total amount of disallowances 
the appeal is pending  and management cannot predict the timing  or the ultimate outcome  of this appeal 
however  the pendency of the appeal has not affected implementation of the rate increase approved in the final d o 
test year rate case 
on december   helco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect  based on a test year  a roace and an rorb on a million average rate base 
the proposed rate increase would cover investments for system upgrade projects  including an mw heat recovery steam generator st and two major transmission line upgrades  as well as increasing o m expenses 
helco s proposed rorb and roace assume the establishment of a revenue balancing account and a revenue adjustment mechanism  based on the joint decoupling proposal see decoupling proceeding below  the implementation of the reip ceis  which the puc has approved in a separate proceeding  and a purchased power adjustment clause to recover non energy ppa costs proposed in the proceeding 
if the cost recovery mechanisms are not approved  the test year revenue requirements would be million  based on an rorb and an roace 
helco s filing also proposed adoption of inverted tiered rates and an optional residential time of use service rate to enable customers to manage their energy usage 
helco and the consumer advocate executed and filed a settlement agreement on all material issues in this rate case proceeding on september   and filed a joint statement of probable entitlement jspe on october   both of which are subject to approval by the puc 
if the settlement were to be approved by the puc  the net interim increase in annual revenues would amount to million  or a increase 
as part of the settlement agreement  helco would reset the heat rate used in its ecac calculation when the interim rates become effective  which would shift million of revenues that would have been included in the ecac revenues to the interim increase and result in a total interim increase of million 
the agreement included a roace  an rorb  a million average rate base and a capital structure which includes of common equity 
in the settlement agreement  the parties agreed to accept the 
table of contents roace authorized in the final d o for heco s test year rate case  reflecting decoupling as the final roace in this rate case 
the difference between the amounts requested in the initial application and the million net increase under the settlement relates primarily to changes in expenses since the rate case was filed and changes in the roace and rorb 
on november   the puc issued an interim d o granting an interim rate increase as set forth in the jspe  but adjusting recovery for labor costs downward to levels  reducing medical  dental and vision benefit costs by approximately  deferring the implementation of decoupling for helco until the final d o  and deferring resetting of the heat rate used in helco s ecac calculation 
since the interim d o deferred implementation of decoupling  the puc found that a roace and an rorb which reflects a capital structure that includes common equity  was reasonable for purposes of the interim d o 
on january   the puc approved helco s revised revenue requirements resulting in an interim increase of approximately million in annual revenues 
the difference between the million increase in the jspe and the million increase as a result of the interim d o relates primarily to an adjustment of million to the jspe interim increase amount to take into account the changes in current effective rates as a result of the final rates from the helco test year rate case issued subsequent to the jspe 
the helco test year interim d o adjustments to the jspe for lower expenses were largely offset by the higher allowed roace 
the interim increase reflects the new depreciation rates and methods proposed by helco and approved by the puc on a temporary basis which will result in a million annualized decrease in depreciation expense effective with interim rates 
helco implemented the interim rate increase and the final rates as a result of the test year rate case on january  management cannot predict the ultimate outcome or timing of a final d o in this rate case 
meco 
test year rate case 
in february  meco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  based on a test year 
in september  meco proposed an updated lower increase in annual revenues of million  or over the electric rates then in effect based on an roace and an rorb on a million rate base 
meco s request included a proposed new tiered rate structure to reward residential customers who practice energy conservation with lower electric rates for lower monthly usage 
the proposed rate increase would pay for improvements to increase reliability  including two new generating units  and transmission and distribution infrastructure improvements 
in december  meco and the consumer advocate reached a settlement of all the revenue requirement issues in this rate case  and the puc issued an interim d o based on the settlement agreement granting meco an increase of million in annual revenues  or  based on a roace and an rorb on a million rate base 
on july   the puc issued a final d o in the rate case confirming the december interim d o rate increase 
test year rate case 
on september   meco filed a request for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates then in effect  based on a test year  a roace and an rorb on a million rate base 
the proposed rate increase was requested to cover investments to improve service reliability  including the replacement and upgrade of power plant control systems  installation of a new kw photovoltaic system  replacement and upgrade of underground lines  new or expanded substations to support growth and improve service  and higher o m expenses due to meco s aging infrastructure 
meco s proposed rorb and roace assumed the establishment of a revenue balancing account and a revenue adjustment mechanism  based on the joint decoupling proposal 
if the joint decoupling proposal is not approved  the test year revenue requirements would be recalculated using an roace and an rorb 
on june   meco and the consumer advocate executed and filed a settlement agreement on all material issues in this rate case proceeding  which agreement is subject to approval by the puc 
on july   the puc issued an interim d o granting meco an increase of million in annual revenues  or over revenues currently in effect implemented effective on august  
the interim increase was 
table of contents based on the settlement agreement  which included a roace  an rorb  a million average rate base and a capital structure which includes of common equity 
the interim increase also reflected the new depreciation rates and methods proposed by meco and approved by the puc on a temporary basis in a separate depreciation proceeding  but did not reflect the implementation of decoupling 
in the settlement agreement  the parties agreed to accept the roace authorized in the final d o for heco s test year rate case  reflecting decoupling as the final roace in this rate case 
under the settlement agreement  meco agreed to limit to million the amount to be included in rate base for the investment in plant for a combined heat and power chp system installed at a hotel site in september  resulting in a charge to expense of approximately million in the second quarter of on november   meco and the consumer advocate filed a joint motion to adjust the interim increase  based on the final rates approved in the meco test year rate case on july  on january   the puc approved meco s request to adjust the test year interim increase to million  or over revenues based on the rates approved in the meco test year rate case 
the downward adjustment resulted from a shift in recovery from the interim surcharges to the final base rates  with no net impact on total rates 
on january   the adjusted interim rates test year and the final rates test year became effective 
management cannot predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of a final d o in this rate case 
decoupling proceeding 
in the energy agreement  the parties agreed to seek approval from the puc to implement  beginning with the heco test year rate case interim d o  a decoupling mechanism  similar to that in place for several california utilities  which decouples revenues from kwh sales and provides for revenue adjustments between rate cases 
overall  general rate cases for each utility would be expected to be less frequent than in the utilities recent history 
the decoupling mechanism would be subject to review at any time by the puc or upon request of any utility or the consumer advocate 
in october  the puc opened an investigative proceeding to examine implementing a decoupling mechanism for the utilities 
in may  the utilities and the consumer advocate filed their joint proposal joint decoupling proposal for a decoupling mechanism with three components a sales decoupling component via a revenue balancing account rba  a revenue escalation component via a revenue adjustment mechanism ram and an earnings sharing mechanism 
the rba mechanism provides for revenue adjustments increases or decreases between rate cases to account for the difference between the revenues allowed in the most recent rate case target revenues and the revenues actually received by the utility 
the ram provides for changes in revenue requirements between rate cases for changes in o m expenses and to allow for the return on and return of plant additions between rate cases excluding plant additions for projects recovered through the reip surcharge 
the ram provides more timely recovery of invested capital and o m costs because the utilities revenue requirements will reflect some portion of the increased costs without the need for a rate proceeding 
the earnings sharing mechanism would provide for a reduction of rates between rate cases in the event the utility exceeds the roace allowed in its most recent rate case 
on august   the puc issued a final d o  which approved the decoupling mechanism proposed in the joint decoupling proposal  subject to certain modifications 
those modifications excluded merit wage increases and cost overruns for major capital projects capital projects greater than or equal to million from the ram with recovery of such increases and overruns to be considered in the utility s next rate case  required additional information related to capital projects less than million  and required the utilities and the consumer advocate to jointly file an outreach plan 
implementation of the decoupling mechanism is to occur when rates that reflect a reduced rate of return due to decoupling are approved by the puc in either an interim or final d o in the utilities pending rate cases 
in the final d o in heco s test year rate case issued on december   the puc approved a reduced roace due to decoupling and allowed heco to implement the approved decoupling mechanism and to immediately begin tracking target revenue and recorded adjusted revenue 
in january  heco filed tariffs for final rates for the puc s review and approval and requested that the tariffs become effective on march  upon approval and implementation of the final rates  heco will implement the approved decoupling mechanism 
authorizations for the implementation of decoupling for helco and meco are pending final d os or other action by the puc in their pending rate 
table of contents cases 
per the decoupling d o  the utilities will file staggered rate cases every three years  the first being heco s test year filed in july other regulatory matters

demand side management programs 
energy efficiency demand side management programs 
in february  the puc required that the administration of all energy efficiency ee dsm programs be turned over to a non utility  third party administrator 
the puc executed a public benefits fund pbf administrator contract with science applications international corporation saic and on july   saic began administering the ee dsm programs 
a pbf surcharge on electric utility revenues in  in and and thereafter is being used to fund ee dsm programs  incentives  program administration  and other related program costs 
the puc continues to permit recovery of reasonably incurred dsm implementation costs within approved budgets  under the integrated resource plan framework 
through  the puc also provided for dsm utility incentives derived from a graduated performance based schedule of net system benefits 
in order to qualify for an incentive  the utility must have met cumulative mw and mwh reduction goals for its ee dsm programs in the commercial  industrial and residential sectors 
the amount of the annual incentive has been subject to caps determined separately for each utility 
the dsm utility incentive mechanism ended once the energy efficiency programs were transferred to the pbf administrator in july heco and meco earned their maximum dsm utility incentives of million and million  respectively  in in a december  order  the puc denied heco s request to increase its energy efficiency program budgets and the utilities request to reallocate a portion of the unspent funding between dsm programs to cover actual expenditures in because the utilities were not able reallocate the unspent funding between programs and thus recover the entire amount of dsm program expenditures  the utilities recorded an expense of million in december in addition  the puc advised that the utilities cannot include any of the energy savings from the program applications that exceeded their budgets in the calculations of dsm utility incentives 
based on the order  heco calculated revised dsm incentives of million and has submitted them for puc review and approval 
load management dsm programs 
unlike the ee dsm programs  load management dsm programs continue to be administered by the utilities 
heco s residential load management program includes a monthly electric bill credit for eligible customers who participate in the program  which allows heco to disconnect the customer s residential electric water heaters or central air conditioning systems from heco s system to reduce system load when deemed necessary by heco 
the commercial and industrial load management program provides an incentive on the portion of the demand load that eligible customers allow to be controlled or interrupted by heco 
this program includes a small business direct load control element 
in december  the puc approved heco s requests to extend the commercial and industrial direct load control cidlc program and the residential direct load control rdlc program through the cidlc program application included an action plan for a load aggregator pilot program 
in october  heco filed an rdlc program increase request to accommodate anticipated base expenses for the cost of a program impact evaluation needed to update the cost effectiveness calculations identified by the puc 
in november  heco filed its cidlc and rdlc program budgets approval request 
the puc suspended both requests in order to gather additional information to further evaluate the requests 
in august  heco filed an application for a fast demand response pilot fast dr program a two year pilot program designed to test commercial and industrial market acceptance of load reductions within minutes of event notification  and demonstrate the technical aspects of semi automatic and automatic mechanisms to initiate customer reductions in load 
the procedural steps in the docket will be completed in february  after which the puc can make a decision 
renewable energy infrastructure program 
the renewable energy infrastructure program reip proposed by heco in december consisted of two components renewable energy infrastructure 
table of contents projects that facilitate third party development of renewable energy resources  maintain existing renewable energy resources and or enhance energy choices for customers  and the creation and implementation of a temporary renewable energy infrastructure surcharge to recover the capital costs  deferred costs for software development and licenses  and or other relevant costs approved by the puc 
these costs would be removed from the surcharge and included in base rates in the utility s next rate case 
in december  the puc issued a d o approving heco s proposed reip  including the reip surcharge  subject to certain conditions specified in the d o 
the puc may review the benefits and continued need for the reip every three years or earlier if necessary 
the puc approved the use of the reip surcharge to recover certain interconnection costs for a wind project 
in july  the utilities submitted as directed by the puc proposed standards and guidelines for utility funding of renewable infrastructure projects associated with independent power producers 
delinking energy payment rates from oil costs 
on april   the puc initiated a docket to examine the methodology for calculating schedule q electricity payment rates in the state of hawaii 
in general  schedule q rates are available to customers with cogeneration and or small power production facilities with a capacity of kw or less who buy power from or sell power to the electric utility 
the proceeding was intended to examine new methodologies for calculating schedule q payment rates  with the intent of removing or reducing any linkages between the price of fossil fuels and the rate for non fossil fuel generated electricity 
the parties to the energy agreement agreed that all new renewable energy contracts are to be delinked from fossil fuel and that the utilities would seek to renegotiate existing ppas with ipps that are based on fossil fuel prices to delink their energy payment rates from oil costs 
in december  heco  helco and meco filed updated avoided energy costs rates and schedule q rates to be effective for  subject to monthly adjustment of the fuel component of the rates for changes in fuel prices 
a stipulated procedural schedule for the schedule q proceeding  which calls for the filing of final statements of position in april  was approved by the puc in january clean energy scenario planning  integrated resource planning and requirements for additional generating capacity 
the puc issued an order in requiring the energy utilities in hawaii to develop integrated resource plans irps  which would then be approved  rejected or modified by the puc 
the goal of integrated resource planning is the identification of demand and supply side resources and the integration of these resources for meeting near and long term consumer energy needs in an efficient and reliable manner at the lowest reasonable cost 
under the puc s irp framework  the utilities were entitled to recover all appropriate and reasonable integrated resource planning costs either through a surcharge or through their base rates 
under procedural schedules for the irp cost proceedings  the utilities were able to recover their incremental irp costs in the month following the filing of their actual costs incurred for the year  subject to refund with interest pending the puc s final d o approving recovery in the docket for each year s costs 
helco since february  heco since september and meco since december recover irp costs through base rates 
previously  heco  helco and meco recovered their costs through a surcharge 
the consumer advocate had objected to recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental irp costs incurred by the utilities during in january  the puc issued a d o that allowed the utilities to recover their irp planning costs  but disallowed certain costs  primarily costs incurred during a rate case test year 
the utilities will be refunding to customers approximately million representing disallowed costs previously recovered through a surcharge and interest to its customers in february the utilities had been reserving for a potential refund for portions of the cost previously recovered and related interest  based on final d os related to irp planning costs 
in december  the utilities recorded additional charges of million to fully accrue for this refund 
the parties to the energy agreement agreed to seek to replace the irp process with a new clean energy scenario planning cesp process intended to be used to determine future investments in generation and transmission that will be necessary to facilitate high levels of renewable energy production and reductions in electricity use through energy efficiency programs 
in the fourth quarter of  the puc closed the irp 
table of contents processes and directed the utilities to suspend all activities pursuant to the irp framework to allow for resources to be diverted to the development of the cesp framework 
heco and the consumer advocate filed a proposed cesp framework with the puc in april in may  the puc opened an investigative proceeding to examine the proposed framework 
as consensus between all parties and participants in the proceeding could not be reached  four revised proposed frameworks were separately filed by various parties and participants in august for the puc s consideration 
the cesp framework filed jointly by heco and its subsidiaries  the consumer advocate  kauai island utility cooperative and the county of kauai proposes a planning process resulting in a year action plan developed from multiple scenarios and associated year resource plans for each scenario 
the proposed focus on scenario planning and shorter term action plans rather than year plans recognizes that planning assumptions are uncertain and that the planning framework should facilitate making adjustments to resource plans as circumstances change 
puc adoption of a cesp framework is pending 
adequacy of supply 
heco 
in february  heco filed its adequacy of supply aos letter  which indicated that based on its may sales and peak forecast  heco s generation capacity for to is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
heco anticipates that it will acquire mw from a distributed standby generation facility to be located at the honolulu international airport and mw from an expansion of the existing h power waste to energy facility located at campbell industrial park within the next two years 
beginning in  heco anticipates that based on increasing demand it will begin experiencing reserve capacity shortfalls if no more firm generating capacity is added to the system 
also  four existing generating units may be retired within the next years 
waiau units and are being considered for retirement because of their age 
honolulu units and may need to be retired because of more stringent environmental regulations 
heco estimates it will need approximately mw of new  firm generating capacity to replace the capacity that would be lost with the retirement of these four units and to accommodate load growth 
heco plans to solicit proposals in for firm renewable generating capacity 
helco 
in january  helco filed its aos letter  which indicated that helco s generation capacity through is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
helco is currently negotiating with two ipps to supply additional firm renewable generating capacity to the helco grid 
should these additional firm renewable facilities come on line within the next three years as anticipated  helco will not have a need for additional firm capacity in the foreseeable future 
helco  however  may choose to add additional renewable generating capacity to replace existing nonrenewable generation 
meco 
in january  meco filed its aos letter  which indicated that meco s generation capacity through is sufficient to meet the forecasted demands on the islands of maui  lanai and molokai  but also stated that additional increments of firm capacity will be needed on maui in and should a major ipp cease providing capacity and energy to meco after december  also  in january  meco filed a request to open a new docket related to meco s plan to proceed with a competitive bidding process to acquire up to approximately mw of new  renewable firm dispatchable capacity generation resources on the island of maui  with the initial increment expected to come on line in the timeframe 
december outage 
on december   an island wide outage occurred on the island of oahu during a severe lightning storm that resulted in a loss of electric service to heco customers ranging from approximately to hours 
on january   the puc initiated an investigation of the outage 
in march  heco submitted an outage report prepared by its expert consultant  which concluded that the island wide outage was triggered by lightning strikes and found that the heco system was in proper operating condition and was appropriately staffed at the time of the lightning storm  and heco s restoration efforts were prudent and allowed for restoration of power as quickly as possible under the circumstances 

table of contents in january  the consumer advocate submitted its statement of position that heco could not have anticipated or prevented the outage through reasonable measures and could not have reasonably shortened the outage and restored power more quickly to customers 
the consumer advocate further stated that penalties should not be assessed for the outage  but recommended that numerous studies be performed with the objective of preventing or minimizing the scope and duration of future power outages 
management cannot at this time predict the outcome of the puc s investigation of the outage or its impact on heco 
intra governmental wheeling of electricity 
in june  the puc initiated a docket to examine the feasibility of implementing intra governmental wheeling of electricity in the state of hawaii 
the puc subsequently suspended this docket  but reinstated it in november in january  the puc adopted the procedural schedule proposed by the parties and participants  which includes a panel hearing around the fourth quarter of collective bargaining agreements 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislation and regulation 
congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
also see hawaii clean energy initiative and environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and major tax legislation in above 
increase in oil tax 
on july   the state tax on petroleum products shipped to hawaii increased from to per barrel 
the higher tax  which is passed on to consumers  increased the price of gasoline and electricity and is expected to generate funds to reduce the state s budget deficit and support local food production and renewable energy programs 
renewable energy 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that stated that the puc may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters 
due to this measure  it is possible that  if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel  the puc may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source 
in  a hawaii law was enacted to promote and encourage the use of solar thermal energy 
this measure requires the installation of solar thermal water heaters in residences constructed after january   but allows for limited variances in cases where installation of solar water heating is deemed inappropriate 
the measure establishes standards for quality and performance of such systems 
also in  a hawaii law was enacted that is intended to facilitate the permitting of larger mw or greater renewable energy projects 
the energy agreement includes several undertakings by the utilities to integrate solar energy into the electric grid 
in  a bill became hawaii law act that authorizes preferential rates to agricultural energy producers selling electricity to utilities 
this will help support the long term development of locally grown biofuel crops  cultivating potential local renewable fuel sources for the utilities 
in addition  pursuant to act also adopted in  avoided cost is no longer a consideration in determining a just and reasonable rate for non fossil fuel generated electricity 
this will allow the utilities to negotiate purchased power prices for renewable energy that have the potential to be more stable and less costly than current pricing tied to avoided cost 
biofuels 
in  a hawaii law was enacted with the stated purpose of encouraging further production and use of biofuels in hawaii 
it established that biofuel processing facilities in hawaii are a permitted use in designated agricultural districts and established a program with the hawaii department of agriculture to encourage the production in hawaii of energy feedstock ie  raw materials for biofuels 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that encourages the development of biofuels by authorizing the hawaii board of land and natural resources to lease public lands to growers or producers of plant and animal material used for the production of biofuels 
the utilities have agreed in the energy agreement to test the use of biofuels in their generating units and  if economically feasible  to connect them to the use of biofuels 
for its part  the state agrees to support 
table of contents this testing and conversion by expediting all necessary approvals and permitting 
the energy agreement recognizes that  if such conversion is possible  heco s requirements for biofuels would encourage the development of a local biofuels industry 
heco and meco have received puc approval to enter into and recover the costs of biodiesel fuel contracts under which they are purchasing biofuels to operate heco s cip ct and to test their use in other heco and meco generating units 
helco has entered into a year contract  subject to puc approval  to purchase million gallons of biodiesel per year beginning in for additional discussion of environmental legislation and regulations  see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact of the foregoing legislation or legislation that is  or may in the future be  proposed 
other developments 
advanced metering infrastructure 
in december  the utilities filed an advanced metering infrastructure ami project application with the puc for approval of implementation of an ami project  covering approximately  meters on oahu  on the island of hawaii and on maui  and a contract between sensus metering systems  inc sensus and heco under which the utilities would purchase smart meters and pay sensus to provide and maintain a radio frequency communication system to operate the smart meters and related equipment 
heco submitted a proposal to the puc in may  describing an extended pilot test of the ami system and smart meters involving  new sensus ami meters 
heco s proposal also contained an update on developments in the smart grid  customer information system cis and cyber security areas 
on july   the puc issued an order denying the utilities request to defer certain costs for an extended pilot test of their ami system and smart meters on oahu  and dismissing the utilities ami application  but without prejudice to the filing of a new application 
in its order  the puc reiterated its support for an ami and smart grid concept to reduce the state s dependence on fossil fuels  but noted that future ami and smart grid applications should include or be preceded by an overall smart grid plan or proposal filed with the puc 
as of december   the utilities did not have any deferred costs related to the ami project proceeding 
the utilities  like the puc and consumer advocate  continue to support a broad range of smart grid initiatives  including ami  as important components of a clean energy strategy and are assessing  testing and deploying various smart grid technologies on its systems 
heco is actively working with sensus on further testing of its ami and broader smart grid capabilities 
the cost of this testing will be expensed 
heco and sensus have agreed that their respective rights to terminate their contract based on the lack of puc application approval shall extend until march  commitments and contingencies

liquidity and capital resources 
management believes that heco s ability  and that of its subsidiaries  to generate cash  both internally from operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and lines of credit  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund their respective capital expenditures and investments and to cover debt  retirement benefits and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
heco s consolidated capital structure was as follows as of the dates indicated december dollars in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net preferred stock common stock equity 
table of contents heco s short term borrowings other than from helco and meco  heco s line of credit facility and the principal amount of special purpose revenue bonds that have been authorized by the hawaii legislature for future issuance by the dbf for the benefit of the utilities were as follows for the period and as of the dates indicated year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings commercial paper line of credit draws borrowings from hei line of credit facilities undrawn capacity under line of credit facility expiring may  n a special purpose revenue bonds authorized for issue legislative authorization expired june  helco legislative authorization expiring june  heco helco meco total special purpose revenue bonds available for issue the maximum amount of external short term borrowings in was million 
at december   heco had million and million of short term borrowings from helco and meco  respectively  which borrowings are eliminated in consolidation 
at february   heco had no outstanding commercial paper  its line of credit facility was undrawn  it had no borrowings from hei and it had borrowings of million and million from helco and meco  respectively 
heco utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance short term debt and for other temporary requirements 
heco also borrows short term from hei for itself and on behalf of helco and meco  and heco may borrow from or loan to helco and meco short term 
the intercompany borrowings among the utilities  but not the borrowings from hei  are eliminated in the consolidation of heco s financial statements 
heco and its subsidiaries periodically utilize long term debt  historically borrowings of the proceeds of special purpose revenue bonds issued by the state of hawaii department of budget and finance dbf  to finance the utilities capital improvement projects  or to repay short term borrowings used to finance such projects 
the puc must approve issuances  if any  of equity and long term debt securities by heco  helco and meco 
due to market conditions since september which resulted in a tightening of the commercial paper market  higher commercial paper rates and limitations on maturity options and as a result of an s p downgrade of heco s short term borrowing rating to a from a  heco drew on its previous million syndicated line of credit facility in june and july  rather than issue commercial paper 
all such draws borrowings were repaid in august heco re entered the commercial paper market in march  experiencing higher rates and shorter terms 
effective may   heco entered into a revolving noncollateralized credit agreement establishing a line of credit facility of million  with a letter of credit sub facility  with a syndicate of eight financial institutions 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of heco s issuer rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p and moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
the agreement contains customary conditions that must be met in order to draw on it  including compliance with several covenants such as covenants preventing its subsidiaries from entering into agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to  or to repay borrowings from  heco  and restricting its ability as well as the ability of any of 
table of contents its subsidiaries to guarantee additional indebtedness of the subsidiaries if such additional debt would cause the subsidiary s consolidated subsidiary funded debt to capitalization ratio to exceed actual ratio of for helco and for meco as of december   as calculated under the agreement 
in addition to customary defaults  heco s failure to maintain its financial ratios  as defined in its agreement  or meet other requirements may result in an event of default 
for example  under its agreement  it is an event of default if heco fails to maintain a consolidated capitalization ratio equity of at least actual ratio of as of december   as calculated under the agreement 
in addition to their impact on pricing under heco s credit agreement  the ratings of heco s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of heco to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures eg  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of heco securities 
on july   moody s changed heco s rating outlook to stable from negative and affirmed heco s long term and short term commercial paper ratings  indicating that the ratings affirmation and outlook change reflected the progress being made to transform the regulatory framework for the utilities to a decoupling structure that will reduce sales volume risk and produce more timely recovery of invested capital and o m costs 
moody s indicated the rating could be downgraded if the hawaii puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism or if the utilities cash flow to debt declined to below on a sustainable basis and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times 
on november   s p issued an update in which it lowered its long term ratings for heco  helco and meco to bbb from bbb  and indicated the outlook as stable 
in addition  s p affirmed its a short term rating on heco and revised heco s financial profile to aggressive from significant 
s p indicated the rating downgrade reflects an aggressive financial profile combined with weak cash flow generation at hei s electric utilities  delays in implementing new utility rate recovery mechanisms  the growing risks of regulatory disallowances in future rate cases  and a protracted recession 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of heco securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p special purpose revenue bonds insured principal amount noted in parentheses  senior unsecured  insured as follows ambac assurance corporation billion bbb baa financial guaranty insurance company billion bbb baa mbia insurance corporation billion bbb baa syncora guarantee inc formerly xl capital assurance inc 
billion bbb baa special purpose revenue bonds uninsured million bbb baa heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiary bb baa cumulative preferred stock selected series not rated baa the above ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency  from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating corresponds to heco s rating senior unsecured debt rating by s p or issuer rating by moody s because  as a result of rating agency actions to lower or withdraw the ratings of these bond insurers after the bonds were issued  heco s current ratings are either higher than the current rating of the applicable bond insurer or the bond insurer is not rated 
following mbia insurance corporation s mbia s announced restructuring in february  the revenue bonds issued for the benefit of heco and its subsidiaries and insured by mbia have been reinsured by mbia insurance corp 
of illinois mbia illinois  whose name was subsequently changed to national public finance guarantee corp 
national 
the financial strength rating of national by s p is bbb 
moody s ratings on securities that are guaranteed or wrapped by a financial guarantor are generally maintained at a level equal to the higher of the rating of the guarantor if rated at the investment grade level or the published underlying rating 
the insurance financial strength rating of national by moody s is baa  which is the same as moody s issuer rating for heco 
management believes that  if heco s commercial paper ratings were to be further downgraded or if credit markets were to further tighten  it would be even more difficult and expensive to sell commercial paper or secure other short term borrowings 
similarly  management believes that if heco s long term credit ratings 
table of contents were to be further downgraded  or if credit markets further tighten  it could be even more difficult and or expensive for dbf and or the company to sell special purpose revenue bonds and other debt securities  respectively  for the benefit of the utilities in the future 
such limitations and or increased costs could materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of heco and its subsidiaries 
the puc must approve issuances  if any  of equity and long term debt securities by heco  helco and meco 
revenue bonds are issued by the dbf to finance capital improvement projects of heco and its subsidiaries  but the source of their repayment is the unsecured obligations of heco and its subsidiaries under loan agreements and notes issued to the dbf  including heco s guarantees of its subsidiaries obligations 
the payment of principal and interest due on sprbs currently outstanding and issued prior to are insured either by ambac assurance corporation  financial guaranty insurance company  mbia which bonds have been reinsured by national public finance guarantee corp 
or syncora guarantee inc which bonds have been reinsured by syncora capital assurance inc 
the insured outstanding revenue bonds were initially issued with s p and moody s ratings of aaa and aaa  respectively  based on the ratings at the time of issuance of the applicable bond insurer 
beginning in  however  ratings of the insurers or their predecessors were downgraded and or withdrawn by s p and moody s  resulting in a downgrade of the bond ratings of all of the bonds as shown in the ratings table above 
the million of sprbs sold by the dbf for the benefit of heco and helco on july   were sold without bond insurance 
management believes that if heco s long term credit ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets further tighten  it could be even more difficult and or expensive to sell bonds in the future 
on november   the puc approved the request of heco  helco and meco for the sale of each utility s common stock over a five year period from through heco s sale to hei of up to million and helco and meco s sales to heco of up to million and million  respectively  and the purchase of the helco and meco common stock by heco

financing activities used net cash of million for the payment of common and preferred stock dividends of million  partly offset by million net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
for the five year period through  the utilities forecast billion of gross capital expenditures  approximately of which is for transmission and distribution projects and for generation projects  with the remaining for general plant and other projects 
these estimates do not include expenditures  which could be material  related to significant renewable energy infrastructure projects or environmental compliance requirements not currently contemplated for that period 
the electric utilities net capital expenditures which exclude afudc and capital expenditures funded by third party contributions in aid of construction for through are currently estimated to total approximately billion 
heco s consolidated cash flows from operating activities net income for common stock  adjusted for non cash income and expense items such as depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  after the payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends  are currently not expected to provide sufficient cash to cover the forecasted net capital expenditures 
debt and equity financing are expected to be required to fund this estimated shortfall as well as to refinance maturing revenue bonds million in and million in and to fund any unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs or acceleration of the construction of capital projects  capital expenditures that may be required by new environmental laws and regulations  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements and higher tax payments that would result if tax positions taken by the utilities do not prevail 
proceeds from the issuances of equity  cash flows from operating activities  temporary increases in short term borrowings and existing cash and cash equivalents are expected to provide the forecast million needed for the net capital expenditures in for  gross capital expenditures are estimated to be million  including approximately million for transmission and distribution projects  approximately million for generation projects and approximately million for general plant and other

consolidated net capital expenditures for heco and subsidiaries for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects 
these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load  the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generation units  the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors  the need for fuel infrastructure investments  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases  escalation in construction costs  commitments under the energy agreement  the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities

the electric utilities were required to make contributions of million for  but not required to make any contributions for and to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa  including changes promulgated by the pension protection act of the electric utilities made voluntary contributions in  and contributions by the electric utilities to the retirement benefit plans for  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  and are expected to total million in in addition  the electric utilities paid directly million of benefits in  less than million of benefits in each of and and expect to pay less than million of benefits in depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the electric utilities believe they will have adequate cash flow or access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements

hcei energy agreement 
heco  for itself and its subsidiaries  entered into the energy agreement on october  see hawaii clean energy initiative in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the far reaching nature of the energy agreement  including the extent of renewable energy commitments and implementation of a new regulatory model which will decouple revenues from sales  present new increased risks to the company 
among such risks are the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy  which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such ipps or if a major ipp fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement  could impact the utilities achievement of their commitments under the energy agreement and or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service  delays in acquiring or unavailability of non fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation  the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively  the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure  which could result in increased borrowings and materially impact the financial condition and cash flows of the utilities  and the commitment to support a variety of initiatives  which  if approved by the puc  may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  decoupling revenues from sales  implementing feed in tariffs to encourage development of renewable energy  removing the system wide caps on net energy metering but studying dg interconnections on a per circuit basis  and developing an energy efficiency portfolio standard 
management cannot predict the ultimate impact or outcome of the implementation of these or other hcei programs on the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the electric utilities 
regulation of electric utility rates 
the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services  and the timeliness of permitted rate increases  are among the most important items influencing their financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the puc has broad discretion over the rates the electric 
table of contents utilities charge and other matters 
any adverse decision by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the items and amounts permitted to be included in rate base  the authorized returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse affect on the company s and heco s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
through december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues with respect to interim orders 
management cannot predict when the final d os in pending or future rate cases will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
further  the increasing levels of o m expenses including increased retirement benefit costs  increased plant in service  and other factors have and are likely to continue to result in the electric utilities seeking rate relief more often than in the past 
fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in compared to in and in failure or delay by the electric utilities oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major ipp to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its ppa  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to days of forward consumption 
helco and meco generally maintain an inventory level equivalent to one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities ppas require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity ppas include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other operation and maintenance expenses 
other o m expenses increased  and for  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year  and respectively  excluding dsm program expense 
this trend of increased o m expenses is expected to continue in as the electric utilities expect higher production expenses primarily to maintain and improve the efficiency of the production units  and higher costs for material and contract services 
transmission and distribution expenses are also expected to increase consistent with the new asset management initiatives to modernize the infrastructure 
the timing and amount of these expenses can vary as circumstances change 
for example  recent overhauls have been more expensive than in the past due to the larger scope of work necessary to maintain aging equipment  which has experienced heavier usage as demand has increased to current levels 
also  the cost of overhauls can be higher than originally planned after full assessments of the repair work are performed 
in addition  the costs of environmental compliance continue to increase with more stringent regulatory requirements 
increased o m expenses were among the reasons heco  helco and meco filed requests with the puc in recent years to increase base rates 
the successful implementation of decoupling mechanisms may partially and more promptly mitigate the negative net income impact of rising other o m expenses 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project consisting of ct 
table of contents  ct and st and the east oahu transmission project  encountered opposition and were seriously delayed before being placed in service  with a write down being required for the keahole project 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional regulatory contingencies 
competition 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
in october  the puc opened investigative proceedings on two specific issues competitive bidding and dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
competitive bidding proceeding 
in december  the puc issued a decision that included a final competitive bidding framework  which became effective immediately 
the final framework states  among other things  that under the framework a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the puc finds bidding to be unsuitable  the framework does not apply in certain situations identified in the framework  waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered  the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the puc whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal ie  in competition with those offered by bidders  the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its rfp  and for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply due to waiver or exemption  the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a qualifying facility qf at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the puc 
management cannot currently predict the ultimate effect of the framework on the ability of the utilities to acquire or build additional generating capacity in the future 
the utilities received approval for waivers from the competitive framework to negotiate modifications to existing ppas that generate electricity from renewable resources 
also  certain renewable energy projects were grandfathered from the competitive bidding process 
the puc can also grant waivers on its own volition to renewable energy projects that are not exempt from the competitive bidding framework as was done in december for four mw solar facilities proposed for oahu 
distributed generation proceeding 
in january  the puc issued a d o indicating that its policy is to promote the development of a market structure that assures distributed generation dg is available at the lowest feasible cost  dg that is economical and reliable has an opportunity to come to fruition and dg that is not cost effective does not enter the system 
the d o affirmed the ability of the utilities to procure and operate dg for utility purposes at utility sites 
the puc also indicated its desire to promote the development of a competitive market for customer sited dg 
the puc found that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of allowing a utility to provide dg services on a customer s site 
however  the puc also found that the utility is the most informed potential provider of dg and it would not be in the public interest to exclude the utilities from providing dg services at this early stage of dg market development 
therefore  the d o allows the utility to provide dg services on a customer owned site as a regulated service when the dg resolves a legitimate system need  the dg is the lowest cost alternative to meet that need and it can be shown that  in an open and competitive process acceptable to the puc  the customer operator was unable to find another entity ready and able to supply the proposed dg service at a price and quality comparable to the utility s offering 
in april  the puc provided clarification to the conditions under which the utilities are allowed to provide regulated dg services eg  the utilities can use a portfolio perspective a dg project aggregated with other dg systems and other supply side and demand side options to support a finding that utility owned customer sited dg projects fulfill a legitimate system need  and the economic standard of least cost in the order means lowest reasonable cost consistent with the standard in the irp framework 
in march  the puc approved the amended agreement between heco and the state of hawaii department of transportation to develop a dispatchable standby generation facility at the honolulu international airport that will be owned by the state and operated by heco 
the puc also waived the project 
table of contents from the competitive bidding framework 
the dispatchable standby generation facility is projected to be in operation in july heco is also evaluating the potential to develop utility owned dg at oahu military bases in order to meet utility system needs and the energy objectives of the federal department of defense dod 
in february  the puc approved a meco agreement for the installation at a hotel site on the island of lanai of a chp system  which was placed in service in september dg tariff proceeding 
in  the puc approved modifications to the utilities interconnection tariffs and a standby service tariff 
in january  the utilities requested modifications of the dg interconnection tariff 
in may  the puc approved certain modifications that had been stipulated to by the parties  including modifying requirements for conducting detailed interconnection studies  establishing a standard three party interconnection agreement  including cross limitation of liability and non indemnification language with respect to projects where a state of hawaii agency is the customer  and requiring additional information regarding the customer s generating facility 
the remaining issues continue to be evaluated in the proceeding 
dg and distributed energy storage under the energy agreement 
under the energy agreement  the utilities committed to facilitate planning for distributed energy resources through a new clean energy scenario planning process 
under this process  locational value maps were developed in to identify areas where dg and distributed energy storage would provide utility system benefits and can be reasonably accommodated 
the utilities also agreed to power utility owned dg using sustainable biofuels or other renewable technologies and fuels  and to support either customer owned or utility owned distributed energy storage 
the utilities are currently planning distributed energy storage research  development and demonstration projects for installation in the parties to the energy agreement support reconsideration of the puc s restrictions on utility owned dg where it is proven that utility ownership and dispatch clearly benefits grid reliability and ratepayer interests  and the equipment is competitively procured 
the parties also support heco s dispatchable standby generation units upon showing reasonable ratepayer benefits 
the utilities may contract with third parties to aggregate fleets of dg or standby generators for utility dispatch or under ppas  or may undertake such aggregation themselves if no third parties respond to a solicitation for such services 
the energy agreement also provides that to the degree that transmission and distribution automation and other smart grid technology investments are needed to facilitate distributed energy resource utilization  those investments should be recoverable through a clean energy infrastructure surcharge which was replaced by the renewable energy infrastructure program surcharge and later placed in rate base in the next rate case proceeding 
environmental matters 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the hawaii department of health doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the epa 
the hawaii state legislature passed legislation that requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
meeting this requirement results in increased project costs 
the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter resulted in substantial changes for the electric utility industry 
further significant impacts may occur under newly adopted rules eg  one hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide  control of ghgs under the ghg psd and title v tailoring rule  under rules deemed applicable to the utilities facilities eg  regional haze rule  if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted eg  ghg emission reduction rules  or if new legislation  rules or standards are adopted in the future 
similarly  soon to be issued rules governing cooling water intake may significantly impact heco s steam generating facilities on oahu 

table of contents see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities or that the related costs will be recoverable through rates 
additional environmental compliance costs are expected to be incurred as a result of the initiatives called for in the energy agreement  including permitting and siting costs for new facilities and testing and permitting costs related to changing to the use of biofuels 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc  but no assurance can be given that this will in fact be the case 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of fuel cells  dg and generation from renewable sources may impact the electric utility s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
heco and its subsidiaries evaluate the impact of applying lease accounting standards to their new ppas  ppa amendments and other arrangements they enter into 
a possible outcome of the evaluation is that an arrangement results in its classification as a capital lease  which could have a material effect on heco s consolidated balance sheet if a significant amount of capital assets of the ipp and lease obligations needed to be recorded 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the discussion under major projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs of major projects that have not yet been approved for inclusion in the applicable utility s rate base 
regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with accounting standards for regulatory operations  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable 
as of december   the consolidated regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets of the utilities amounted to million and million  respectively  compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of december  is probable 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the 
table of contents electric utilities expect that the regulatory assets would be charged to expense and the regulatory liabilities would be credited to income or refunded to ratepayers immediately 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense or if regulatory liabilities are required to be refunded to ratepayers immediately 
revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers 
as of december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
as of december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of such revenues with respect to interim orders 
also  the rate schedules of the electric utilities include ecacs under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows may result if the utilities were to lose their ecacs 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
a business enterprise must evaluate whether it should consolidate a vie 
the company evaluates the impact of applying accounting standards for consolidation to its relationships with ipps with whom the utilities execute new ppas or execute amendments of existing ppas 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries  as applicable may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie the ipp which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes

bank executive overview and strategy 
when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth  but has been optimizing its balance sheet in recent years as a result of its multi year performance improvement project  which has resulted in a reduction in asset size and a concomitant improvement in profitability and capital efficiency 
asb ended with assets of billion and net income of million  compared to assets of billion as of december  and net income of million in the weak national economic environment and declines in the national housing market in and impacted securities in asb s investment portfolio 
the rating agencies downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgage related securities in  including several mortgage related securities held in asb s portfolio 
during  asb sold its private issue mortgage related securities portfolio to reduce its credit risk and improve the prospects for consistent future earnings 
the sales resulted in a net charge of million million pretax in the fourth quarter of asb also improved its interest rate risk by selling substantially all of its salable fixed rate residential loan production during and more than of its fixed rate residential loan production in the first nine months of into the secondary market 
a portion of the excess liquidity was used to pay off other borrowings that were maturing 
also in  asb recorded a net charge of million million pretax for other than temporary impairment otti in the value of securities and a higher provision for loan losses than in and asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers 
in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value  asb continues to develop and introduce new products and services in order to meet the needs of those markets 
additionally  the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive 
asb s ongoing challenge is to continue to increase revenues and control expenses after the completion of its performance improvement project 

table of contents the interest rate environment and the quality of asb s assets will continue to impact its financial results 
asb continues to face a challenging interest rate environment 
the weak global  national and local economic environments have resulted in a persistent  low level of interest rates  weak loan demand  and excess liquidity in the financial system 
in addition  expectations are increasing that interest rates will rise rapidly once there are strong signs that the economic recovery is taking hold 
asb s decision to sell substantial fixed rate mortgage production in and  weak loan demand  and challenges in finding investments with adequate risk adjusted returns resulted in declining loan balances and an increase in asb s liquidity position  which had a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
the potential for compression of asb s margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost  core deposits  particularly those in non interest bearing transaction accounts  reducing the overall exposure to fixed rate residential mortgage loans and diversifying the loan portfolio with higher spread  shorter maturity loans or variable rate loans such as commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans  managing costing liabilities to optimize cost of funds and manage interest rate sensitivity  and focusing new investments on shorter duration or variable rate securities 
although asb s loan quality improved in  there are still signs of financial stress in the hawaii and mainland markets 
the slowdown in the economy  both nationally and locally  has resulted in asb experiencing higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses  which were concentrated in the vacant land portfolio and on the neighbor islands 
as a result  asb s provision for loan losses had increased in and remained at a high level in  following several years of historically low loan losses and loan loss allowances 
while a mild recovery began in as the global economic recovery began to take hold  many challenges remain and the outlook for the hawaii economy is for a slow  steady recovery 
consumers and businesses are expected to recover slowly in as gradual improvement in measures such as job growth  unemployment and real personal income are expected 
continued financial stress on asb s customers may result in higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses

table of contents earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities 
the current interest rate environment is impacted by disruptions in the financial markets and these conditions may have a negative impact on asb s net interest margin 
loan originations and mortgage related securities are asb s primary sources of earning assets

asb s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates  competition  demand for financing  availability of funds and management s responses to these factors 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s loans receivable 
the decrease in the total loan portfolio from billion at the end of to billion at the end of was primarily due to asb s strategic decision to sell most of the salable residential loans it originated during million of loans sold 
loan portfolio risk elements 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly  the loan is classified as delinquent 
if delinquencies are not cured promptly  asb normally commences a collection action  including foreclosure proceedings in the case of secured loans 
in a foreclosure action  the property securing the delinquent debt is sold at a public auction in which asb may participate as a bidder to protect its interest 
if asb is the successful bidder  the property is classified as real estate owned until it is sold

principal and interest on mortgage related securities issued by fnma  fhlmc and gnma are guaranteed by the issuer  and the securities carry implied aaa ratings 
the unrealized gains on asb s investment in federal agency mortgage backed securities were primarily caused by lower interest rates 
the low interest rate environment coupled with tighter spreads on all mortgage collateralized securities caused the market value of the securities held to increase above the carrying book value 
all contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the us government 
see investment and mortgage related securities in note for a discussion of securities impairment assessment 
as of december  and  asb did not have any private issue mortgage related securities 
at december   the pmrs portfolio had million of unrealized losses  due to multiple factors primarily related to deterioration in the residential housing market and spread widening for all credit sensitive sectors of the market 
increasing foreclosures coupled with recessionary employment pressures and declining housing prices had depressed the values of all private issue mortgage collateralized securities as risks for this sector had increased 
changes in credit rating for issues originated in and had dramatically depressed 
table of contents valuations in this sector of the portfolio 
in  asb recorded an otti charge of million on two pmrs 
in the fourth quarter of  asb sold its pmrs portfolio and had no otti as of december  deposits and other borrowings 
deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for asb and are affected by market interest rates  competition and management s responses to these factors 
deposit retention and growth will remain challenging in the current environment due to competition for deposits and the level of short term interest rates 
advances from the fhlb of seattle and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be additional sources of funds 
as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings 
as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s deposit liabilities and other borrowings 
other factors 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations and also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of asb s investment securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair value of those instruments 
in addition  changes in credit spreads also impact the fair values of those instruments 
although higher long term interest rates or other conditions in credit markets such as the effects of the deteriorated subprime market could reduce the market value of available for sale investment and mortgage related securities and reduce shareholder s equity through a balance sheet charge to aoci  this reduction in the market value of investments and mortgage related securities would not result in a charge to net income in the absence of a sale of such securities such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of and in the balance sheet restructure or an otti in the value of the securities 
as of december  and december   asb had unrealized gains  net of taxes  on available for sale investments and mortgage related securities including securities pledged for repurchase agreements in aoci of million and million  respectively 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legislation and regulation 
asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of thrift supervision ots  whose regulatory functions are to be transferred to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ as described below  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on asb s level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholder

dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act 
regulation of the financial services industry  including regulation of hei and asb  will undergo substantial changes as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act  which became law in july the dodd frank act increases regulation and oversight of the financial services industry and imposes restrictions on the ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices 
most importantly for hei and asb  the dodd frank act will abolish their historical federal financial institution regulator  the ots  effective one year from the enactment date subject to extension by not more than an additional six months 
supervision and regulation of hei  as a thrift holding company  will move to the federal reserve  and supervision and regulation of asb  as a federally chartered savings bank  will move to the occ 
while the laws and regulations applicable to hei and asb will not generally change the home owners loan act and regulations issued thereunder will still apply the applicable laws and regulations will be interpreted  and new and amended regulations will be adopted  by the federal reserve and the occ 
hei will for the first time be subject to minimum consolidated capital requirements  and asb may be required to be supervised through ashi  its intermediate holding company 
the dodd frank act requires regulators  at a minimum  to apply to bank and thrift holding companies leverage and risk based capital standards that are at least as strict as those in effect at the insured depository institution level on the date the act became effective  although there will be a phase in period for meeting these standards 
in addition  hei will continue to be required to serve as a source of strength to asb in the event of its financial distress 
the dodd frank act also imposes new restrictions on the ability of a savings bank to pay dividends should it fail to remain a qualified thrift lender 

table of contents more stringent affiliate transaction rules will apply to asb in the securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives areas 
standards are raised with respect to the ability of asb to merge with or acquire another institution 
while the dodd frank act requires the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to be increased from to by  the fdic is required to offset the effect of this increase for depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion 
based on the proposed changes to the assessment base and rates  asb anticipates a reduction in its annual fdic assessment by approximately million 
asb may be affected by the provision of the dodd frank act that repeals  effective in july unless extended  the prohibition on payments of interest by banks or savings associations on demand deposit accounts for businesses 
the dodd frank act establishes a consumer financial protection bureau bureau to be housed in the federal reserve to take sole responsibility subject to limited oversight by the new financial stability oversight council for rulemaking under the principal federal consumer financial protection laws  such as the truth in lending act  real estate settlement procedures act  equal credit opportunity act  truth in savings act  fair debt collection practices act and several other consumer protection laws  but enforcement of these laws and rules will be by the occ in the case of asb because it has less than billion in assets 
the bureau will have broad power in that it will have authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair  deceptive or abusive  and it may also issue rules requiring specified disclosures  including the use of new model forms it may adopt 
asb may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the dodd frank act that acknowledges that a federal savings bank may be subject to state regulation and only allows federal law to preempt state law on a case by case basis in the consumer financial protection area when the state law would have a discriminatory effect on the bank compared to that on a bank chartered in that state  the state law prevents or significantly interferes with a bank s exercise of its power  or the state law is preempted by another federal law 
the dodd frank act also adopts a number of provisions that will impact the mortgage industry  including the imposition of new specific duties on the part of mortgage originators such as asb to act in the best interests of consumers and to take steps to ensure that consumers will have the capability to repay loans they may obtain  as well as provisions imposing new disclosure requirements and requiring appraisal reforms 
regulations are required to be adopted under these provisions of the dodd frank act within months after the date that is to be specified by the secretary of the treasury for the transfer of consumer protection power to the bureau 
asb cannot predict at this time what effect these new rules may ultimately have on its mortgage origination practices  its ability to originate mortgage loans or the costs it will incur in complying with these requirements 
the dodd frank act will affect financial regulation more generally as well  although many of these regulatory changes may not impact asb or the company directly  either because they are limited in application to larger entities or because they relate to activities in which asb is not substantially engaged 
for example  the dodd frank act establishes a financial stability oversight council that would  among other things  designate certain nonbank financial companies that it considers to be of systemic risk to be supervised by the federal reserve  as well as monitor the financial markets for trends affecting systemic risk and coordinate the regulatory activities of the federal bank regulators 
it also would establish a mechanism for the fdic to resolve systemically important companies that may fail 
the ability of companies to engage in derivatives transactions and hedge for their own account likely will be impacted by provisions in the dodd frank act that require such transactions to be moved to exchanges and for capital and margin to be held against them  as well as by the so called volcker rule  which will limit the ability of financial institutions to invest for their own account once the rule becomes effective but with exceptions important to asb  such as for purchases of us government or agency obligations 
the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve to issue rules to ensure that debit card interchange fees are reasonable and proportional to the processing costs incurred 
the federal reserve has proposed a cap on debit card interchange fees that card issuers can receive to cents per transaction 
asb currently earns an average of cents per transaction 
as specified in the dodd frank act  these regulations will exempt banks with less than billion in assets 
however  market pressures could very well push the impact down to all banks 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  as amended  will not become effective until a year or more after its enactment  when implementing regulations are issued and effective 
thus  management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act  as amended  on the company or asb at this time 
nor can management predict the impact or substance of other future federal or state legislation or regulation  or the application thereof 
credit card act 
on may   president obama signed the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of into law 
among other things  it requires that consumers receive a reasonable amount of time to make their credit card payments  prohibits payment allocation methods that 
table of contents unfairly maximize interest charges  prohibits issuers from raising the interest rate on an existing credit card balance in certain circumstances  and prohibits issuers from charging over limit fees unless the cardholder agreed to allow the issuer to complete over limit transactions and restricts the manner in which the issuer may assess over limit fees 
the major provisions of the act were effective february  new overdraft rules 
on november   the board of governors of the federal reserve system announced that it amended regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act to limit the ability of a financial institution to assess an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine or one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the institution s payment of overdrafts for those transactions 
these new rules applied on july  for new accounts and august  for existing accounts 
in  these types of overdraft fees totaled approximately million pretax 
the amendment had a negative impact on asb s noninterest income of approximately million pretax for the second half of fhlb of seattle stock 
as of december   asb s investment in stock of the fhlb of seattle of million was carried at cost because it can only be redeemed at par 
there is a minimum required investment based on measurements of asb s capital  assets and or borrowing levels 
the fhlb of seattle reported net income of million for nine months ended september  compared to a net loss of million for the nine months ended september  the fhlb of seattle reported retained earnings of million as of september  and was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements 
in october  the fhlb of seattle entered into a stipulation and consent to the issuance of a consent order with the federal housing finance agency  which requires the fhlb of seattle to take certain actions related to its business and operations 
the consents provide that  following a stabilization period and once the fhlb of seattle reaches and maintains certain thresholds  it may redeem or repurchase capital stock and begin paying dividends 
asb does not believe that the consents will affect the fhlb of seattle s ability to meet asb s liquidity and funding needs 
asb received cash dividends on its million of fhlb of seattle stock of million in  nil in and nil in commitments and contingencies

liquidity and capital resources 
december change change dollars in millions total assets available for sale investment and mortgage related securities loans receivable  net deposit liabilities other bank borrowings as of december   asb was one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on assets of billion and deposits of billion 
in july  moody s affirmed asb s counterparty credit rating of a and changed asb s outlook to stable from negative based on asb s better than expected asset quality and earnings performance in the last several periods 
in april  s p raised asb s long term short term counterparty credit ratings to bbb a from bbb a and in july maintained the rating following its annual review of asb 
these ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any hei or heco securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
asb s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  borrowings and the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities 
asb s deposits as of december  were million lower than december  asb s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the fhlb and securities sold 
table of contents under agreements to repurchase from broker dealers 
as of december   fhlb borrowings totaled approximately million  representing of assets 
asb is approved to borrow from the fhlb up to of asb s assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
as of december   asb s unused fhlb borrowing capacity was approximately billion 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million  representing of assets 
asb utilizes deposits  advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans and purchase investment and mortgage related securities 
as of december   asb had commitments to borrowers for undisbursed loan funds  loan commitments and unused lines and letters of credit of billion 
management believes asb s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels 
as of december  and  asb had million and million of loans on nonaccrual status  respectively  or and of net loans outstanding  respectively 
as of december  and  asb had million and million  respectively  of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
in  operating activities provided cash of million 
net cash of million was used by investing activities primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities and capital expenditures  partly offset by net decreases in loans held for investment  repayments of investment and mortgage related securities and proceeds from the sale of real estate 
financing activities used net cash of million due to net decreases in other borrowings and deposits and the payment of common stock dividends 
asb believes that maintaining a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence  affords protection to depositors  helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions  such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized see capital requirements below for asb s capital ratios 
for a discussion of asb dividends  see common stock equity in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
also see forward looking statements and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition for consolidated hei above 
competition 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is one of hawaii s largest financial institutions  based on total assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher spread  shorter duration 
table of contents consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
asb s strategic sales of its private issue mortgage related securities in the fourth quarter of and substantially all of its salable residential loan production during and more than of its residential loan production in helped to reduce its exposure to credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
persistent low levels of interest rates  weak loan demand  and excess liquidity in the financial system have made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns  resulting in declining loan balances and an increase in asb s liquidity position  with a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s net interest margin will continue 
asb also manages the credit risk associated with its lending and securities portfolios  but a deep and prolonged recession led by a material decline in housing prices could materially impair the value of its portfolios 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  significant advances in internet banking may impact asb s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
prior to extending a loan secured by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
regulation 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the department of treasury  ots and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the ots 
capital requirements 
the ots  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with ots minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of ots prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses as of december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses as of december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from 
table of contents operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to hei through ashi and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei currently could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary  to maintain asb s capital position 
examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the ots 
in conducting its examinations  the ots utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the ots examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the ots s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the ots also regularly examines asb s information technology practices and its performance under community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 
qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
savings associations that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  ashi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if asb failed to maintain its qtl status  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of asb s assets were qualified thrift investments 
unitary savings and loan holding company 
the gramm act permitted banks  insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricted the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  ashi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 
there have been legislative proposals in the past which would operate to eliminate the 
table of contents thrift charter or the grandfathered status of hei as a unitary thrift holding company and effectively require the divestiture of asb 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
investment and mortgage related securities 
asb owns federal agency obligations and mortgage related securities issued by the fnma  gnma and fhlmc and municipal bonds  all of which are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in aoci 
asb views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy since the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see investment and mortgage related securities in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of securities impairment assessment and other than temporary impaired securities 
prices for investments and mortgage related securities are provided by independent market participants and are based on observable inputs using market based valuation techniques 
the prices of these securities may be influenced by factors such as market liquidity  corporate credit considerations of the underlying collateral  the levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns  and overall market psychology 
adverse changes in any of these factors may result in losses  and such losses could be material 
as of december   asb had investment and mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion 
allowance for loan losses 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussion above under earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
as of december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
in  asb recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the credit risk ratings assigned to asb s loan portfolio and loss ratios inherent in the asb loan portfolio at any given point in time 
a sensitivity analysis provides insight regarding the impact that adverse changes in credit risk ratings may have on asb s allowance for loan losses 
at december   in the event that of the homogenous loans move down one delinquency classification eg  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of non homogenous loans were downgraded one credit risk rating category for each category eg  of the loans in the pass category moved to the special mention category  of the loans in the special mention category moved to the substandard category  of the loans in the substandard category moved to the doubtful category and of the loans in the doubtful category moved to the loss category  the allowance for loan losses would have increased by approximately million 
the sensitivity analyses do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in asb loans risk ratings and they do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for loan losses due to the numerous quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determining asb s allowance for loan losses 
the example above is only one of a number of possible scenarios 
although management believes asb s allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy or real estate market  and material increases in those amounts could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents heco the information required by this item is set forth in heco s md a  incorporated herein by reference to page of heco exhibit item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and the other segment s exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with asb s lending portfolios is controlled through its underwriting standards  loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated through investment portfolio limits  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to the fuel supply and ipp contracts of the electric utilities 
the company s commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as the electric utilities have their current ecacs in their rate schedules 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
the company currently has no exposure to market risk from trading activities nor foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities  the market value of retirement benefit plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 
bank interest rate risk the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
many other factors also affect asb s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and competition for loans or deposits 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management of asb measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario 
table of contents specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios are created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion  over the next twelve month period  in increments of basis points 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets  future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities  and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
asb s net portfolio value npv ratio is a measure of the economic capitalization of asb 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value of asb to the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets 
net portfolio value represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio is calculated by asb pursuant to guidelines established by the ots in thrift bulletin a and the ots net portfolio value model manual 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s npv ratio include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities 
typically  if the value of asb s assets grows relative to the value of its liabilities  the npv ratio will increase 
conversely  if the value of asb s liabilities grows relative to the value of its assets  the npv ratio will decrease 
the npv ratio is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is the change from the npv ratio calculated in the base case to the npv ratio calculated in the alternate rate scenarios 
the sensitivity measure alone is not necessarily indicative of the interest rate risk of an institution  as institutions with high levels of capital may be able to support a high sensitivity measure 
this measure is evaluated in conjunction with the npv ratio calculated in each scenario 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in interest rates change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity basis points gradual change instantaneous change gradual change instantaneous change base change from base case in basis points bp 
management believes that asb s interest rate risk position as of december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
under the rising interest rate scenarios  the december  nii profile was more liability sensitive compared to december  due primarily to changes in the asset mix 

table of contents asb s base npv ratio as of december  increased compared to december  due to the higher relative value of the mortgage portfolio and the decrease in size and change in mix of the balance sheet 
asb s npv ratio sensitivity as of december  was less sensitive in the rising rate scenarios compared to december  as the asset mix shifted from longer duration mortgages to shorter duration loans and investments 
the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity  npv ratio  and npv ratio sensitivity analyses is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk 
the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
further  the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period 
these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements  the level of future earnings  or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon 
the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change  actual changes in asb s balance sheet  and management s responses to the changes in interest rates 
other than bank interest rate risk the company s general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt  long term debt currently fixed rate debt and preferred securities 
as of december   management believes the company is exposed to other than bank interest rate risk because of its periodic borrowing requirements  the impact of interest rates on the discount rate and the market value of plan assets used to determine retirement benefits expenses and obligations see retirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefits in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities allowed rates of return see electric utility certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition regulation of electric utility rates 
other than these exposures  management believes its exposure to other than bank interest rate risk is not material 
the company s longer term debt  in the form of revenue bonds and medium term notes  is at fixed rates 
therefore  the estimated fair value of such debt is lower than the amount outstanding see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of forward starting swaps to manage some of the interest rate risk associated with hei s planned issuance of long term debt in the future
