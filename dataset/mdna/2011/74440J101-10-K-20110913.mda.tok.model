table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop tiny  sustained release  drug delivery products designed to deliver drugs at a controlled and steady rate for months or years 
we are currently focused on treatment of chronic diseases of the back of the eye utilizing our core technology systems  durasert and biosilicon 
iluvien for the treatment of dme  our most advanced product candidate  is currently under review by the fda 
an investigator sponsored ind opened for an injectable insert designed to treat uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye posterior uveitis of the same design as iluvien and an investigator sponsored trial is ongoing for an injectable bioerodible insert designed to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension 
our two fda approved products provide long term  sustained drug delivery to treat two other chronic diseases of the retina 
iluvien 
we licensed the third generation injectable durasert insert that delivers fac over a period of up to years to alimera for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis 
this insert is being developed by alimera under its brand name iluvien 
alimera completed two phase iii clinical trials fame study of iluvien for the treatment of dme  a leading cause of vision loss for people under the age of estimated to affect over  people in the united states 
alimera submitted an nda for iluvien for dme to the fda in june based on month data from the fame study  received a crl in december and resubmitted an nda to the fda to respond to the crl in may alimera expects a response from the fda in november alimera stated that if approved  it plans to commercialize iluvien for dme in the us as soon as early in july  alimera submitted a marketing authorization application for iluvien for dme to the mhra in the united kingdom and to other regulatory authorities in europe 
alimera reports that it anticipates submitting the final response to the mhra and the other european regulatory authorities by december  under our collaboration agreement with alimera  in addition to treating dme  iluvien is also being studied in three phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of the dry form of amd  the wet form of amd and rvo 
other product development 
in september  an investigator sponsored ind opened for a phase i ii study of the safety and efficacy of our injectable  sustained release insert delivering fac for the treatment of uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye posterior uveitis 
the insert is the same design as the insert being developed by alimera for the treatment of dme and delivers the high and low dose of fac used in the fame study 
we did not license alimera the rights to use the insert for uveitis 
if successful  we plan to advance this product candidate into pivotal multi center phase iii trials and reference the nda for iluvien for dme including the clinical data from the fame study and the manufacturing and stability data in potential posterior uveitis regulatory filings 
we also plan to use a new inserter  with a smaller gauge needle than that used in the fame study  in any future posterior uveitis phase iii trials 
under our restated pfizer agreement  we granted pfizer an exclusive option under various circumstances to license the development and commercialization worldwide of an injectable  bioerodible sustained release insert delivering latanoprost latanoprost product for the treatment of human ophthalmic disease or conditions other than uveitis 
an investigator sponsored phase i ii dose escalation study has been initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of this insert  which utilizes a fourth generation of our durasert technology  in patients with elevated iop 
we are currently developing a prototype of this implant that contains biosilicon to assist in the delivery of latanoprost 
if successful  we plan to advance the new prototype into a multi center phase ii trial 

table of contents in august  we entered into an evaluation agreement with hss to investigate our durasert drug delivery technologies in orthopedics 
approved products 
our two fda approved products utilize two earlier generations of our durasert technology system  second generation retisert for the treatment of posterior uveitis  and first generation vitrasert for the treatment of aids related cytomegalovirus cmv retinitis 
we have licensed both of these products and the technologies underlying them to bausch lomb 
retisert delivers fac to provide sustained release treatment for approximately two and a half years  and vitrasert delivers ganciclovir to provide sustained release treatment for six to nine months 
biosilicon 
biosilicon  the second key technology system we are targeting for sustained drug delivery  utilizes fully erodible  nanostructured  porous material 
our primary focus is on tethadur  which utilizes biosilicon to deliver large biologic molecules  including peptides and proteins  on a sustained basis 
our biosilicon technology is also designed to deliver smaller molecules 
equity financings in january  we sold  units at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase share of common stock at per share 
license and collaboration agreements alimera upon execution of the restated alimera agreement in march  we received consideration of million in cash and alimera cancelled million of accrued development cost liabilities  including related penalties and accrued interest  owed by us to alimera as of march  in addition  we received a million conditional note subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain defined liquidity events  alimera agreed to pay us a million milestone payment upon fda approval of iluvien for dme and alimera assumed all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products under the restated alimera agreement  which had previously been shared equally  including reimbursement of approved development costs incurred by us in support of the ongoing clinical studies of iluvien and anticipated regulatory submissions 
in exchange  we decreased our share in any future profits  as defined  on sales of iluvien by alimera from to  subject to an offset of of pre profitability commercialization costs  as defined  incurred by alimera 
in the event alimera sublicenses commercialization  we are entitled to receive of royalties and of non royalty consideration received by alimera  less certain permitted deductions 
alimera has indicated that it intends to commercialize iluvien  if approved  through a direct sales force in the united states and to seek marketing collaboration partners for the commercialization of iluvien outside of the united states 
pursuant to the restated alimera agreement  a total of million of deferred revenue was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the month performance obligation period from the amendment effective date through december  following consummation of the restated alimera agreement  we received conditional note interest payments and reimbursements of approved development and patent maintenance costs totaling  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
in addition  on april   following consummation of its initial public offering  alimera paid the million conditional note in full 
cash consideration received from alimera during the performance period was recognized as revenue ratably over the performance period  including immediate revenue recognition catch up for the pro rata period from the amendment effective date to the date of each receipt 
cash consideration received subsequent to december  has been recognized as revenue upon receipt or at such earlier date  if applicable  on which any such amount is both fixed and determinable and reasonably assured of collection 

table of contents pfizer under the original pfizer agreement  beginning in calendar year pfizer paid us  quarterly in consideration of our costs in performing the research program 
because we were unable to define the period of our performance obligations under this agreement  all payments received from pfizer  totaling million  were classified in non current deferred revenue 
in june  we entered into the restated pfizer agreement to focus solely on the development of a sustained release bioerodible implant designed to deliver latanoprost by subconjuntival injection 
the original pfizer agreement was effectively terminated  including the cessation of pfizer s  quarterly funding of the research program 
in addition  we regained all rights to our intellectual property in ophthalmic applications previously included in the original pfizer agreement other than pursuant to the restated pfizer agreement 
upon execution of the restated pfizer agreement  pfizer made an upfront payment of million and we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to fund development of the latanoprost product for at least one year and  thereafter  at our option  through completion of phase ii clinical trials  as defined 
upon completion of phase ii clinical trials  pfizer has the option to acquire  upon payment of million  an exclusive  worldwide license to develop and commercialize the latanoprost product for the treatment of human ophthalmic disease and conditions other than uveitis and we would be eligible to receive development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to million and double digit sales based royalties 
if pfizer does not exercise this option  we will be able to develop and commercialize the latanoprost product on our own or with a partner  with rights to pfizer intellectual property as necessary 
based upon the significant changes to the terms of the original pfizer agreement  which included i changes in the consideration payable by pfizer  ii changes in the deliverables  and iii changes in the research program  which now is solely related to the latanoprost product  we considered the restated pfizer agreement a material modification and applied the guidance of asu to this arrangement 
our deliverables under the restated pfizer agreement include conducting the research and development program for the latanoprost product through completion of phase ii the r d program and participation on a joint steering committee jsc 
we concluded that the pfizer exercise option for the worldwide exclusive license is not a deliverable of the arrangement  due to it being a substantive option and not being priced at a significant and incremental discount 
we determined that the jsc does not have standalone value from the r d program and therefore we have combined these deliverables into a single unit of accounting 
the performance period is the expected period over which the services of the combined unit are performed  and we have estimated that period to be years 
the total arrangement consideration of the restated pfizer agreement totaled million  which consisted of the million of deferred revenue on the company s balance at the effective date plus the million upfront payment 
the difference between the total arrangement consideration and the estimated selling price of the combined deliverables  or million  has been recognized as collaborative research and development revenue in the quarter ended june   the period of the modification 
to determine the estimated selling price of the combined deliverable  we applied an acceptable margin to our cost projections for the combined deliverable 
the estimated selling price of million will be recognized as collaborative research and development revenue over the expected year performance period using the proportional performance method 
the costs associated with conducting the research program for the latanoprost product will be reflected in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred 
to the extent that any subsequent payment is received from pfizer  including exercise option  milestone and sales based royalty consideration  which would occur after completion of our performance period under the restated pfizer agreement  such amount would be recognized as revenue when all the revenue criteria are met 
bausch lomb bausch lomb sells vitrasert and retisert 
our collaboration agreement with bausch lomb provides for royalties on such sales 
in june we received a million advance from bausch lomb in consideration 
table of contents of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would be payable to us 
bausch lomb retained million in fiscal  and million in fiscal of retisert royalties that otherwise would have been payable to us 
during the quarter ended june   bausch lomb retained the final portion of these royalties otherwise payable and we recorded an incremental  of royalty income  which was paid by bausch lomb 
subsequent to june   we were entitled to receive of the retisert royalties pursuant to the collaboration agreement  and retisert royalty income was million in fiscal vitrasert royalties were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal intrinsiq in january intrinsiq acquired an exclusive field of use license for nutraceutical and food science applications of biosilicon  and certain related assets  for which we received aggregate license fee payments of million through fiscal during fiscal  we received the first contractual minimum royalty payment of  subject to continuation of the license agreement  which was cancellable by intrinsiq on days advance notice  we were entitled to receive additional scheduled minimum royalty payments totaling approximately million from january through april  creditable against quarterly royalties earned  if any 
in february  we entered into a year manufacture and supply agreement  pursuant to which we leased certain equipment to intrinsiq for use in manufacturing biosilicon material  and title to the equipment passed upon our receipt of lease payments totaling  on july   we consummated an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired porous biosilicon related capital equipment and intellectual property assets of intrinsiq for  and assumed four intrinsiq employees 
as part of the transaction  intrinsiq terminated the agreements underlying its original exclusive field of use license 
the license termination will result in the recognition of collaborative research and development revenue of million in the quarter ending september   representing the total intrinsiq deferred revenue balance at june   which is classified as a current liability 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience  anticipated results and trends and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
by their nature  these estimates  judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and management evaluates them on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
it is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies discussed below 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our technology systems 

table of contents the terms of these arrangements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  granting of license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials  participating on joint research committee in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and based on the selling price of the deliverables 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of the elements and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple deliverable arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting  the estimated selling price of each unit of accounting  and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
for the year ended june   we reported million of collaborative research and development revenue 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we prospectively adopted the provisions of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after july  asu requires a vendor to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
it changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a vendor to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available 
as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  adoption of this accounting pronouncement in fiscal resulted in the recognition of revenue in connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer that became subject to the new accounting pronouncement after a material modification to the agreement occurred 
as a result of the adoption of asu  deferred revenues associated with this pfizer agreement will be recognized as revenues earlier than would otherwise have occurred 
our deliverables under the restated pfizer agreement include conducting the research and development program for the latanoprost product through completion of phase ii the r d program and participation on a joint steering committee jsc 
we concluded that the pfizer exercise option for the worldwide exclusive license is not a deliverable of the arrangement  due to it being a substantive option and not being priced at a significant and incremental discount 
we determined that the jsc does not have standalone value from the r d program and therefore we have combined these deliverables into a single unit of accounting 
the total arrangement consideration of the restated pfizer agreement totaled million  which consisted of the million of deferred revenue on our balance sheet at the effective date plus the million upfront payment 
the difference between the total arrangement consideration and the estimated selling price of the combined deliverables  or million  has been recognized as collaborative research and development revenue in the quarter ended june   the period of the modification 
to determine the estimated selling price of the combined deliverable  we applied an estimated margin to our cost projections for the combined deliverable 
a change in the estimated margin or our cost projections would directly impact the amount of revenue recognized during fiscal an increase of in our estimated selling price of the combined deliverables would have reduced revenue recognized during fiscal by approximately  
table of contents valuation of intangible assets at june   we reported million of intangible assets  which consisted of million and million of capitalized costs related to patents  intellectual property and technology rights underlying our durasert and biosilicon technology systems  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we amortize these intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which currently extend through calendar year and results in a charge to operations of approximately million per year 
we believe that the carrying value of our intangible assets will be recouped primarily through expected net cash flows from our existing collaboration agreements described under license and collaboration agreements above 
we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the asset is no longer appropriate 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following change relative to historical or projected future operating results  modification or termination of our existing collaboration agreements  changes in the expected use of the intangible assets or the strategy for the overall business  and industry or economic trends and developments 
if an impairment trigger is identified  we determine recoverability of an intangible asset by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  and the carrying value is adjusted 
estimated future undiscounted cash flows  which relate to existing contractual agreements as well as projected cash flows from future research and development collaboration agreements utilizing the underlying technology systems  require management s judgment regarding future events and probabilities 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
future adverse changes or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge with respect to some or all of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
such an impairment charge could materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
if there is a significant change in the estimation of the projected undiscounted net cash flows for the products and product candidates utilizing the durasert and biosilicon technology systems  the carrying value of the respective assets could be impaired 
we expect to have further information about whether we will advance the latanoprost product utilizing biosilicon technology into more advanced clinical trials in late fiscal  and if we do not do so  the biosilicon intangible asset could become fully impaired 

table of contents results of operations years ended june  and year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense change in fair value of derivatives interest income other expense  net total other income expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income revenues we recognized total revenue of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a million decrease in collaborative research and development revenue  partially offset by an  increase in royalty income 
collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal of million was predominantly related to the june restated pfizer agreement 
at the effective date of the restated pfizer agreement  we had million of deferred revenue from the original pfizer agreement on our balance sheet  and we received million of upfront consideration upon execution of the restated pfizer agreement 
the million balance of pfizer deferred revenue at june   after revenue recognition of million  will be recognized as revenue using the proportional performance method over the year estimated period of our performance obligations under the restated pfizer agreement 
of that total  approximately million is currently expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal was predominantly attributable to million recognized in connection with our restated alimera agreement 
the alimera revenue consisted of i the payment in full by alimera of a million conditional note plus interest in april and ii million of revenue related to recognition of up front license consideration  reimbursement of our development costs and receipt of conditional note interest payments through the december  end date of our performance obligations under the agreement 
we are entitled to receive a million milestone payment from alimera within days following an fda approval of iluvien for dme 
however  absent an fda approval of iluvien for dme during fiscal  we currently expect to record an insignificant amount of collaborative research and development revenue attributable to the restated alimera agreement in fiscal for fiscal  we earned million of retisert royalties 
for fiscal  we recognized  in retisert royalty income and million of retisert royalties otherwise payable to us was retained by bausch 
table of contents lomb as the result of a advance payment from bausch lomb  thereby completing an advance royalty agreement 
retisert royalty income for fiscal represented a decrease compared to the aggregate of fiscal royalty income and amounts retained by bausch lomb 
for fiscal  we expect retisert royalty income to continue its historical downward trend 
research and development research and development decreased by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a federal therapeutic discovery grant  partially offset by a small increase in research and development costs 
we may significantly increase our research and development expense in fiscal  primarily dependent upon whether we initiate clinical trials and other product development activities that we fund internally 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation and professional fees 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented income of million for fiscal compared to expense of  for fiscal detachable warrants issued in share offerings denominated in a were recorded as derivative liabilities  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivatives for fiscal  determined using the black scholes valuation model  was predominantly due to the expiration of approximately million  or  of the a denominated warrants during the year 
the corresponding net expense in fiscal was primarily due to a substantial increase in the market price of our shares in fiscal resulting in a smaller spread between the market price and the us equivalent exercise prices of the warrants  partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average remaining life of the underlying warrants during the period 
we are required to re value these warrants at each subsequent balance sheet date  and changes in their fair values will result in adjustments to our recorded derivative liabilities  at june  and a corresponding income or expense in our statement of operations 
although fluctuations in the fair value of the warrants will continue to impact our future quarterly and annual operating results until the last to expire of these warrants in july  we expect the significantly lower number of outstanding warrants and short remaining duration to result in less significant income and expense fluctuations as compared to the prior two years 
income tax expense benefit income tax benefit of  in fiscal compares to  of income tax expense for fiscal  primarily attributable to a net reduction of deferred tax liabilities 

table of contents years ended june  and year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income change in fair value of derivatives interest income other expense income  net total other expense income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss revenues revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal in each fiscal year  revenues were almost entirely attributable to our collaboration agreement with alimera  consisting of i the portion of the upfront license consideration that we recognized in the given year  and ii the aggregate of conditional note payments and reimbursement of our development costs received from alimera that we recognized in the given fiscal year 
for fiscal  the alimera related revenues included payment in full by alimera of the million conditional note plus interest 
during fiscal  million of retisert royalties otherwise payable were retained by bausch lomb  thereby completing the advance royalty agreement  and  were recorded as royalty income compared to million retained by bausch lomb in fiscal and recorded as royalty income 
the fiscal total of royalty income and amounts otherwise payable of approximately million compared to approximately million of royalties otherwise payable for fiscal  a decrease of 
research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to an approximate million reduction of uk based research and development costs  primarily related to third party costs of our brachysil clinical program and third party biosilicon manufacturing development for the period prior to consummation of our intrinsiq supply agreement 
approximately  of the total decrease was attributable to the relative strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling 
general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal this net decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors the absence of a million provision for losses in fiscal on a note receivable  
table of contents the elimination of approximately  of legal fees and consulting services incurred in fiscal directly related to the june reincorporation  an approximate  reduction in us salaries and benefits  primarily related to fiscal salary and severance agreement costs of a former executive officer  partially offset by an approximate  increase in stock based compensation 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented an expense of  for fiscal compared to income of  for fiscal  primarily due to a net increase in the market price of our shares in fiscal resulting in a smaller spread between the market price and the us equivalent exercise prices of the warrants compared to a net decrease in the market price of our shares in fiscal interest income interest income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  primarily due to sharply lower weighted average interest rates earned on money market funds 
other expense income other expense  net of  for fiscal compares to other income of  for fiscal this change was primarily attributable to the absence in fiscal of foreign exchange gains recognized in fiscal income tax expense benefit income tax expense of  in fiscal compares to  of income tax benefit for fiscal the net change was primarily attributable to an approximate  decrease of foreign research and development tax credits earned by our uk subsidiary and an approximate  increase in us federal alternative minimum taxes resulting from payment of the alimera conditional note 
inflation and seasonality our management believes inflation has not had a material impact on our operations or financial condition and that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences 
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
unless otherwise disclosed below  we believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we adopted asu for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after july  adoption of this guidance had a material impact on our fiscal consolidated financial statements as a result of a materially modified research and collaboration agreement with pfizer 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income that will require us to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two 
table of contents separate  but consecutive statements 
there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current gaap 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
it is applicable to our fiscal quarter beginning july  we have not yet determined which method we will elect to present comprehensive income under the new standard 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal to  we financed our operations primarily from license fees  research and development funding and contingent cash payments from our collaboration partners and  to a lesser degree  from a january registered direct offering of our equity securities 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
our cash equivalents are invested in institutional money market funds and our marketable securities are invested in investment grade corporate debt  government agency securities and commercial paper with maturities at june  ranging from one to nine months 
with the exception of fiscal  we have incurred operating losses since inception and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis at least until such time as one or more of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval and achieves sufficient sales 
we believe we can fund our operations as currently conducted into at least calendar year whether we will require  or desire  to raise additional capital will be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to the timely development and regulatory approval and successful commercialization of iluvien and receipt of milestone  royalty and other payments  the scope and extent of our internally funded operations and programs  including the clinical trials for the latanoprost product and the posterior uveitis insert  any new product candidates and any new business opportunities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements for products and product candidates for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the success of our products and product candidates  including the timing and costs of regulatory approvals and the commercial success of approved products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing any patent claims  and changes in our operating plan  including the pursuit of any new business opportunities  which may affect our need for capital 
absent adequate levels of funding from new and existing collaboration agreements and or financing transactions  management currently believes that our cash position thereafter depends significantly on approval of iluvien for dme by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities and the initiation and success of marketing of iluvien for dme 
however  there is no assurance that the fda or other regulatory authorities will approve iluvien for dme or that it will achieve market acceptance even if it is approved 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the state of the economy and the financial and credit markets at the time we seek additional financing may make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms  including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  postpone the pursuit of product candidates and new business opportunities  or otherwise reduce our cash requirements
