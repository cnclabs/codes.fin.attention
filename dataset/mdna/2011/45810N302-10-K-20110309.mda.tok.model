overview we manage highly specialized outpatient centers in emerging  technology based  niche medical markets 
we currently operate in two healthcare sectors  fertility care and vein treatment 
we support our operations with an established and extensive infrastructure of clinical and business resources 
each of our operating divisions is presented as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes 
the attain fertility centers division is comprised of contracted fertility centers  located in major markets across the united states 
each contracted center is composed of a multi physician practice with most offering multiple clinical locations in their service area 
this division provides an array of services to contracted fertility centers ranging from consumer marketing services to complete practice management services 
the strategy of the attain fertility centers division is to support the long term growth of contracted centers by attracting and retaining new patients  expanding market share  and for our partner practices those that we provide the full range of management service  we enable superior clinical and patient care  and increase the operational efficiency of the fertility center

adding interventional radiology allows this vein clinic to offer patients more high value and complex vascular procedures including uterine fibroid embolization  fallopian tube recanalization as well as procedures for varicoceles and pelvic congestion  among others 
on december   we acquired the rights to supply a complete range of business  marketing and facility services to three new partner fertility centers in the western united states  the idaho center for reproductive medicine  the nevada center for reproductive medicine and the utah fertility center  based in boise  idaho  reno  nevada and prove  utah respectively

from june through march  our annual and our periodic interim securities and exchange commission reports were the subject of a standard comment and review process by the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities and exchange commission 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our attain ivf refund program s multiple element revenue arrangements is complex and management s interpretation of the applicable authoritative literature related to the timing of the recognition of the fair value of revenues for the non refundable portion of the attain ivf refund program fees differed from that of the securities and exchange commission  which caused us to re evaluate our revenue recognition policies 
as a result  we restated our prior financial statements for the correction of an error with respect to the timing of revenue recognition for our attain ivf refund program within our attain fertility centers division 
our previous revenue recognition policy had generally recognized the non refundable patient fees generally of the contract amount as revenues upon the completion of the first treatment cycle 
we now recognize the non refundable fees based on the relationship of the fair value of each treatment to the total fair value of the treatment package available to each patient 
we also recognize a warranty reserve representing the estimated cost of services to be provided in the event a qualified patient miscarries  as well as a reserve for potential refunds should a patient elect to discontinue participation in the program prior to full treatment 
this restatement does not impact our cash flows from operations or the ultimate profits from our attain ivf refund program  only the timing of the revenue recognition for the non refundable portion of the attain ivf refund program fees paid by patients

significant accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  including our significant accounting policies  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of net revenues and accounts receivable and reserves for estimated refunds and subsequent medical costs due to pregnancy losses in our attain ivf programs 
uncollectible reserve amounts are determined based on historical collection performance data and are reviewed and adjusted monthly as necessary 
we make periodic estimates for pregnancy loss based upon relevant company specific data

this increase was driven by growth of from our attain fertility centers division  partially offset by a slight decline from our vein clinics segment due to start up costs associated with new clinic openings 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   total revenues of million increased approximately million  or  from the same period in approximately million of this increase was generated by our vein clinics division and million from our attain fertility centers division 
two new vein clinics opened during the first quarter of accounted for million of our vein clinics division s increase  with the remaining increase attributed to existing clinics 
for the year ended december   contribution increased from million in the comparable period of  to million in  or an increase of  driven by growth in both our attain fertility centers and vein clinics divisions 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below attain fertility centers our attain fertility centers segment is comprised primarily of our partner fertility centers  which represent the provider aspect of the fertility market  and our attain ivf programs  which are directed at the consumer portion of the market 
revenues partner fertility centers in providing clinical care to patients  each of our partner fertility centers generates patient revenues which we do not report in our consolidated financial statements 
although we do not consolidate the partner fertility center practice financials with our own  these financials do directly affect our revenues 
the components of our revenues from most of the partner fertility centers are a base service fee calculated as a percentage of patient revenues as reported by the partner fertility center this percentage generally varies from down to depending on the agreement and the level of patient revenues  cost of services equal to reimbursement for the expenses which we advanced to the partner fertility center during the month representing substantially all of the expenses incurred by the center  except physician compensation  and our additional fees which represent our share of the net income of the partner fertility center which varies from to or a fixed amount depending on the underlying center  subject to limits in some circumstances 
our revenues from our fertility centers of illinois  sc fci partner fertility center are not based on this three part structure 
rather  effective as of november   our revenues from fci are generally equal to the operating expenses associated with managing fci s medical practice plus of such expenses 
our revenues from fci prior to november  were  pursuant to our current partner agreement with fci  set at a fixed annual amount paid monthly 
in addition to these revenues generated from our fertility centers  we often receive miscellaneous other revenues related to providing non medical services to medical practices 
from the total of our revenues  we subtract the annual amortization of our business service rights under most agreements  which are the rights to provide business services to each of the centers 
during  revenue from our partner fertility centers increased by million  or  relative to the same period in the prior year 
this increase was the result of a million rise in same center revenues as well as million of incremental revenues from the addition of new partner contracts in the increased revenue from same centers was due in part to the increased number of physicians practicing at these locations as well as facility fees earned from affiliated physicians who utilized our clinical facilities 
during  our partner fertility center revenues increased by million  or  relative to the same period in the prior year 
this increase was the result of a million rise in same center revenues as well as million of incremental revenues from the addition of new partner contracts 
this increase is net of the reduction in business at one of our top fertility centers in the midwest as a result of termination of a contract with one of the center s third party payors  as well as a slight moderation in demand that we believe is attributable to the prolonged recession the table below illustrates the components of the attain fertility centers revenues in relation to the partner fertility center practice financials for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  partner fertility center financials a patient revenue b cost of services c base service fee d practice contribution a b c e additional service fee f contribution retained by physician partners d e integramed financials g integramed gross revenue b c e h amortization of business service rights i other revenue j integramed fertility services revenue g h i k cost of services division overhead other contractual cost of service l contribution of integramed fertility centers j k i other revenue includes administrative fees we receive from artic  the captive insurance company as well as other miscellaneous fees 
the company s revenue generated from the business services provided to the physician partner clinics line g is comprised of the three fee components  the cost of service fee line b  the base service fee line c and the additional service fee line e 
the revenue recorded by our physician partner clinics line a is derived from providing medical services to patients 
as the exclusive service provider to these clinics  the company supplies the clinics with all resources necessary for the physicians to provide these medical services 
in return  the company receives reimbursement for the cost of these resources line b plus two additional fees lines c and e which are based on the performance of specific operations under the service agreement 
the residual financial results of the partner physician s business patient revenue  line a  less costs and fees of the business line f  are a right of the partner physicians the business owners  and as such are not consolidated in the financial results of the company

new patients visits are an indicator of initial patient interest in fertility treatment and ivf cases completed are an indicator of billable charges 
ivf cases completed in the fourth quarter of each year are typically lower  as many patients do not wish to undergo the ivf procedure during the year end holiday season 
contributing to the lower number of ivf cases completed are voluntary laboratory closures at year end as several of our labs in order to undergo normal maintenance

any non refundable portion of these fees is recognized as revenue  based on the relative fair value of each treatment cycle completed relative to the total fair value of the contracted treatment package available to the patient 
the refundable portion of the program contract amount is recognized as revenue when the patient becomes pregnant 
at the time of pregnancy  we establish a reserve for future medical costs should the patient miscarry and require additional contracted treatment cycles 
the two main factors that impact attain ivf refund program financial performance are the number of patients enrolled and receiving treatment  and clinical pregnancy rates 
patients enrolled in our attain ivf multi cycle program pay us a single fee  which is slightly less than the average cost of two fresh ivf cycles  in return for up to four treatment cycles consisting of two fresh ivf cycles and two frozen embryo transfers 
with respect to our attain ivf multi cycle program  we recognize a pro rata share of the contract amount as revenue as each treatment cycle is completed 
the refundable portion of the program contract amount is recognized as revenue when the patient becomes pregnant 
under such revenue recognition methodology  we never recognize more revenue than the potential refundable amount under the program 
at the time of pregnancy  we establish a reserve for future medical costs should the patient miscarry and require additional contracted treatment cycles 
the main factors that impacts attain ivf multi cycle program financial performance is the number of patients enrolled and receiving treatment as well as clinical outcomes 
revenues from our attain ivf programs increased by million  or  for the year ended december   versus the same period in the prior year 
this growth was fueled primarily by the expansion of our multi cycle product offering during fiscal which helped drive enrollments and pregnancies in our attain ivf programs to increases of and  respectively  during versus the prior year 
revenues from our attain ivf programs grew  or million  for the year ended december  versus the same period in the prior year 
during the second quarter of  the loss of a primary third party lender that provided financing programs for many attain ivf patients and a general tightening of credit standards and higher interest rates caused a decline in new patient enrollments that adversely affected the program 
contribution contribution from our attain fertility centers division for the year ended december  rose million or to million versus million in the year earlier period 
this increase is comprised of additional contribution of million from our partner fertility centers resulting from higher management fees associated with the underlying growth of those clinics  an additional million of contribution from our attain ivf programs resulting from the revenue additions described above  less additional division specific overhead costs of million primarily related to marketing initiatives and additional management infrastructure 
contribution from our attain fertility centers division for the year ended december  rose million  or to million from million in the year earlier period 
this increase was comprised of additional contribution of million from our partner fertility centers  of which million was attributable to new partner centers and million was attributable to legacy centers 
contribution from our attain ivf programs for the year ended december  was essentially even with that of the prior year due to previously discussed macro economic conditions which impacted the ability of many patients to secure the adequate financing required for treatment 
division level overhead costs also increased million during the twelve months ended december  versus  which was primarily comprised of additional management and marketing related initiatives 
vein clinics segment revenues revenues within our vein clinics segment are generated from direct billings to patients or their insurer for vein disease treatment services and these revenues are consolidated directly into our financials 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  up  or million from during  we opened new vein clinic locations in columbia and chevy chase  maryland  quantico  va  glastonbury greenwich  ct  chapel hill  nc  crocker park  oh  and trevose  pa 
these additional clinics brought our total number of vein clinics to as of december  these new vein clinics were primarily opened in the later part of and accounted for million of the increase in division revenue 
the remaining million increase was generated from existing clinics and resulted from increased marketing  operational and service enhancement offerings 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  up  or million from during  we opened new vein clinic locations in cincinnati and cleveland  marking our entry into the state of ohio and these two markets 
these additional clinics brought our total number of vein clinics to the two new vein clinics opened in early accounted for million of our vein clinics division s revenue increase  the five clinics opened throughout accounted for million of the increase with the remaining million generated by legacy clinics 
contribution contribution for the year ended december  was million  a decline of million from the prior year and is attributable to the start up costs associated with our new clinic expansion program which opened new clinics in  versus in contribution from our legacy clinics  those open one year or more  grew by million  or for the year ended december  versus the prior year 
for  contribution of million  rose million compared to a contribution of million for the year ended december  the improved performance for is largely attributable to the additional operational and marketing infrastructure put in place during the infrastructure improvements were initiated after the purchase of the vein clinics division during the third quarter of  and allowed the division to initiate ongoing marketing efforts resulting in increased patient volumes as well as to establish a management structure which allowed for greater operational control and a platform for new clinic expansion 
we continue to target the opening of additional new vein clinics in locations across the united states during and future years 
the pace of these openings is dependent upon our ability to identify and develop appropriate site locations for clinics which comprise both adequate reimbursement rates and patient demographics  and to recruit qualified physicians to staff those sites 
to address these challenges we have assembled a new clinic task force who are focused on the expansion of our clinical footprint across the united states 
first leg starts  which are a billable procedure  and a measure of our ability to attract and convert new patients  rose and in the twelve months ended december  versus  and versus  respectively 
growth rates for were moderated in part due to the timing of new clinic openings in which were heavily weighted towards the end of the calendar year

general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase from the million recognized in the prior year 
the increased general and administrative expenses in is attributable to higher marketing and infrastructure activities designed to provide operational support to our two growing business segments 
we measure our performance in part by relating general and administrative expenses to operating contribution 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were of contribution compared to a ratio of for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to enhanced marketing spend 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in and million in for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were of contribution as compared to in we continue to actively manage general and administrative expenses in an effort to leverage our shared services group and extract economies of scale as those opportunities arise 
interest net interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
the reduction in net interest expense for the years presented is the result of scheduled debt repayments which reduced our outstanding loan balances 
subject to interest rate fluctuations and any changes to our credit arrangements  we anticipate interest expense to decrease gradually in the coming quarters as scheduled debt repayments reduce our outstanding principal balances 
income tax provision our provision for income tax was approximately million  million and million for the three years ended december   and respectively  or  and of pre tax income  respectively 
our effective tax rates for all years reflect provisions for both federal and state income taxes 
effective january   we adopted asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in income taxes 
the adoption of this interpretation has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states 
for federal income tax purposes  our tax year remains open for examination by the tax authorities 
federal income tax returns through have been examined by the internal revenue service 
for state tax purposes  our through tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities mainly because we are currently under examination by the states of new york and florida 
we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements due to these examinations 
off balance sheet arrangements current accounting guidance addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on accounting for variable interest entities vie 
the new accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods after january  both new accounting guidance requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires consolidation if the enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  and is the primary beneficiary or obligor of the vie 
as of december   through the acquisition of vein clinics of america  inc  we have interests in the individual vein clinics  where we are the primary beneficiary and obligor of their financial results our contract provides for us to receive any excess or deficit profits from the vein clinics 
as such we have consolidated these vein clinic operations in our consolidated financial statements 
since we do not have any financial interest in the individual fertility centers and we are not the primary beneficiary or obligor of their financial results our contracts provide for the physician owners of the clinics to receive any excess or deficit profits  we do not consolidate the results of the fertility centers in our accounts 
also  since we do not have a controlling interest in the captive insurance provider and we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not consolidate the results of the captive insurance company in our accounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  we had a working capital of approximately million  at december  attain ivf deferred revenue and other patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles and are an indication of future revenues 
these deposits totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the change in deposit balances are a direct result of patient enrollment  and through put  in our treatment programs 
these deposits are a significant source of cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
these funds are not restricted and the cash balances are included in our cash and cash equivalents 
in may   we entered into a syndicated amended and restated financing arrangement with bank of america  td bank and webster bank and secured a million three year revolving credit facility amounts available to be borrowed are based on eligible patient receivables and as of december   approximately million of the million line of credit was available and a million three year term loan of which approximately million was outstanding at the date of closing 
both the term loan and the revolving credit facility mature in may interest on the term loan and revolving loans are payable based on a tiered pricing structure related to a defined leverage ratio 
commitment fees on unused portions of the revolving credit facility are also payable based on a tiered pricing structure tied to the same defined leverage ratio 
we continuously review our credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary 
during the third quarter of we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to help manage interest rate risk 
this swap will mature in the third quarter of  at which time we will re evaluate our options for managing interest rate risk 
as of december   we were not in compliance with one of the required financial covenants in our credit facility  for which we have received a waiver from our lenders 
on march   we amended our credit facility to modify i the definition of unfunded capital expenditures and ii the covenant related to minimum consolidated ebitda  for the fiscal quarter ended december  and each fiscal quarter through march  to million on a trailing four quarters basis and for each quarter ending june  and thereafter to million 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  which raised approximately million of net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
the stated use of proceeds for this new capital was to assist with the addition of new partner fertility centers  accelerate the pace of new vein clinic openings in  and for general working capital and other corporate purposes 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements 
however  we do anticipate upcoming capital expenditures during the normal course of business which we will be able to finance from our operating cash flows 
these expenditures are primarily related to medical equipment  information system infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
we believe that working capital  specifically cash and cash equivalents  remains at adequate levels to fund our operations and our commitments for fixed asset acquisitions 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands notes payable capital lease obligations interest on debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years in thousands unused lines of credit we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to partner centers in our attain fertility centers division that are not included in the above table 
a significant portion of these commitments relate to our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the these medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf  as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur monthly 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  we reduce the cash credit for center expenses that we have incurred on behalf of the practice  we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the partner revenues  we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the partner earnings  and we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physician s undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the partner accounts receivables 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flows from operations  the collection of prior months receivables and deposits from patients in advance of treatment 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing revolving line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the partner for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practices 
we have no other funding commitments to the partner centers 
recent issued accounting guidance fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu   fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends subtopic asu enhances disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
certain provisions of asu are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  and others for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has adopted the relevant provisions of asu and has incorporated new disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf replacement for issue asc issue will change the accounting for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue will enable entities to separately account for individual deliverables for many more revenue arrangements 
by removing the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables  the eitf expects the recognition of revenue to more closely align with the economics of certain revenue arrangements 
issue applies to all deliverables in contractual arrangements in all industries in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities  except when some or all deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement are within the scope of other  more specific sections of the codification and other sections of asc on revenue recognition 
specifically  issue addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
it also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting  when applicable 
issue requires a vendor to evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
this evaluation must be performed at the inception of an arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
it is our opinion that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
issue must be applied prospectively to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our interest income and expense items are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
we are currently subject to interest rate risk associated with our credit facilities as well as our short term investments and certain advances to our partner fertility centers  some of which are tied to either short term interest rates  libor or the prime rate 
as of december   we do not believe that a one percent change in market level interest rates would have a material impact our pre tax income
