critical accounting policies 
this section discusses the accounting policies i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
overview we are an aerospace industry leader in which we design and manufacture aircraft instrumentation and sensor systems 
these products are used for both primary flight data as well as for standby purposes in cockpits where electronic displays are used for primary flight data 
as cockpit panel space becomes more valuable in the new age of glass displays  we have maintained a strong position with original equipment manufacturers oem as a premier supplier of quality aircraft instrumentation in both the military and commercial aircraft marketplace 
this allows us to offer a fully integrated avionics package  from air data collection products to display and backup instrumentation which reduces the number of suppliers required on an aircraft 
our unique capabilities in air data collection products continue to expand with the development of a flush port air data system for a leading international aircraft manufacturer for use on a new unmanned combat air vehicle and level a certification of a stall warning transmitter for a major us manufacturer of business and military aircraft 
building on our expertise with mechanical instrumentation  we have successfully developed and marketed digital instrumentation and displays for both primary flight data systems as well as standby redundant systems to complement our mechanical product line 
in addition  we have made considerable progress in the development of electronic air data collection instrumentation for use in military and commercial aircraft applications 
our current market focus has been  and will continue to be  the design  development and supply of electronic and mechanical primary and standby flight control systems components and instruments 
these include altimeters  airspeed indicators  angle of attack indicators  stall warning systems  air data measurement systems and flight display systems 
these products are critical to aircraft operation  performance and safety 
in conjunction with our development and production activities  aerosonic has developed expertise in the build  test and validation of critical test equipment  including environmental stress screening chambers and wind tunnels 
aerosonic is expanding that knowledge to offer customers the ability to order turnkey solutions for their test needs 
the trend in the aerospace industry continues toward digital cockpits and away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation 
during fiscal year  we continued to make progress in our ability to design and manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems 
we have maintained and strengthened our commitment to research and development to further enhance our product line as we anticipate continued movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry 
we plan to position ourselves such that we have the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while we believe that this strategy will  over time  strengthen our position in the aerospace industry  we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy 
a significant amount of our business relates to the sale of our products to united states us and foreign military programs 
as a consequence  our sales can fluctuate materially  either favorably or unfavorably  depending upon the level of government spending on those military programs which are the focus of our manufacturing efforts 
while we have been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  sudden reductions in government spending or delays in the government contract award process could have a material unfavorable effect on our current and future military sales and related cash flows 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the us government contract award or budget process  we expect that the majority of the military programs that we supply will be sustained at current or near current levels 
additionally  us government procurement offices often require long periods of time to issue requests for proposals and to negotiate contracts 
such lengthy contract cycle times may delay the award of certain anticipated contracts of significant value to the company 
continued delays of such contract awards may have a significant adverse effect on the financial results of the company 
similarly  changes in the commercial sector of the aerospace industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future business 
while we have historically invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase our revenue in the aerospace industry 
with the recent economic conditions  several of our commercial customers continue to operate with reduced operations and manufacturing 
while this may be offset by additional increases in aftermarket support  it is likely that our business will continue to be negatively affected until the economy recovers and our customers resume prior levels of production and growth 
recently  we are finding that with the negative effects of the ongoing recession  the general aviation and business jet markets may take longer to recover than previously believed 
for example  certain key commercial customers are slowing their operations and are pushing contractual delivery dates into the future by six to eighteen months 
continued movements into the future of such customer deliveries may have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 
recognizing the risks and challenges of the current environment in both our military and commercial markets  we continue to closely analyze our operations and our cost structure for opportunities to enhance our financial performance in the face of the difficult economic environment 
as a result of these analyses  we recently announced the closure of our virginia repair center and the transition of its business into our florida facility 
we will continue to evaluate our operations and implement actions we deem appropriate to counter the near term challenges in our markets while preserving our ability to be responsive to our customers as the economy improves 
results of operations our senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives 
we review information on the financial performance of the operations  new business opportunities  customer relationships and initiatives  ir d activities  human resources  manufacturing effectiveness  cost reduction activities  as well as other subjects 
we compare performance against budget  against prior comparable periods and against our most recent internal forecasts 
we believe overall prospects for our financial performance to be very good over the long term  but expect our operations to remain challenging during the short term 
our backlog declined from prior year levels due to the worldwide slow economy that caused most aircraft manufacturers to scale back production in the near term 
our financial performance in fiscal year was adversely affected by the slower economy generally and in the aerospace industry in particular that contributed to reduced sales as well as by our continued investment in the development of new products 
the virginia property held for sale uses cash for continued maintenance and debt servicing without contributing to our operations  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
our ability to enhance gross profit and operating results will require that we continuously improve throughput in our manufacturing processes while reducing costs and inefficiencies in our operations through better resource management 
we are well engaged in implementing lean manufacturing principles  supported by training programs  to further develop a consistent  disciplined  and innovative engineering and production culture 
we complement these initiatives with a marketing and sales strategy that builds on our market presence and core competencies in sensor  air data computation  and display technologies 
we believe that the investments that the company has been making  and will continue to make in support of our customers  will pay off strongly as our markets continue their recovery 
greatly improved operating metrics  as well as direct customer feedback with respect to quality and delivery performance  is resulting in the company being far better positioned to win new business 
our improved systems  focused value stream teams  and growing capabilities should enable us to far more reliably fulfill commitments to our customers  suppliers  and shareholders 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales were  during fiscal year  a decrease of  or  compared to  for fiscal year during fiscal year  our sales volume decreased from the prior year by approximately million on reduced demand for air data products  sensing products  spares  electronic display instruments and air data test equipment  offset by approximately million of increased sales volume of instrumentation and million of repairs and other sales 
gross profit for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit in fiscal year  as a percent of sales  reflects a the effects of a significantly higher mix of mechanical products that produce lower gross margins versus the higher sales of transmitter products  sensor products and spares in the prior year  b lean investment activities  and c contract loss provisions of approximately  on three customer funded development contracts 
these customer funded programs generating the contract loss provisions are nearing their final stages of development and entering the qualification testing stage 
we view these costs as investments in technology and capabilities that we expect to benefit future business opportunities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased  or  compared to fiscal year the net increase was primarily due to a increases in ir d costs  offset by b decreases in legal and consulting expenses 
interest expense  net increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  in large part because of interest expense relating to the investors notes payable as defined below and an increased debt balance 
gains from casualty of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  relate to the insurance claim from our august  fire 
we reported a loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year in the amount of  representing a accelerated accretion expense relating to the portion of the notes payables repaid early and b costs relating to the extinguishment of debt with our prior bank 
income tax expense was  in fiscal year compared to a tax benefit of  for fiscal year fiscal year was favorably impacted by the  reversal of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year  the effects of which were partly offset by significantly increased profitability generated by operations in fiscal year for fiscal year  our net income was approximately  or basic and diluted income per share  compared to net income of approximately  or basic and diluted income per share for the year ended january  the decrease in net income for fiscal year was driven by the decreased sales volume combined with lower gross margin performance  while fiscal year significantly benefitted from the reversal of the  tax valuation allowance 
for fiscal year  basic and diluted income per share included approximately and  respectively  that was attributable to the reversal of the tax valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of capital have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
as of january   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to approximately as of january  in addition  as of january   we had  available under the credit facility described below 
our cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year  an increase in cash provided of  compared to cash used of  for fiscal year this net increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to increases in cash provided by operating activities of  from decreased repayments of customer advances in fiscal year  compared to repayments of customer advances in fiscal year  from an increase to the contract loss provision   from increased accrual of expenses and other liabilities in fiscal year compared to expense accrual levels in fiscal year and  from a noncash provision for income taxes for fiscal year compared to the provision for income taxes for fiscal year  primarily offset by increases in cash used in operating activities of  from decreased operating net income in fiscal year compared to operating net income in fiscal year and  from increased prepayment of expenses and other current assets in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our cash used in investing activities decreased  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to purchases of  in capital improvements and equipment during fiscal year compared to purchases of  of capital improvements and equipment during fiscal year related primarily to the replacement of fixed assets lost in the august fire 
our cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was  compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year of  the change was attributable to  of net proceeds from our refinancing of the wachovia bank debt facilities with our m i bank credit facility  as well as an additional  of proceeds from the investors notes payable described below  both during fiscal year we paid down the notes payable during fiscal year in the amount of  and fully paid the remaining balance of the investors notes payable on march  our days sales in accounts receivable unfavorably increased to days at january   up from days at january   due in large part to our customers lengthening their payment cycles 
through cash management and purchasing practices  our outstanding balances with production suppliers favorably improved as days purchases in accounts payable decreased to days at january   down from days at january  we continue to be challenged to maintain favorable payment terms with certain suppliers 
we continue to deal with residual production issues from the impact of the august  fire 
during fiscal year  we repaid the remaining  in customer advances outstanding at january   which those customers made to us to accommodate our financial circumstances following the fire 
we have not yet sold the earlysville  virginia facility  although active marketing efforts are continuing 
because of these circumstances and the decline in our income compared fiscal year  we continue to experience liquidity constraints 
we will depend on our ability to achieve expected operating results to maintain sufficient liquidity to i satisfy working capital requirements  ii fulfill necessary capital spending  and iii meet our debt obligations in fiscal year and beyond 
our failure to successfully achieve these results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations and could require us to implement curative measures  including raising capital  deferring planned capital expenditures  reductions in force  further facility consolidation  reducing discretionary spending  and selling assets 
m i bank credit facility on april   we entered into a loan agreement the loan agreement with m i bank with a maximum amount of credit facilities available to us of  collectively  the credit facility 
the loan agreement provides for a a  revolving line of credit the revolving credit line note used for working capital  b a  first real estate mortgage loan the real estate mortgage note used to refinance an existing loan related to our clearwater  florida facility  c a  term loan the equipment term note and together with the real estate mortgage note  the bank notes used to refinance an existing loan relating to the earlysville  virginia property and for working capital and capital expenditure needs  and d a  equipment line of credit the equipment credit line note and together with the revolving credit line note  the credit line notes used to purchase equipment for use in our business 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
actual amounts available under the revolving line note are determined by a defined borrowing base consisting primarily of our eligible receivables and inventory 
as of january   we had  available for advances under the revolving line note 
we are in discussions with our lender to extend the revolving credit note  which is scheduled to mature on june  the interest rate on the revolving credit line note is one month libor plus basis points with a floor 
the real estate mortgage note has a three year term  a year amortization period and the interest rate is one month libor plus basis points with a floor 
the equipment term note has a three year term  a five year amortization period and the interest rate is one month libor plus basis points with a floor 
the equipment credit line note has a three year term  a five year amortization period  and the interest rate is one month libor basis points with a floor 
we used proceeds from the credit facility  in part  to fully satisfy outstanding debt and fees owed to wachovia bank  our former lender  of  we will use available funds received and financing available under the credit facility for new product development  working capital  and capital expenditure needs 
our loan agreement contains financial and other restrictive covenants which required that as of january   we maintain i on a consolidated basis  total stockholders equity  defined as the value of total assets less total liabilities  equal to at least  which increases on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to ninety percent of our net income calculated on a consolidated basis for the quarter  ii on a consolidated basis  a ratio of funded debt  defined as all outstanding liabilities for borrowed money and other interest bearing liabilities  including current and long term debt  less the non current portion of subordinated liabilities  defined as liabilities subordinated to our obligations to the lender in a manner acceptable to the lender in its sole discretion  to ebitda not exceeding  and iii on a consolidated basis  a fixed charge coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of a the sum of ebitda plus lease expense and rent expense  minus income tax  minus dividends  withdrawals  and other distributions  to b the sum of cash interest expense  lease expense  rent expense  scheduled principal amortization actually paid to the lender during the measuring period excluding any principal payments under the revolving credit line note and the investors notes payable  and scheduled payments on capitalized lease obligations during the measuring period  of at least we calculate these covenants at the end of each quarterly reporting period for which the lender requires financial statements 
for the period measured as of january   we did not comply with the funded debt to ebitda covenant in the credit facility 
on april   the lender waived our non compliance with the funded debt to editda covenant 
on april   pursuant to a joint amendment to loan agreement and revolving line of credit note  the lender amended the funded debt to ebitda covenant to for the balance of fiscal year the lender also extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line note to june  although the lender waived our compliance with this covenant and amended the credit facility  there is no assurance that the lender will waive compliance or amend the credit facility in future periods  if such a waiver or amendment is needed 
we are in discussions with the lender to further extend the maturity of the revolving credit line note for another year  but there is no assurance that the lender will do so 
on october   we borrowed an additional  on the equipment credit line note  which replenished cash that we used to purchase and construct equipment over the months before that date 
we used this borrowed cash to accelerate repayment of the investors notes payable  as described below 
investors notes payable on may   we entered into separate unsecured loans the notes payable with three separate private investors collectively  the investors bruce j 
stone  redmond family investments  lllp and martin l 
schaffel 
each note payable contained a drawdown provision allowing us to borrow up to an aggregate of  documentation for the notes payable provided for issuance of warrants with an exercise price of per warrant issued at the rate of one warrant for every four dollars loaned to us and common shares at the rate of one share for every ten dollars loaned to us 
additionally  any amounts borrowed are subject to interest per annum  payable monthly 
on may   we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of  under the notes payable 
this transaction resulted in issuance of  warrants to the investors that are exercisable until the warrants expire on april   as well as  common shares 
this aggregate amount borrowed of  was initially payable in full under each of the three notes on or before april  the warrants and common shares are recorded as a separate component of interest and are being accreted into the loan balance over the term of the loan 
on february   we borrowed an additional  from the investors under the notes payable and entered into amendments to the notes payable 
these modifications a extended the maturity date of the subordinated notes for a period of one year from april  to april   b removed our obligation to issue shares of our common stock on each cash drawdown made on or after february   c revised the ratio of common shares underlying warrants issuable per each of principal amount borrowed from 
shares per of principal amount to 
shares per of principal amount with respect to cash drawdowns made on or after february   and d deleted certain negative covenants relating to the issuance of securities 
the warrant modifications a extended the expiration date of any warrants issued prior to february  for a period of five years from april  to april   b extended the expiration date of any warrants issued on or after february  from april  to the sixth anniversary date of the issuance of the warrant certificate  and c revised the purchase price for any warrants issued on or after february  from per share to a price equal to of the volume weighted average of the selling price of our common stock on february  and for the trading days prior to february   or per share 
the related warrants  issued to the investors pursuant to the additional  loan are exercisable at any time before the warrants expire on february  the warrants and common shares issued under the notes payable are recorded as a separate component of interest and are being accreted into the loan balances over the term of the loans 
for the fiscal years ended and  we recognized accretion of  and  respectively  presented as additional interest expense 
in addition  as a result of early repayments to the investors during fiscal year  we recognized accelerated interest accretion expense in the amount of  which is reported as loss on extinguishment of debt 
on march   we completed repayment of the notes payable in full satisfaction of the remaining debt outstanding of  as of january  working capital and capital expenditures our working capital at january  was  compared to  at january  an increase in working capital of  as of january  relates primarily to the reclassification of long term debt from current liabilities to non current liabilities due to the refinancing of our bank debt with wachovia bank by m i bank 
additionally  increases to accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets in the amount of  and  respectively  contributed to the increase 
these favorable working capital variances are offset in part by an unfavorable working capital variance associated with an increase in accrued liabilities of  the collection of our accounts receivable is the primary source of cash used to fund our operations 
our banking line of credit is used as an additional source of cash as necessary from time to time  and we sweep any excess cash back against the line of credit on a daily basis to minimize interest expense 
provided we achieve expected operating results  we believe that cash collected from our accounts receivable  as further supplemented by advances under our banking facilities  will be adequate to fund our ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of product lines and other factors 
furthermore  we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
currently  our constrained cash flow from operations prohibits us from meeting these challenges through organic growth 
our capital expenditures for fiscal year were  compared to  for fiscal year historically  our capital budget was intended to replace fixed asset equipment as needed and to take advantage of technological improvements that would improve productivity 
we replaced certain critical fixtures  environmental test chambers and testing equipment that we lost in the august  fire during fiscal years and additionally  we renovated and reconfigured our florida production facility in those years to accommodate equipment previously located in our building destroyed in the fire 
inflation and changing prices our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of key operating resources  including labor and raw materials 
substantial increases in cost of sales and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
while we are taking steps to mitigate our risk to rising prices with prudent purchasing practices and improving our inventory management techniques  there can be no assurance that future supplies of raw materials and labor will not fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control 
certain operating costs such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase at or above the general rate of inflation  and we may be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of january  contractual obligations the following table presents estimated cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of january  payments due by period less than one year to greater than one year years years to years after years total purchase commitments long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases total contractual obligations acquisitions on august  the closing date we purchased of the outstanding stock of op tech  an oregon based developer and manufacturer of cockpit glass display solutions  from optimization technologies  inc  an oregon corporation the seller 
the acquisition of op tech is consistent with our strategic plan for revenue growth into related industry markets 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method 
in connection with the acquisition  we  op tech  and the seller  along with certain holders of the seller s capital stock  entered into a share purchase agreement the spa  whereby we paid  to the seller 
the spa also provides for the seller to additionally receive i up to  payable in our common stock once we obtain certain federal certifications for op tech s products  subject to seller s delivery of a duly executed subscription agreement  which provides for the seller s receipt of such stock  and a duly executed lock up agreement  which prohibits a transfer by seller for two years from the date of issuance of such stock and ii up to  if certain sales targets  or greater are met with respect to op tech s products within three years of the closing date 
as of january   no additional consideration has been recorded  nor have the contingencies been met 
environmental matters in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents by a former owner of the property 
as a result of the initial and subsequent surveys  the remaining contamination treatment costs are estimated at  as of january  the company has capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  and costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  at this time  we cannot predict how much  if any  we will incur for more costs in fiscal year after the august  fire at our clearwater  florida facility  during a routine investigation by local environmental agencies we were cited for several violations relating to the storage  handling and disposal of normal chemicals  solvents and paints used in our production facility 
our remediation plan  to avoid future violations and the payment of the above civil penalties  was submitted and subsequently approved by the florida dep 
during the three months ended april   the company completed the construction of a materials handling building at a cost of  on june   the company received a release of said violations and civil penalties from the florida dep 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of those consolidated financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue from sales of its products when the following have occurred evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery or shipment has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for fixed price contracts  the company may recognize revenue on a units of accounting basis 
the units of accounting method requires the company to evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
the company makes that determination at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if a the delivered item s have value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
the company may also recognize its revenue under the completed contract method 
for long term  fixed price contracts meeting certain criteria  the company may elect to follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue recognition 
under this method  contract revenue is computed as that percentage of estimated total revenue that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of costs to complete 
from time to time  the company will record costs and estimated profits in excess of billings for a contract 
revisions in costs and revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined without regard to the percentage of completion 
occasionally the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
when the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments  the company will recognize revenue either under the milestone method or the units of accounting method 
the milestone method requires the company to deem all milestone payments within each contract as either substantive or non substantive 
that conclusion is determined based upon a thorough review of each contract and the company s deliverables committed to in each contract 
for substantive milestones  the company concludes that upon achievement of each milestone  the amount of the corresponding defined payment is commensurate with the effort required to achieve such milestone or the value of the delivered item 
the payment associated with each milestone relates solely to past performance and is deemed reasonable upon consideration of the deliverables and the payment terms within the contract 
for non substantive milestones  including advance payments  the recognition of such payments are pro rated to the substantive milestones 
milestones may include  for example  the successful completion of design review or technical review  the submission and acceptance of technical drawings  delivery of hardware  software  spares  test equipment or regulatory agency certifications 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses we continuously evaluate our customers and provide reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations of the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
inventories the company values inventory at standard cost which generally reflects the most recent significant cost for manufactured or purchased inventory 
standards are revalued from time to time to reflect the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method fifo or net realizable value 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is based upon reviews of inventory quantities on hand  usage and sales history 
work in process inventories we employ certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
our practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  we will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for fiscal years and manufacturing overhead cost application we establish our inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating our overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed and adjusted annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with us gaap  which states that deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
property held for sale property held for sale is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
depreciation on property held for sale is discontinued at the time the criteria  established by us gaap  are met 
the earlysville  virginia property is presently held for sale 
the property consists of a  square foot manufacturing facility on approximately acres of land 
in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents by a former owner of the property 
as a result of the initial and subsequent surveys  the remaining contamination treatment costs are estimated at  as of january  we have capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  and costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  at this time  we cannot predict how much  if any  we will incur for more costs in fiscal year goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and will be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
as current events and circumstances warrant  the company examines the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite lives  such as capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets  to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause impairment include negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  we do not believe that any assets are impaired 
we will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software  and  b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
income taxes the company and its includable subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return in accordance with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not issue or invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates pertaining to our borrowings under our existing debt facilities which require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus to basis points 
we therefore are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
any increase in these rates could adversely affect our interest expense 
the extent of market rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates is not quantifiable or predictable because of the volatility of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we use no derivative products to hedge or mitigate interest rate risk 
based on the outstanding balances on our credit facilities as of january   a increase in interest rates would cost us approximately  annually 
we purchase materials for use in our products based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the materials purchased can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase agreements with reasonable terms 
we also have a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we have a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
our strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows
