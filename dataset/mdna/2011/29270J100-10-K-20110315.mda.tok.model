the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are in the business of designing  developing and manufacturing energy recovery devices for seawater reverse osmosis desalination 
our company was founded in and we introduced the initial version of our pressure exchanger tm energy recovery device in early in december  we acquired pump 
table of contents engineering  llc  which manufactures centrifugal energy recovery devices  known as turbochargers  and high pressure pumps 
a significant portion of our net revenue typically has been generated by sales to a limited number of large engineering  procurement and construction firms  which are involved with the design and construction of larger desalination plants 
sales to these firms often involve a long sales cycle  which can range from to months 
a single large desalination project can generate an order for numerous energy recovery devices and generally represents an opportunity for significant revenue 
we also sell our devices to many small to medium size original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which commission smaller desalination plants  order fewer energy recovery devices per plant and have shorter sales cycles 
due to the fact that a single order for our energy recovery devices by a large engineering  procurement and construction firm for a particular plant may represent significant revenue  we often experience significant fluctuations in net revenue from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
in addition  historically our engineering  procurement and construction firm customers tend to order a significant amount of equipment for delivery in the fourth quarter and  as a consequence  a significant portion of our annual sales typically occurs during that quarter 
in fiscal year  the fourth quarter revenues did not reflect as high of a percentage of the annual revenues as in past years due to shipment delays caused by customer project delays 
a limited number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenue and accounts receivables 
revenue from customers representing or more of total revenue varies from period to period 
for the year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue  for the year ended december   three customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue  and for the year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
no other customers accounted for more than of the company s net revenue during any of these periods 
see note concentrations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further customer concentration detail 
during the years ended december   and  most of our revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
we expect sales outside of the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our revenue is principally derived from the sales of our energy recovery devices 
we also derive revenue from the sale of our high pressure and circulation pumps  which we manufacture and sell in connection with our energy recovery devices for use in desalination plants 
we also receive incidental revenue from the sale of spare parts and from services  including start up and commissioning services  that we provide for our customers 
we expect our revenue in to be affected by the delayed effects of the global economic downturn on our industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial results will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are revenue recognition  warranty costs  share based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes including our evaluation of the need for any valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  and our evaluation and measurement of contingencies  including contingent consideration 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in demand deposit accounts with large financial institutions and invested in institutional money market funds 
we frequently monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds 
we have not experienced any credit losses from our cash investments 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer and general economic conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or market 
we calculate inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels  expected useful life and estimated future demand of the products and spare parts 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and reduced by accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives are generally three to ten years 
we own our manufacturing facility in new boston  michigan  which is depreciated over an estimated useful life of years 
a small portion of our manufacturing equipment was acquired under capital lease obligations 
these assets are amortized over periods consistent with depreciation of owned assets of similar types  generally five to seven years 
certain equipment used in the development and manufacturing of ceramic components is generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of up to ten years 
leasehold improvements represent remodeling and retrofitting costs for leased office and manufacturing space and are depreciated over the shorter of either the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease using the straight line method 
software purchased for internal use consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third party software providers and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives  generally three to five years 
estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and  when appropriate  changes are made prospectively 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred  whereas improvements and renewals are generally capitalized in their respective property accounts 
when an item is retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and applicable accumulated depreciation are removed and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
acquired intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from one to years 
acquired intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives 
customer relationships and other noncontractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally 
table of contents ranging from five to years 
patents developed internally are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful life of to years 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment or when indicators of a potential impairment are present 
the annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans 
as of december  and  acquired intangibles  including goodwill  relate to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc during the fourth quarter of see note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of intangible assets 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable and accrued expenses  accounts payable  and debt 
the carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values 
fair value measurements we follow the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures  which among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
the framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
our cash and restricted cash balances are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using market prices on active markets for identical securities level 
the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
the carrying amount of the contingent consideration arising from our acquisition of pump engineering  llc is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists level 
we estimate fair value of the contingent consideration based on an assessment of the weighted probability of payment under various scenarios 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title occurs  fixed pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
transfer of title typically occurs upon shipment of the equipment pursuant to a written purchase order or contract 
the portion of the sales agreement related to the field services and training for commissioning of a desalination plant is deferred using the residual value method 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements  assuming that the delivered elements have stand alone value 
vendor objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing in the future  which could 
table of contents result in changes to our vendor objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements 
the services element of our contracts represents an incidental portion of the total contract price 
under our revenue recognition policy  evidence of an arrangement has been met when it has an executed purchase order or a stand alone contract 
typically  smaller projects utilize purchase orders that conform to standard terms and conditions that require the customer to remit payment generally within to days from product delivery 
in some cases  if credit worthiness cannot be determined  prepayment is required from the smaller customers 
for large projects  stand alone contracts are utilized 
for these contracts  consistent with industry practice  our customers typically require their suppliers  including eri  to accept contractual holdback provisions whereby the final amounts due under the sales contract are remitted over extended periods of time 
these retention payments typically range between and  and in some instances up to  of the total contract amount and are due and payable when the customer is satisfied that certain specified product performance criteria have been met upon commissioning of the desalination plant  which may be months to months from the date of product delivery as described further below 
the specified product performance criteria for our px device generally pertains to the ability of our product to meet its published performance specifications and warranty provisions  which our products have demonstrated on a consistent basis 
this factor  combined with historical performance metrics measured over the past years  provides our management with a reasonable basis to conclude that its px device will perform satisfactorily upon commissioning of the plant 
to ensure this successful product performance  we provide service  consisting principally of supervision of customer personnel  and training to the customers during the commissioning of the plant 
the installation of the px device is relatively simple  requires no customization and is performed by the customer under the supervision of our personnel 
we defer the value of the service and training component of the contract and recognizes such revenue as services are rendered 
based on these factors  our management has concluded that delivery and performance have been completed when the product has been delivered title transfers to the customer 
we perform an evaluation of credit worthiness on an individual contract basis to assess whether collectability is reasonably assured 
as part of this evaluation  our management considers many factors about the individual customer  including the underlying financial strength of the customer and or partnership consortium and management s prior history or industry specific knowledge about the customer and its supplier relationships 
under the stand alone contracts  the usual payment arrangements are summarized as follows an advance payment due upon execution of the contract  typically to of the total contract amount  a payment upon delivery of the product due on average between and days from product delivery  and in some cases up to days  typically in the range of to of the total contract amount  and a retention payment due subsequent to product delivery as described further below  typically in the range of to  and in some cases up to  of the total contract amount 
under the terms of the retention payment component  we are generally required to issue to the customer a product performance guarantee that takes the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit  which is issued to the customer approximately to months after the product delivery date 
the letter of credit is either collateralized by restricted cash on deposit with a financial institution or funds available through a credit facility 
the letter of credit remains in place for the performance period as specified in the contract  which is generally to months and  in some cases  up to months from issuance 
the performance period generally runs concurrent with our standard product warranty period 
once the letter of credit has been put in place  we invoice the customer for this final retention payment under the sales contract 
during the time between the product delivery and the issuance of the letter of credit  the amount of the final retention payment is classified on the balance sheet as an unbilled receivable  of which a portion may be classified as long term 
table of contents to the extent that the billable period extends beyond one year 
once the letter of credit is issued  we invoice the customer and reclassify the retention amount from unbilled receivable to accounts receivable where it remains until payment 
we do not provide our customers with a right of product return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered that are covered by the terms and conditions of the product warranty 
product returns have not been significant 
reserves are established for possible product returns related to the advance replacement of products pending the determination of a warranty claim 
shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in sales 
the cost of shipping to customers is included in cost of revenue 
warranty costs we sell products with a limited warranty for a period ranging from one to six years 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product failure rates  historical activity and expectations of future costs 
periodically  we evaluate and adjust the warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
share based compensation we measure and recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including restricted stock units  restricted shares and employee stock options  over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the awards for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is based on our stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires a number of complex assumptions  including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimates are revised 
see note share based compensation to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of share based compensation 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar  while the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
the asset and liability accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their local currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of our subsidiary balance sheets are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes current tax assets and liabilities are based upon an estimate of taxes refundable or payable for each of the jurisdictions in which the company is subject to tax 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions 
we assess income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting dates 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
when applicable  associated interest and penalties are recognized as a 
table of contents component of income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining whether and to what extent any valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we have not provided any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  based on our evaluation of the weight of available evidence including available taxable income in prior carry back years and our five year history of profitability through 
during  we incurred an operating and net loss and we expect such losses to continue into as our industry seeks to recover from the global downturn 
to the extent that we continue to incur operating and net losses in future periods and recovery of our industry is delayed beyond our expectations  the resulting continuing losses over time will increase the likelihood that our judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets will change and that we will at some point determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or possibly all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable  which will require us to record a valuation allowance which in turn will adversely affect our future results of operations 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result

table of contents net revenue our net revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues from the sales of px devices and related products and services decreased by approximately million while revenues from the sales of turbochargers and pumps increased by approximately million 
the decrease in revenue from sales of px devices was primarily due to the timing of larger orders  a global decline in the construction of new projects  and competition 
additionally  there was a slight decrease in the average sales price of px units during fiscal year the increase in revenue from sales of turbochargers and pumps was primarily due to a full year of shipments by our subsidiary  pump engineering  inc  which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of  and the timing of larger orders 
revenues from the sales of our turbochargers and related products had a very small impact on our revenue base  totaling only million for the fiscal year 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
turbochargers and related high pressure pumps  manufactured by our subsidiary  pump engineering  inc  had a negligible impact on our product offerings in as the subsidiary was acquired late in the fourth quarter of the following geographic information includes net revenue to our domestic and international customers based on the customers requested delivery locations  except for certain cases in which the customer directed us to deliver our products to a location that differs from the known ultimate location of use 
in such cases  the ultimate location of use is reflected in the table below instead of the delivery location 
the amounts below are in thousands  except percentage data

the weakening global economy may cause our customers to delay or cancel plans for future orders of our products 

table of contents gross profit the following table reflects the impact of product sales activities to our overall gross margin for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages years ended december  px and related px and related products and turbochargers products and turbochargers services and pumps total services and pumps total net revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin turbochargers and related high pressure pumps had a negligible impact on overall gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year as the acquisition of pump engineering  llc occurred late in the fourth quarter of gross profit represents our net revenue less our cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials  personnel costs including share based compensation  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  depreciation expense  and manufactured components 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is raw materials  primarily ceramic materials 
for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a shift of product sales to lower margin turbochargers and high pressure pumps  a result of our acquisition of pump engineering  llc in late  and an increase in overhead costs related to our px devices  largely attributed to the underutilization of our newly expanded manufacturing facility 
additionally  the amortization of an inventory valuation step up of million  stemming from our acquisition of pump engineering  llc  and a slight decline in the average selling prices of our px devices also served to negatively impact gross margin in fiscal year future gross profit is highly dependent on the product and customer mix of our net revenues  overall market demand and competition  and the volume of production in our own ceramics factory and our assembly operations that determines our operating leverage 
accordingly  we are not able to predict our future gross profit levels with certainty 
in addition  our recent production facility expansion will continue to have a negative impact to our margins if our production volume does not increase in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of general and administrative expense was attributable primarily to the amortization of acquired intangible assets and an increase in general and administrative headcount related to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december and an increase in occupancy costs related to our new corporate headquarters 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of our net revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as general and administrative costs increased period over period while net revenue decreased 
of the million net increase in general and administrative expense  increases of million related to amortization of intangible assets  million related to occupancy costs  million related to compensation and employee related benefits  and million related to local taxes and other administrative costs 
these increases in costs were offset in part by decreases of million related to professional and other services  million related to changes in bad debt and other reserves  and million related to value added taxes vat 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative average headcount increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year largely as a result of the acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december increased compensation and employee benefit costs related to this increase in headcount were largely offset by the effects of cost cutting measures implemented at our corporate headquarters in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales and marketing headcount as a result of the pump engineering acquisition in december sales and marketing average headcount increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a percentage of our net revenue  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to lower net revenue for the current period 
the million net increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  was primarily related to increases in compensation  employee related benefits  and commissions to outside sales representatives as a result of the acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december sales and marketing headcount increased due to the acquisition 
additionally  pump engineering has historically relied on outside sales agents rather than inside sales representatives to generate sales  resulting in higher commission rates 
share based compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  research and development expense research and development expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of our net revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   as research and development expense increased for those periods while net revenue decreased 
of the million increase in research and development expense for the year ended december   million related to increased compensation and employee related benefits as a result of our acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december  million related to increased occupancy costs and consulting and professional fees  and million related to an increase in research and development direct project costs 
average headcount in our research and development department increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december share based compensation expense included in research and development expense was  for year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we expand and diversify our product offerings 
gain on fair value remeasurement we acquired pump engineering  llc in december under the business combinations guidance of us gaap  we initially recognized a liability of million as an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of contingent and other consideration  consisting of million of contingent consideration subject to pay out to the sellers upon the acquired company s achievement of certain milestones and of other consideration securing the sellers indemnification obligations 
the fair value measurement of the million of contingent consideration was based on the weighted probability of achievement  as of the acquisition date  that the milestones would be achieved 
in the fourth quarter of  some of the milestones were not met 
accordingly  we remeasured the contingent consideration at million to reflect its estimated fair value at december  and recognized a gain of million in our consolidated statement of operations

net revenue our net revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to customer project delays attributable to the global economic downturn and financial market crisis 
the average sales price of our px units increased resulting largely from more sales of our higher capacity px devices and served to offset some of the impacts of the customer order delays 
lastly  we experienced an increase in our service related revenue due to efforts targeted at increasing after market sales and services which also partially reduced the negative impacts stemming from the economic downturn

liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  if any  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories  the timing of introductions of new products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we may enter into potential material investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk currently  the majority of our revenue contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
in some circumstances  we have priced certain international sales in euros 
the amount of revenue recognized denominated in euros amounted to million  zero  and million in   and  respectively 
we experienced a net foreign currency gain loss of approximately   and  related to our revenue contracts for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as we expand our international sales  we expect that a portion of our revenue could continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents and operating results could be increasingly affected by changes in exchange rates 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies 
this expense could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
our exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the united states dollar versus the euro 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our consolidated operating results or financial position 
additionally  our international sales and marketing operations maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to decrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency  we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign currencies 
we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies 
table of contents have been insignificant to date  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate risk we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
concentration of credit rate risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from disruptions caused by recent financial market conditions 
currently  our cash and cash equivalents are primarily deposited in a money market fund backed by us treasury securities  however  substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are in excess of federally insured limits at a very limited number of financial institutions 
this represents a high concentration of credit risk
