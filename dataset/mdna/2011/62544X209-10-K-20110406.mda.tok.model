this decrease is primarily due to reduced dtv upgrade subsidies of approximately  and reduced dtv mdu subscriber activations as a result of more stringent dtv credit standards 
the company believes it can ultimately increase revenues by selling its support center services to its network of system operators and by providing ancillary programs for voice and data services to that same network 
however  due to the aforementioned stringent directv credit standards  reduced dtv mdu subscriber activations and anticipated weakness in the economy  the company expects mdu revenues to be relatively constant in costs of products and services exclusive of depreciation and amortization total costs of products and services were  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
this reduction is attributable to improved inventory controls which has decreased cost of products and services approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year  as well as a reduction in damage claims of  fleet costs of  and technician payroll of  cost of products and services for the year ended december   were  for the hsp segment compared to the  for the year ended december   a decrease

income taxes we have recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of for the year ended december  the company regularly assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies then records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets for amounts that are unable to be realized 
based on management s assessment of all available evidence  including previous years income  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  the company determined that the company will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a  income tax benefit for the year ended december  which includes a  release of the valuation allowance 
based on existing contracts  the company used a discounted projection of revenue and expenses  over the next five years  which approximates the remaining life of our hsp contract with directv including the one year renewal term  to determine the level of existing net operating loss carryforward we will be able to offset against taxable income in that period 
the company will continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if the company s actual results and updated projections vary significantly from the projections used as a basis for this determination  the company may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
the company would adjust its valuation allowance in the period the determi nation was made 
the company has federal net operating losses of approximately  and state net operating losses of approximately  which  if not used  will expire from changes in the stock ownership of the company have placed limitations on the use of these net operating loss carryforwards nols

critical accounting policies inventories the company s inventories are segregated into three major categories 
serialized directv inventories consist primarily of satellite receivers and similar devices 
non serialized directv inventories consist primarily of satellite dishes  poles and similar devices which are supplied by directv 
other inventory consists primarily of cable  switches and various small parts used in the installation of directv satellite dishes

impairment of long lived assets the company long lived assets include property  equipment  leasehold improvements and intangibles  subject to amortization 
at december   the company had net property and equipment of  which represents approximately of the company total assets 
at december   the company had net intangibles of  which represented approximately of the company s total assets see note 
the company annually reviews its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of th e asset 
an impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for the hsp segment  the income approach was used to measure fair value for those long lived assets 
the income approach was based on the present value of five years of future cash flows with an assumed growth of up to while applying a discount rate 
for the mdu segment  the market approach considering market multiples from comparable transactions were used to measure fair value of those long lived assets 
comparable transactions were identified based on their similarities to the reporting unit with similar features  age of equipment  and length of roe contracts 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge related to two work in process build out assets of the owners of the mdu properties are currently in financial distress 
the build outs may not ever be completed 
the company estimates that the full value of the work in process may not be recognized and has recorded an impairment charge against the value of the work in process 
in  the company did not record any impairment to long lived assets related to the hsp segment 
there was no impairment recorded for either segment at december  and impairment of goodwill in accordance with asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets without a defined life shall not be amortized over a defined period  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in oper ating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon th e residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses  which amounts to  as of december   may be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment charge of on the goodwill related to the us install purchase 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment related to goodwill 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge of on the goodwill related to the us install purchase and the remaining goodwill balance of from a previous acquisition 
group health and workers compensation insurance coverage the company uses a combination of self insurance and third party carrier insurance with predetermined deductibles that cover certain insurable risks 
the company records liabilities for claims reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported  based on historical experience and industry data 
insurance and claims accruals reflect the estimated cost for group health and workers compensation claims not covered by insurance 
the insurance and claims accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts 
such insurance and claims accruals are based upon individual case estimates and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience and industry data 
during  the company is self insured for workers compensation claims up to plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence involving workers compensation claims since that date 
during  in certain states  the company was self insured for workers compensation liability claims up to  plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence involving workers compensation claims since february  the company is self insured for health insurance covering the range of liability up to per claim where our management expects most claims to occur 
if any liability claims are substantially in excess of coverage amounts  such claims are covered under premium based policies issued by insurance companies to coverage levels that management considers adequate 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock options using fair value for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the company s expected stock price volatility  and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
income taxes the company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company considers projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies  then records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the net deferred taxes for these amounts that are more likely than not  unable realized 
based upon the company s assessment of all available evidence  including previous years income  estimates of future profitability  and the company s overall prospects of future business  the company determined that the company will be able to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded  of income tax benefit for the year ended december   which includes a  release of the valuation allowance 
based on existing contracts  the company used a discounted projection of its revenue and expenses over the next five years  which approximates the remaining life of our hsp contract with directv including the one year renewal term  to determine the level of existing net operating loss carryforwards it will be able to offset against taxable income in that period 
the company also analyzed its other deferred tax assets and liabilities outstanding at december  a portion of the valuation allowance was removed for the amount projected to reverse 
as of december   the company believed it was more likely than not that it would be unable to fully utilize the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was recorded as of that date 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was  and  respectively
