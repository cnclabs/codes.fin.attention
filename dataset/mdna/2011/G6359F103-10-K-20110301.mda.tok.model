item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower states  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil and gas markets in the world 
our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of over land drilling rigs  more than rigs for land well servicing and workover work in the united states and canada  offshore platform rigs  jack up units  barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
we invest in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities in the united states  canada and colombia 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  well servicing and workover operations and pressure pumping  on land and offshore 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in our oil and gas operating segment 
our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in our other operating segments 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
the primary determinant of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings  which i in our us lower land drilling and canadian drilling operations are largely driven by natural gas prices and ii in our alaskan  international  us offshore gulf of mexico  canadian well servicing and us land well servicing operations by oil prices 
both natural gas and oil prices impact our customers activity levels and spending for our pressure pumping operations 
oil and natural gas liquids prices are beginning to be more significant 
table of contents factors in some of the traditionally natural gas driven operating segments 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price thousand cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel beginning in the fourth quarter of  there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused  at least in part  by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets 
weaker demand throughout resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices  which led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services 
during  these commodity prices strengthened in the latter half of the year and demand for drilling activity improved 
continued fluctuations in the demand for gas and oil  among other factors including supply  could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results 
operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss attributable to nabors for the year ended december  totaled million and million 
per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing a decrease of billion  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss attributable to nabors for the year ended december  totaled million and million 
per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  during  operating results improved as compared to primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from our pressure pumping operating segment and increased drilling activity in in our us lower land drilling and canada well servicing operations relating to increased drilling activity in oil and the liquids oil shale plays 
our us well servicing business also improved with continuing strong crude oil prices  which have led to increased activity 
however  our operating results and activity levels continued to be negatively impacted in our us offshore operations in response to uncertainty in the regulatory environment  our alaskan operations due to key customers spending constraints  and elsewhere with less activity in saudi arabia and mexico  two of our key markets 
there was also improvement in our operating results for because there were no full cost ceiling adjustments recorded by our us oil and gas joint venture 
our us offshore operations were improving during the first half of until the gulf of mexico explosion and oil spill occurred mid year  which resulted in temporary suspension of offshore drilling and further delays in our customers ability to obtain permits  which has limited the use of our assets 
specifically  operating results have been impacted because our customers have suspended most of their operations in the gulf of mexico  largely as a result of their inability to obtain government permits 
although the previously issued us deepwater drilling moratorium has been lifted  it is uncertain whether our customers ability to obtain government permits will improve in the near term 
our alaska operating segment has been negatively impacted because the largest operator in the area has curtailed and suspended drilling operations  creating a surplus of rigs in the market and causing price competition 
we expect that these conditions will persist and continue to adversely impact our alaska operating results through we expect our international results to remain flat in as the increase of land rig activity is expected to be essentially offset by contract renewals on our jack up rigs at significantly lower average dayrates 

table of contents during  we recorded impairments and other charges of million 
we recognized goodwill and long lived asset impairments of approximately million and million  respectively  to assets in our us offshore operating segment  primarily driven by current market conditions in the gulf of mexico 
additionally  we recognized long lived asset impairments of million to our aircraft and some drilling equipment in canada and recorded impairments of million relating to asset retirements across our us lower land  us well servicing and us offshore contract drilling segments 
our oil and gas operating segment recorded impairments of million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable and million under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our wholly owned oil and gas related assets 
during and  our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and other impairments 
earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates includes million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and  representing our proportionate share of a full cost ceiling test writedown from our unconsolidated us oil and gas joint venture which utilizes the full cost method of accounting 
during  our joint venture used a month average price in the ceiling test calculation as required by the revised sec rules whereas during  the ceiling test calculation used the single day  year end commodity price that  at december   was near its low point for that year 
the full cost ceiling test writedowns are included in our oil and gas operating segment results 
during  impairments and other charges of million included recognition of other than temporary impairments of million relating to our available for sale securities  and impairments of million to long lived assets that were retired from our us offshore  alaska  canada and international contract drilling segments 
we also recognized a goodwill impairment of million relating to nabors blue sky ltd  one of our canadian subsidiaries  which eliminated the remaining goodwill balance relating to remote aircraft operations in canada 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of million to our wholly owned assets in our oil and gas operating segment under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for some of our oil and gas related assets and million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable during the year ended december  during  impairments and other charges of million included goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling million recorded by our canada well servicing and drilling operating segment and nabors blue sky ltd 
we recognized these goodwill and intangible asset impairments to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
we consider these writedowns necessary because of the duration of the industry downturn in canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery 
we also recorded impairment charges of million to our wholly owned assets in our oil and gas operating segment for some of our oil and gas related assets during the year ended december  our operating results for are still expected to increase from levels realized during  despite a moderating outlook of lower commodity prices during and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates 
the major factors that support our expectations of an improved year are an expected incremental increase from ancillary well site services  primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services  resulting from our acquisition in the third quarter of  and the anticipated positive impact on our overall level of drilling and well servicing activity and margins resulting from our new and upgraded rigs added to our fleet over the past five years  which we expect will enhance our competitive position as market conditions improve
