results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls through pipelines and related facilities  and supply  transportation and sales services  including purchasing and selling natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
the following table reflects our operating income by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years ended december   and we have removed from income loss from continuing operations  for each period  the amounts comprising the operating results of non core natural gas pipeline assets that we sold in november and presented the amounts in income loss from discontinued operations

our unhedged commodity position is fully exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these fluctuations can be significant when commodity prices become volatile 
we employ derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our commodity position and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the applicable authoritative accounting provisions  which can create volatility

summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
these systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines  gathering systems and storage facilities 
the lakehead system  together with the enbridge system in canada  forms the longest liquid petroleum pipeline system in the world 
our liquids systems generate revenues primarily from charging shippers a rate per barrel to gather  transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
the operating loss of our liquids segment for the year ended december  resulted from costs incurred in connection with the crude oil releases on lines a and b of our lakehead system 
we estimate that in connection with these incidents we will incur aggregate gross costs of million for the emergency response  environmental remediation and cleanup activities associated with the crude oil releases  before insurance recoveries and excluding fines and penalties 
in addition  during the period the pipelines were not in service  our operating revenues were lower by approximately million as a result of the volumes that we were unable to transport 
we anticipate substantially all the costs we have incurred from the releases will ultimately be recoverable under our existing insurance policies  excluding any fines and penalties we may be assessed 
we do not maintain insurance coverage for interruption of our operations  except for water crossings  and therefore  we will not recover the revenues lost while lines a and b were not in service 
the operating loss that resulted from the incidents on lines a and b was partially offset by transportation rate increases that went into effect in january and april  coupled with higher delivered volumes on our lakehead and north dakota systems 
the following factors also affected the operating results of our liquids segment for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was the following the completion and start up of our alberta clipper pipeline on april  higher average crude oil prices and volumes associated with the allowance oil we receive  additional revenue we recognized in resulting from our joint tolling arrangement with mustang pipe line  llc  or mustang  increased operating and administrative  power and depreciation costs associated with the additional assets we have placed into service in  and a non cash impairment charge associated with our abandonment of the west tulsa pipeline on our mid continent system 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines as well as natural gas treating and processing plants and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are associated with services we provide to gather and process natural gas and to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
generally  our revenues are in the form of fee for service arrangements and or sales of natural gas and ngls 
the following factors affected the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of million associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance compared with million of net losses for the comparable period of increased natural gas and ngl volumes on our anadarko system  our september acquisition of the elk city system  and

index to financial statements increased operating and administrative costs attributable to maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes and our september elk city system acquisition 
marketing our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 
included in the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december  were unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses of million  associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  as compared with million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains for the comparable period in further contributing to lower operating income for the year ended december  were relatively stable natural gas prices during the period  which limited our opportunities to benefit from significant price differentials between market centers 
derivative transactions and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and to reduce variability in our cash flows 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates 
we record all derivative instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of applicable authoritative accounting guidance

index to financial statements results of operations by segment liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota  and mid continent systems 
we provide a detailed description of each of these systems in item business

year ended december  compared with year ended december  the operating results of our liquids business were significantly affected by the crude oil releases from lines a and b of our lakehead system 
our discussion of the environmental costs associated with these crude oil releases is presented below in the section titled operating impact of lines a and b crude oil releases 
the immediately following discussion focuses on the operating results of our liquids business 
operating revenue of our liquids segment increased for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in primarily due to the increased average rates for transportation on all of our major systems  most notably those associated with our alberta clipper pipeline 
increases in average transportation rates on all three liquids systems contributed approximately million of additional operating revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the changes to our transportation rates included the following effective january   we increased the rates for transportation on our north dakota system to include a new surcharge related to the recent completion of our north dakota phase vi expansion program  referred to as north dakota phase vi  
table of contents 
index to financial statements effective april   we increased the rates for transportation on our lakehead system in connection with the completion of our alberta clipper pipeline 
we also increased the transportation rates on our lakehead system for additional facilities we added for which we receive a cost of service return and a true up for costs associated with the southern access pipeline  effective april   we extended by four years the term of the looping surcharge on our north dakota system  which is a component of north dakota phase v 
the impact of the term extension reduced the looping surcharge from per barrel to per barrel for all volumes originating from trenton  missouri ridge and alexander  north dakota delivered to tioga  north dakota  and effective july   we decreased the average transportation rates on all three of our liquids systems in connection with the annual index rate ceiling adjustment 
the operating revenue of our liquids segment was also improved due to an increase in average delivery volumes on our north dakota system that contributed an approximate million of additional operating revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the average trunkline delivery volumes of our north dakota system increased nearly percent  to  bpd for the year ended december  from  bpd during the same period in  while gathering volumes during these periods remained constant at  bpd 
the increase in average trunkline delivery volumes is attributable to our completion in late of north dakota phase vi  which increased the system s trunkline capacity to approximately  bpd from the  bpd that was previously available 
while the capacity of our north dakota trunkline approximates  bpd  many variables  including changes in scheduled maintenance and other operational factors  can limit or increase our ability to operate at that level 
our transportation tariffs allow our pipelines to deduct an allowance from our customers for the transportation of their crude oil 
we recognize revenue for this allowance at the prevailing market price for crude oil 
the average prices of crude oil during the year ended december  were higher than the average prices for the same period of for example  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil has increased approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared with the same period in as a result of the increase in crude oil prices  we have experienced an approximate million increase in allowance oil revenues 
offsetting the improved operating revenues for our liquids segment for the year ended december  is approximately million of lost operating revenue associated with the temporary shutdowns of lines a and b of our lakehead system resulting from the crude oil releases from these pipelines 
despite the temporary shutdowns of lines a and b  the average delivery volumes on our lakehead system increased to million bpd for the year ended december  from million bpd during the same period in prior to the occurrence of the releases  lines a and b were operating at approximately  bpd and  bpd  respectively 
lines a and b were out of service for eight and days  respectively  before they were returned to service 
the lower volumes and related revenue associated with the releases on lines a and b were partially offset by greater use of other pipelines on the lakehead system to facilitate the transportation and delivery of crude oil from the oil sands 
further offsetting the increases in operating revenue was million of revenue we recognized in the year ended december  resulting from an expired joint tolling arrangement with mustang pipe line  llc  or mustang  that we did not recognize for the same period in additional discussion of the operating revenue recognized for the year ended december  related to the joint tolling arrangement with mustang is presented below in our analysis 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased million from the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to increases in property taxes associated with assets we have placed in service coupled with modest increases on existing assets 
affiliates of our general partner charge us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
the above 
table of contents 
index to financial statements increases to operating and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower rent costs associated with the termination of our lease of line from an affiliate of our general partner 
power costs increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the increase in power costs is primarily associated with the higher volumes of crude oil transported on our north dakota system coupled with utility rate increases for power used by our lakehead system 
partially  offsetting the increases in power costs was a decline in usage by our lakehead system during the periods lines a and b were not in service 
the increase in depreciation expense of million is directly attributable to the additional assets we have placed in service during  the most significant of which are north dakota phase vi and the alberta clipper pipeline that we placed in service during the first and second quarters of  respectively 
in september  we removed from service the west tulsa crude oil pipeline on our mid continent system due to a significant decrease in throughput on the pipeline 
as a result  we recognized a million impairment charge during year ended december  to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to zero 
operating impact of lines a and b crude oil releases we reported two releases of crude oil from our lakehead system during the year ended december  that significantly affected the operating results of our liquids business 
the first release occurred on july   near marshall  michigan on line b of our lakehead system  and the second occurred on september  in an industrial area of romeoville  illinois on line a of our lakehead system 
we recognized approximately million of actual and estimated costs in our liquids business for the emergency response  environmental remediation and cleanup activities associated with the crude oil releases from lines a and b  and potential claims by third parties 
we revised our previous million estimate for these costs based upon our review of costs and commitments incurred through december   as well as additional information concerning the requirements for environmental restoration and remediation 
all of the increase in the estimate is attributable to the remediation and restoration of the areas affected by the crude oil released from line b  the total cost of which is now estimated to be million 
we have not revised our million cost estimate associated with the line a release  since we have substantially completed the cleanup  remediation and restoration of the areas affected by the crude oil release 
we continue to incur costs for air and ground water monitoring as well as professional fees  which are included in our estimate 
our estimates represent gross costs before insurance recoveries and do not include fines and penalties  or the previously disclosed lost revenue of approximately million 
our estimated costs for these incidents are based on currently available information and will be updated as considered necessary to incorporate material new information as it becomes available 
the actual charges we incur may materially differ from the foregoing estimates due to variations in any or all of the categories described above  including modified or revised requirements from regulatory agencies 
we expect to pay approximately percent of the estimated million of costs related to the line a and b incidents by the end of  but air  ground water monitoring  along with other professional and legal fees are expected to continue into future periods 
as we have indicated in the above discussion  the million of environmental costs we have estimated for the crude oil releases on lines a and b that we have included in operating income for our liquids business do not include estimated costs for fines and penalties to be assessed by federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
we expect to recognize such expenses for fines and penalties when sufficient information becomes available that will allow us to make a reasonable estimate for these costs  which amounts could be material to our operating results 
we maintain commercial liability insurance coverage that is consistent with coverage considered customary for our industry 
the commercial liability insurance covers costs associated with environmental incidents such as those we have incurred for the releases from lines a and b  excluding costs for fines and penalties 
we are included in the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by enbridge for its subsidiaries and affiliates  which has an aggregate limit of million for pollution liability through the policy renewal date of may  enbridge  its subsidiaries and affiliates  including us  have remaining coverage under these 
table of contents 
index to financial statements insurance policies of approximately million 
we do not maintain insurance coverage for interruption of our operations except for water crossings  and therefore  we will not recover the approximately million of revenues lost while lines a and b were not in service 
apart from the amounts for which we are not insured  we anticipate that substantially all of the costs we have incurred from the releases will ultimately be recoverable under our existing insurance policies 
we expect to record a receivable for any amounts we claim for recovery pursuant to our insurance policies during the period that we deem realization of the claim for recovery is probable 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income for the year ended december   representing an increase of million over the same period in the favorable results were primarily attributable to transportation rate increases that went into effect during  partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs and depreciation 
operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in operating revenue was due to the following increased average rates for transportation on all of our major systems as construction projects were completed as noted below  additional revenue we recognized in resulting from our joint tolling arrangement with mustang  higher delivered volumes on our lakehead system  additional storage fee revenue generated by our mid continent storage terminal system  and revenue recognized in resulting from our application of the provisions of regulatory accounting 
these increases in operating revenue were partially offset by lower average crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we received in connection with our transportation services 
the increases in average transportation rates on all three liquids systems contributed approximately million of additional operating revenue 
the rate increases included the following effective january   we increased the rates for transportation on our north dakota system to include an updated calculation of the two surcharges related to north dakota phase v  effective april   we increased the rates for transportation on our lakehead system in connection with the completion of stage of our southern access pipeline 
we also increased the transportation rates on our lakehead system for additional facilities we added for which we receive a cost of service return and a true up for costs associated with stage of our southern access pipeline  and effective july   we increased the average transportation rates on all three of our liquids systems in connection with the annual index rate ceiling adjustment 
during the year ended december   we recognized an aggregate of approximately million of operating revenues associated with our lakehead system related to prior periods 
we recognized million of revenue after determining that we had incorrectly invoiced three shippers for transportation services provided from october through december in connection with a joint tariff arrangement between enbridge energy  limited partnership  or the olp  and mustang 
we also recognized million of revenue during the year ended december  for volumetric differences associated with the transportation of crude oil primarily during the years ended december  and the volumetric differences resulted from discrepancies between the volumes we measured as delivered to the mustang pipeline system at lockport  illinois and the volumes that mustang reported as delivered at patoka 
average delivery volumes on our lakehead system increased approximately percent  to million bpd for the year ended december  from million bpd during the same period in this increase contributed an additional million to operating revenue 
the increase in average deliveries on our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lakehead system was primarily derived from increases of crude oil supplies from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the alberta oil sands 
the increases in crude oil supplies from the alberta oil sands were a result of two new upgraders that began operations in northern alberta during  the ramp up of expanding bitumen projects  and increased production out of the bakken formation located in the williston basin that covers parts of north dakota  montana  and saskatchewan 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was an approximately million increase in contract storage and spot storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system 
our mid continent system includes approximately storage tanks we own with a total storage capacity of million barrels 
during  we recognized million of revenue and a corresponding regulatory receivable for amounts that we recovered in future periods under the terms of the transportation agreements established for our southern access pipeline 
the revenue we recognized is due to fewer volumes being transported on our system than anticipated when our current rates were established under the cost of service recovery model 
these revenues were earned during  but were not realized as cash until when we updated our transportation rates to account for the lower actual delivered volume than estimated 
in april  we applied the provisions of regulatory accounting to the operations of our southern access pipeline when the facilities rate surcharge associated with the project was approved by the ferc 
the rates for the southern access pipeline were based on a cost of service recovery model that followed the ferc s authoritative guidance and was subject to annual filing requirements with the ferc 
the rates we were allowed to charge shippers associated with our southern access pipeline included an allowance that provided a rate of return to our partners 
our transportation tariffs allowed our pipelines to deduct an allowance from our customers for the transportation of their crude oil 
we recognized revenue for this allowance at the prevailing market price for crude oil 
the average prices of crude oil during the year ended december  were substantially lower than the average prices for the same period of for example  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil had decreased approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared with the same period in as a result of the decrease in crude oil prices  we experienced an approximate million decrease in allowance oil revenues 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the increase in these costs was primarily attributable to the following increased workforce related costs associated with the operational  administrative  regulatory  and compliance support necessary for our systems resulting from the recently completed expansions  higher operating costs associated with our lease of line from an affiliate of our general partner which contributed million to our costs  which we were recovering through a tolling surcharge on our lakehead system with the net effect on our cash flow and operating income expected to approximate zero over the life of the lease  increased costs for repair and maintenance activities and our pipeline integrity program  property tax increases associated with assets we had constructed and placed in service coupled with modest increases on existing assets 
additionally  no favorable property tax settlements were realized in  and increases in other variable costs incurred in relation to our expanded pipeline systems 
our general partner charged us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who were assigned to us or otherwise provided us with managerial and administrative services 
we experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
power costs decreased million in the year ended december   compared with the same period in the decline in power costs was primarily associated with the additional capacity provided by our southern access pipeline that enabled us to more efficiently utilize our pipelines to transport crude oil 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the increase in depreciation expense of million was attributable to the additional assets we placed in service during and  the most significant of which were the southern access pipeline stage and assets that we placed in service during the second quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively 
future prospects update for liquids our lakehead system is well positioned as the primary transporter of western canadian crude oil and continues to benefit from the growing production of crude oil from the alberta oil sands 
historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving the united states energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are an increasingly prominent source of supply 
over the last several years  as conventional crude oil production has declined  development of the alberta oil sands has more than offset this reduction 
the neb estimates that total wcsb production averaged approximately million bpd in and million bpd in volumes of wcsb crude oil production are comparable with production volumes from kuwait and venezuela  key members of opec 
the capp in june estimated future production from the alberta oil sands to continue to grow steadily during the next years  with an additional million bpd of incremental supply available by  based on a subset of currently approved applications and announced expansions 
we and enbridge are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil greater access to markets in the united states 
based on forecasted growth in western canadian crude oil production and completion of upgrader expansions and increased bitumen production  as well as a  bpd competitor pipeline that came on line in  the lakehead system deliveries are expected to average million bpd in the ability to increase deliveries and to expand the lakehead system in the future will ultimately depend upon a number of factors including crude oil prices and related development activities by crude oil producers in the region 
recently  north dakota and montana in the united states and the province of saskatchewan in canada have experienced tremendous growth in the development of crude oil and natural gas reserves from the bakken formation 
the latest data released in december by the eia shows that proved reserves of crude oil in north dakota have increased to billion barrels at december   an percent increase from december  further  the three forks formations  located underneath the bakken  is thought to be the next natural step in the development of this region 
in north dakota  the fourth largest oil producing state in the united states  oil production rose by percent in to about  bpd 
taking advantage of this growth opportunity  in january our north dakota system completed a  bpd expansion to reach a total annual capacity of  bpd 
we intend to further solidify our position in the bakken formation  with the announcement of several expansion projects that should increase our available capacity within this region 
partnership projects bakken pipeline expansion in august  we announced the bakken project  a joint crude oil pipeline expansion project with an affiliate of enbridge in the bakken and three forks formations located in the states of montana and north dakota  and the canadian provinces of saskatchewan and manitoba 
the bakken project will follow our existing rights of way in the united states and those of the enbridge income fund holdings in canada to terminate and deliver to the mainline system s terminal at cromer  manitoba  canada 
the united states portion of the bakken project will expand the united states portion of line by constructing two new pumping stations in kenaston and lignite  north dakota  and replacing an mile segment of the existing inch diameter pipeline that runs from these two locations 
the project also calls for an expansion at enbridge s existing terminal and station in berthold  north dakota 
when completed  the bakken project will increase the takeaway capacity from this region by  bpd  with further expansion available to increase the takeaway capacity to  bpd 
the united states portion of the bakken project will have an estimated cost of approximately million with an expected in service date in the first quarter of as of august  the bakken project had received sufficient long term shipping commitments from anchor shippers to enable the project to proceed with construction 
a binding open season was subsequently conducted to enable other shippers 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to secure capacity on the expansion at the same terms as the anchor shippers  which was successfully concluded in february with commitments received for an aggregate of  bpd of capacity 
portal reversal expansion project the initial phase of the bakken project  prep  will reactivate and reverse the flow of the existing line pipeline between berthold  north dakota and steelman  saskatchewan 
prep will have an estimated cost of approximately million and will be complete in early  making  bpd of the  bpd of capacity available at that time 
north dakota system reconfiguration we are undertaking a reconfiguration of our north dakota system for an estimated cost of million to expand the capacity by an additional  bpd from minot to clearbrook for total available capacity of approximately  bpd  which we expect to be available in the second quarter of cushing terminal storage expansion project we continue to experience strong interest from customers in securing access to long term contract storage capacity at our cushing terminal 
during late we began construction on nine new storage tanks at our cushing terminal with an approximate shell capacity of million barrels 
the additional storage tanks will have an estimated cost of million and are expected to be in service in early other matters pipeline integrity plan line b in connection with the restart of line b of our lakehead system with the phmsa  we committed to accelerate a process we had initiated prior to the release to perform additional inspections  testing and refurbishment of line b within and beyond the immediate area of the july  incident 
pursuant to this agreement  we are remediating on schedule those pipeline anomalies identified by us between the years and that were scheduled for refurbishment and anomalies identified for action in a july phmsa notification 
we have agreed to complete all required work within days of the september  restart of line b 
in addition to the required integrity measures  we also agreed to replace a  foot section of the line b pipeline that lies underneath the st 
clair river in michigan within one year of the restart of line b  subject to obtaining required permits 
the total cost associated with these integrity measures and pipeline replacement is estimated to be approximately million 
additional significant integrity expenditures may be required after this initial remediation program 
the pipeline integrity and replacement costs will be capitalized or expensed in accordance with our capitalization policies as these costs are incurred  the majority of which are expected to be capital in nature 
costs we incur for in line inspection  crack detection  tool runs and hydrostatic testing to verify the integrity of the pipeline will be expensed as incurred 
we are currently discussing with our customers recovery of these costs through the tolls on our lakehead system 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  as well as treating and processing plants and related facilities 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  ten natural gas treating plants and natural gas processing plants  excluding inactive plants and including plants that we idle from time to time based on current volumes  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide

we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services we provide and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of our natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on some of our intrastate pipeline systems 
customers paying these fees typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
additional revenues from our intrastate pipelines are derived from the combined sales of natural gas and transmission services 
other arrangements we also use other types of arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate  and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions in these commodities 
we hedge a significant amount of our exposure to commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
we provide additional information in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report about the derivative activities we use to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk 
the other types of arrangements we use to derive revenues for our natural gas business are categorized as follows percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 

table of contents 
index to financial statements percentage of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls extracted from natural gas that requires processing  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls 
percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw natural gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account at market prices  the resulting residue gas 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue natural gas with an energy content equivalent to the original raw natural gas we received as measured in british thermal units  or btu 
under the terms of each of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices in the near term on approximately to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive as compensation for our services 
as a result of entering into these derivative instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will pay and receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas  ngls and condensate  even though the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
many of the derivative financial instruments we use do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result we record the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in our operating results 
this accounting treatment produces unrealized non cash gains and losses in our reported operating results that can be significant during periods when the commodity price environment is volatile 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the primary factors affecting the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of are as follows a million reduction in unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  as compared with the same period of  increased natural gas and ngl volumes on our anadarko system  our september acquisition of the elk city system  and increased operating and administrative costs attributable to additional maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes and our september elk city system acquisition 
changes in the average forward prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate from december  to december  produced unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of million from the non qualifying commodity derivatives we use to economically hedge a portion of the commodity price exposure in our natural gas business 
the average forward and daily prices for natural gas at december  were lower relative to natural gas prices at december   while the average forward and daily prices of ngls were higher though the end of and lower thereafter relative to ngl prices at december  as a result of the lower natural gas forward prices  we experienced unrealized mark to market net gains on derivatives we use to fix the price of natural gas we sell 
partially offsetting the gains were unrealized mark to market net losses on the derivatives that we use to hedge our fractionation margins  which represent the relative difference between the price we receive from the sale of ngls and the corresponding cost of natural gas we purchase for processing 
as a result of lower natural gas forward prices and the higher and lower ngl forward prices  fractionation margins widened producing these derivative losses 

table of contents 
index to financial statements comparatively  the average forward and daily prices for natural gas were lower at december  in relation to prices at december   producing gains in our portfolio of natural gas derivatives  while the average forward and daily prices for ngls and condensate were higher at december  than at december   producing losses  which more than offset the gains associated with the natural gas derivatives 
the following table depicts the effect that unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains and losses had on the operating results of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  in millions hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges derivative fair value gains losses revenue for our natural gas business is derived from the fees or commodities we receive from the gathering  transportation  processing and treating of natural gas and ngls for our customers 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices in the near term on approximately to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive as compensation for our services 
as a result of this unhedged commodity price exposure  our margins generally increase when the prices of these commodities are rising and generally decrease when the prices are declining 
our volumes and revenues are the result of wellhead supply contracts and drilling activity in the areas served by our natural gas business  primarily the bossier trend  barnett shale  granite wash and most recently  the haynesville shale 
during the year ended december   overall natural gas volumes on our systems remained relatively flat in relation to the same period of however  at a system level our east texas system had lower volumes as a result of reduced drilling activity in the bossier trend  james lime and travis peak formations driven by the relatively low price of natural gas 
these lower volumes were slightly offset by the increased drilling activity in the haynesville shale  which are attributable to the higher yield of natural gas per well and lower costs associated with drilling natural gas wells in this area 
we experienced a significant increase in volumes on our anadarko system for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of  partially offsetting the lower volumes on our east texas and north texas systems 
the higher volumes on our anadarko system are primarily attributable to favorable pricing for ngls relative to the lower prices for natural gas has encouraged producers to increase production in the granite wash formation due to the high content of ngls in the natural gas stream 
acquisition of the elk city system in september  which contributed additional gathering and processing capacity and increased the capacity of our existing anadarko system 
the elk city system contributed average daily volumes of approximately  mmbtu d during the first full three month period we operated the system  which ended december  the operating income of our anadarko system was also favorably affected by our operation of the elk city system  which allowed us to capture natural gas production that was previously bypassing our system and contributed to the overall increase in operating income of our anadarko system 
the combined anadarko and elk city systems generated approximately million more operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in we expect the elk city system to be fully integrated with our anadarko system by the end of active drilling rigs in the areas we serve have increased percent during the year ended december  from levels that existed in the corresponding period in as a result of the increased drilling activity in the areas we serve  we expect our volumes to increase in future periods 

table of contents 
index to financial statements although demand for natural gas has begun to stabilize  declining natural gas prices over the past year have caused some producers to reduce their output of natural gas  which has in turn resulted in lower volumes on our systems relative to historical highs  particularly on our east texas and north texas systems 
we are positioned to capitalize on any future increases in natural gas production  in large part due to the expansions we have completed in recent years 
we anticipate the recent discovery of the haynesville shale in western louisiana and eastern texas could result in greater demand for our services 
the haynesville shale has the potential of being one of the largest natural gas discoveries in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system  increasing the demand for our services 
in february  we announced an expansion project on our east texas system to capitalize on the growth opportunities that exist in the haynesville shale area  referred to as the south haynesville shale expansion project 
for a discussion of our south haynesville shale expansion project  see future prospects for natural gas below 
in june we acquired natural gas pipeline assets for million that are complementary to our existing assets and our planned expansion into the south haynesville area 
the acquisition is expected to increase capacity of our east texas system by connecting a portion of our east texas system to the expansions we have underway in the south haynesville area 
a variable element of the operating results of our natural gas segment is derived from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements on our east texas  north texas and anadarko systems 
operating revenue less the cost of natural gas  or margin  derived from keep whole processing arrangements for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from the million we produced for the same period in however  the decline in margin derived from keep whole contracts was mostly offset by an increase in margin derived by our percent of liquids  or pol  type contracts 
we also continue to experience a trend of replacing or renegotiating some of our existing keep whole contracts with pol type contracts and other similar arrangements 
this trend may reduce our exposure to commodity price risk along with a portion of the operating income we derive from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements 
operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million higher for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in maintenance and other activities coupled with the operating costs associated with the additional assets we have in service 
affiliates of our general partner charge us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million contributed in the corresponding period of the following discussion presents the primary factors affecting the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of a million decrease that resulted from million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses from derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  as compared with gains of million for the same period of  lower average daily volumes of natural gas on our systems  as a result of lower natural gas production associated with reduced drilling by natural gas producers in the areas we served  a decrease of approximately million in revaluation losses associated with our inventories and in kind natural gas imbalances due to less volatile commodity prices during the year of when compared to the same period in  improved system gain loss experience that resulted from the processes and quality improvements implemented  hurricanes did not disrupt our operations in as they did in  and

changes in the average forward and daily prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate from december  to december   produced unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses of million for the year ended december  from the derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting we use to economically hedge a portion of the natural gas  ngls and condensate associated with our natural gas business 
the average forward and daily prices for natural gas were lower at december  in relation to prices at december   producing gains in our portfolio of natural gas derivatives  while the average forward and daily prices for ngls and condensate were higher at december  than at december   producing losses 
comparatively  at december   the average forward and daily prices for both natural gas and ngls were significantly lower than the prices at december   which produced million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains for the derivative instruments we used to fix the price of the natural gas purchased for processing and for the derivatives we used to hedge the sales prices of a portion of the ngls derived from processing natural gas 
the following table depicts the effect that unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains and losses had on the operating results of our natural gas segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  in millions hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges derivative fair value gains losses during the year ended december   ngl and condensate prices increased  while natural gas prices declined  which created a favorable environment for processing ngl and condensate 
comparatively  during the year ended december   commodity prices for ngl  condensate and natural gas experienced significant price erosion 
the rapid decline in commodity prices during the year ended december   led to million of revaluation losses with respect to our in kind natural gas imbalances as well as million of non cash charges to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to fair market value 
although commodity prices were significantly lower for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  a rapid decline in commodity prices did not occur and as a result we did not incur similar revaluation losses and non cash charges in the period 
during the year ended december   natural gas volumes on our systems decreased percent resulting from declines in production and shut in natural gas 
due to the significant decline in natural gas prices over  producers had reduced drilling activity levels compared to and the number of approved drilling permits in texas for the year ended december  had declined percent from the same period in existing active drilling rigs in the areas we served had also declined percent during the year ended december  from levels that existed in the corresponding period in operating income derived from keep whole processing arrangements for the year ended december  was million  represented a decrease of million  or percent  from the million we produced for the same period in the favorable pricing environment that existed for ngls and condensate for the year ended december  was less favorable for the same period in  which reduced the operating income we derived from keep whole processing arrangements 
natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  changes in weather  temperatures and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
during the year ended december  we recognized approximately million fewer losses related to measurement than in the same period for we implemented processes and quality improvements to enhance the operating conditions on our natural gas systems  which continued to reduce the level of system gain loss 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during the months from september to december  we experienced operational disruptions to our onshore natural gas facilities as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
our facilities sustained minimal physical damage from the hurricanes  although some of our natural gas systems had lower throughput and revenues from the months of september to december due to the inability of third party downstream facilities to receive deliveries of our natural gas and ngls 
these temporary disruptions curtailed our ability to gather unprocessed natural gas at our processing plants and transport natural gas to markets in the texas and louisiana regions 
approximately million of lost revenue associated with the hurricanes occurred during the september to december timeframe 
hurricanes did not disrupt our natural gas operations during the year ended december  operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to our implementation of enhanced cost reduction measures 
our efforts to closely monitor and reduce expenditures had yielded positive results by reducing the costs associated with material and supplies purchases  consolidating spend with particular vendors and lowering the costs for repairs and maintenance activities when compared to the year ended december  our cost reduction measures included temporarily idling some of our processing and treating facilities in response to current economic conditions 
the lower operating and administrative costs were partially offset by greater depreciation expense for our natural gas segment for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  as a result of the capital projects completed and placed into service in future prospects for natural gas we intend to expand our natural gas gathering and processing services through internal growth projects designed to provide exposure to incremental supplies of natural gas at the wellhead  increase opportunities to serve additional customers  including new wholesale customers  and allow expansion of our treating and processing businesses 
additionally  we will pursue acquisitions to expand our natural gas services in situations where we have natural advantages to create additional value for our existing assets 
south haynesville shale expansion in february  we announced plans to expand our east texas system by constructing three lateral pipelines into the east texas portion of the haynesville shale  together with a large diameter lateral pipeline from shelby county to carthage which will further expand our recently completed shelby county loop 
the expansion into the haynesville shale area is expected to increase the capacity of our east texas system by mmcf d 
commitments from natural gas producers in the form of demand payments  acreage dedications and other contractual structures were more than sufficient to proceed with the project 
we completed construction of a portion of the pipeline for the project during the second quarter of and the main trunkline to carthage in december and we expect construction of the facilities will continue through the second quarter of future compression will be layered in  as needed  after the completion of the facilities 
allison cryogenic processing plant in april  we announced plans to construct a cryogenic processing plant and other facilities on our anadarko system  which we refer to as the allison plant 
the allison plant will have a planned capacity of mmcf d and is intended to accommodate the resurgence of horizontal drilling activity that exists in the granite wash formation in the texas panhandle  where our anadarko system is located 
the allison plant  when operational  will increase the total processing capacity of our anadarko system to approximately mmcf d 
the allison plant is anticipated to be in service by the end of other matters elk city system acquisition furthering our growth strategy to expand our natural gas business  on september   we acquired the elk city system for million in cash  including amounts for working capital that are subject to adjustment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the elk city system extends from southwestern oklahoma to hemphill county in the texas panhandle 
the elk city system consists of approximately miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines  one carbon dioxide treating plant and three cryogenic processing plants with a total capacity of mmcf d and a combined current ngl production capability of  bpd 
the acquisition of the elk city system complements our existing anadarko natural gas system by providing additional processing capacity and expansion capability allowing us to further capitalize on growing volumes of natural gas from the granite wash formation 
we used the net proceeds from the million september issuance and sale of our senior notes due september  to pay for a portion of the acquisition and funded the remaining amount with short term borrowings of commercial paper  which we subsequently repaid with proceeds from our november equity issuance 
the results of operations of the elk city system have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the september  acquisition date within our natural gas segment

index to financial statements marketing the following table sets forth the operating results of our marketing segment assets for the periods presented 
the amounts have been revised to exclude the operating results associated with the non core natural gas assets we sold in november  as previously addressed in our natural gas segment discussion for the year ended december  in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income our marketing business derives a majority of its operating income from selling natural gas received from producers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to customers utilizing the natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas we purchase is produced in texas markets where we have expanded access to several interstate natural gas pipelines over the past several years  which we can use to transport natural gas to primary markets where it can be sold at more favorable prices 
our marketing business is exposed to commodity price fluctuations because the natural gas purchased by our marketing business is generally priced using an index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas is sold 
this price exposure arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the basis spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to the market access provided by our company owned intrastate natural gas pipelines  our marketing business also contracts for firm transportation capacity on third party interstate and intrastate pipelines to allow access to additional markets 
to mitigate the demand charges associated with these transportation agreements  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed sales margin inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating our exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where transporting the natural gas becomes uneconomical 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to natural gas transport capacity and the associated basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist with balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawals of natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although all of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact our operating results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is primarily priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term  fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
our marketing business pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  contributing to the lower operating income of our marketing business were relatively stable natural gas prices during the year ended december   which limited opportunities to benefit from significant price differentials between market centers

comparatively  during the year ended december   we had unrealized  mark to market net gains of million that was the result of narrower transportation and storage differentials from the increases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from december  affiliates of our general partner charge us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating income before unrealized non cash  mark to market  net gains declined as a result of the narrowed differences in the prices of natural gas between the prices we paid to purchase natural gas and the prices we received for the natural gas we sold to customers for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in although the volumes that our marketing business received from our natural gas segment assets remained relatively stable when compared to the year ended december   the revenue and related margin from the sale of those natural gas volumes declined 
the volatility that existed in the overall commodities markets during the year ended december   resulted in more opportunities for us to benefit from differences between the purchase and sales prices of natural gas  which resulted in higher operating income 
the less volatile pricing environment that existed during the year ended december  reduced the differences  or tightened the spread  between the purchase and sales prices of natural gas  which in turn reduced our operating income for the period 
the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december  were positively affected by unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of million associated with derivative financial instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance 
the non cash  mark to market net gains during the year ended december  were the result of narrower transportation and storage differentials 
during the year ended december   increases in the forward basis and absolute market prices of natural gas resulted in million of non cash  mark to market net losses in our portfolio of derivative instruments 
operating and administrative costs for our marketing segment were million lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in consistent with our natural gas business  our cost reduction initiatives implemented during resulted in lower operating and administrative costs

we expect to fund our current and future short term cash requirements for these items from our operating cash flows supplemented as necessary by issuances of commercial paper and borrowings on our credit facilities 
margin requirements associated with our derivative transactions are generally supported by letters of credit issued under our credit facilities 
our business strategy emphasizes developing and expanding our existing liquids and natural gas businesses through targeted acquisitions and organic growth 
our need for investment capital to fund our expansion projects  make acquisitions of new assets and businesses and to retire maturing or callable debt obligations is expected to be funded from several sources 
we expect to initially fund our long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions as well as retiring our maturing and callable debt first from operating cash flows  and then from issuances of commercial paper and borrowings on our credit facilities 
we expect to obtain permanent financing through the issuance of additional equity and debt securities  which we will use to repay amounts initially drawn to fund these activities 
our ability to obtain permanent financing is dependent upon our ability to access the public and private capital markets to obtain the financing necessary to fund these activities 
if market conditions change and capital markets again become constrained  our ability and willingness to complete future equity and debt offerings may be limited 
the timing of any future equity and debt offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and our credit rating at the time

we anticipate paying approximately percent of these costs before the end of  substantially all of which we expect to be covered by our insurance policy 
recoveries from our insurance carriers are anticipated to occur predominately over the and time periods

we have issued class a common units under this program for net proceeds of approximately million  including approximately million paid by our general partner to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
under the terms of the program  we can issue additional class a common units for gross proceeds of approximately million depending on market conditions 
credit facilities our credit facilities have a maximum principal amount of credit available to us at any one time of  million and mature in april we pay interest on the amounts outstanding at variable rates equal to a base rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the credit facilities 
in the case of eurodollar rate loans  an additional margin is charged which varies depending on our credit rating and the amounts drawn under the credit facilities 
we are also charged a facility fee on the entire amount of the credit facilities  regardless of the amount drawn  which also varies depending on our credit rating 
at december   we could borrow million under the terms of our credit facilities  determined by reducing the total credit available under our credit facilities by the principal amount of our commercial paper issuances and the balance of our letters of credit outstanding 
individual borrowings under the terms of our credit facilities generally become due and payable at the end of each contract period  which is typically a period of three months or less 
we have the option to repay these amounts on a non cash basis by net settling with the parties to our credit facilities  which we accomplish by contemporaneously borrowing at the then current rate of interest and repaying the principal amount due

in  we expect to spend approximately  million on system enhancements and other projects associated with our liquids and natural gas systems with the expectation of realizing additional cash flows as projects are completed and placed into service 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that we expect to record as property  plant and equipment during acquisitions we continue to assess ways to generate value for our unitholders  including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions or other strategic transactions  some of which may be material 
we evaluate opportunities against operational  strategic and financial benchmarks before pursuing them 
we expect to pursue potential acquisitions with a focus on natural gas pipelines  ngl pipelines  refined products pipelines  terminals and related facilities 
we will seek opportunities for accretive acquisitions throughout the united states  particularly in the united states gulf coast area  where we anticipate making asset acquisitions in and around our existing natural gas business 
we expect to obtain the funds needed to make acquisitions through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
all acquisitions are considered in the context of the practical financing constraints presented by the capital markets 
forecasted expenditures we estimate our capital expenditures based upon our strategic operating and growth plans  which are also dependent upon our ability to produce or otherwise obtain the financing necessary to accomplish our growth objectives 
the following table sets forth our estimates of capital expenditures we expect to make for system enhancement and core maintenance for the year ending december  although we anticipate making these expenditures in  these estimates may change due to factors beyond our control  including weather related issues  construction timing  changes in supplier prices or poor economic conditions  which may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 
additionally  our estimates may change as a result of decisions made at a later date to revise the scope of a project or undertake a particular capital program or an acquisition of assets 
we made capital expenditures of million  including million on core maintenance activities  for the year ended december  for the full year ending december   we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate the following total forecasted expenditures in millions system enhancements liquids integrity program line b integrity program core maintenance activities haynesville projects north dakota expansion program allison related expansion capital in addition to the million of forecasted expenditures related to the cao  we will incur an additional million for integrity costs on line b

index to financial statements we maintain a comprehensive integrity management program for our pipeline systems  which relies on the latest technologies that include internal pipeline inspection tools 
these internal pipeline inspection tools identify internal and external corrosion  dents  cracking  stress corrosion cracking and combinations of these conditions 
we regularly assess the integrity of our pipelines utilizing the latest generations of metal loss  caliper and crack detection internal pipeline inspection tools 
we also conduct hydrostatic testing to determine the integrity of our pipeline systems 
accordingly  we incur substantial expenditures each year for our integrity management programs 
in connection with the restart of line b of our lakehead system with phmsa  we committed to accelerate a process we had initiated prior to the release to perform additional inspections  testing and refurbishment of line b within and beyond the immediate area of the july  incident 
pursuant to this agreement  we are remediating on schedule those pipeline anomalies identified by us between the years and that were scheduled for refurbishment and anomalies identified for action in a july phmsa notification 
we have agreed to complete all required work within days of the september  restart of line b 
in addition to the required integrity measures  we also agreed to replace a  foot section of the line b pipeline that lies underneath the st 
clair river in michigan within one year of the restart of line b  subject to obtaining required permits 
the total cost associated with these integrity measures and pipeline replacement is estimated to be approximately million 
additional significant integrity expenditures may be required after this initial remediation program 
the pipeline integrity and replacement costs will be capitalized or expensed in accordance with our capitalization policies as these costs are incurred  the majority of which are expected to be capital in nature 
costs we incur for in line inspection  crack detection  tool runs and hydrostatic testing to verify the integrity of the pipeline will be expensed as incurred 
we are currently discussing with our customers recovery of these costs through the tolls on our lakehead system 
we expect to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of our pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection  maintenance and capital replacement 
we also anticipate that core maintenance capital will continue to increase due to the growth of our pipeline systems and the aging of portions of these systems 
core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
we anticipate funding system enhancement capital expenditures temporarily through borrowing under the terms of our credit facilities  with permanent debt and equity funding being obtained when appropriate 
construction projects in accordance with our business strategy  we seek opportunities where economically feasible to develop and expand our existing liquids and natural gas businesses through organic growth 
during  we announced several organic growth projects including the bakken project and prep in our liquids business and the south haynesville shale expansion and allison cryogenic processing plant in our natural gas business 
we expect the south haynesville shale expansion  allison cryogenic processing plant and prep to be completed and in service during  and the bakken project to be completed and in service in see future prospects update for liquids and future prospects for natural gas for further details on these projects

index to financial statements as the owner of our i units  enbridge management does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that we make a cash distribution to our general partner and the holders of our class a and class b common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of our total units owned by enbridge management will increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s listed and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase in i units is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the trading day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding on the record date 
the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to be made to our general partner 
in october  we effected the conversion of all our outstanding class c units into class a common units in accordance with the terms of our partnership agreement 
the conversion became effective upon the determination by our general partner that the converted class c units would have  as a substantive matter  like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics  in all material respects  to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of our outstanding class a common units 
our general partner made this determination after adjustments were made to the capital accounts of our limited partners in connection with the private placement of class a common units

regulatory matters ferc transportation tariffs effective january   we increased the rates for transportation on our north dakota system to include a new surcharge related to the recent completion of north dakota phase vi  which increased capacity on the pipeline from  bpd to  bpd 
this surcharge is applicable for the seven years immediately following the january  in service date of north dakota phase vi 
the mainline expansion surcharge is applied to all mainline volumes with a destination of clearbrook 
effective april   we extended the term of the looping surcharge  a component of north dakota phase v  with the ferc by four years so that it now expires on december  the effect of the extended term reduced the looping surcharge from per barrel to per barrel for all volumes originating from trenton  missouri ridge and alexander delivered to tioga

critical accounting policies and estimates our selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued 
accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical 
however  not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in such cases  we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations 
we accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations 
in addition to the above  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for our estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  actual results can and often do differ from these estimates 
any effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
each of these areas involve complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the audit  finance risk committee of enbridge management s board of directors 
revenue recognition and the estimation of revenues and cost of natural gas in general  we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for our natural gas and marketing businesses  we must estimate our current month revenue and cost of natural gas to permit the timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we generally cannot compile actual billing information nor obtain actual vendor invoices within a timeframe that would permit the recording of this actual data prior to preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on the best available volume and price data for natural gas delivered and received  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated 
table of contents 
index to financial statements data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each period reported 
we believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from the actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the consistency of our processes 
crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit in addition to other factors 
we estimate our crude oil measurement gains losses and our crude oil over short balance based on mathematical calculations and physical measurements  which include assumptions about the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of our crude oil over short balance or revision of our crude oil measurement gain loss estimates 
we include the crude oil measurement gains losses in our operating and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and the crude oil over short balance in accounts payable and other in the consolidated statements of financial position if the balance is a liability and in inventory if the balance is in an asset position 
capitalization policies  depreciation methods and impairment of property  plant and equipment we capitalize expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are replaced  improved  or the useful lives have been extended  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs  including any planned major maintenance activities  are expensed as incurred 
during construction  we capitalize direct costs  such as labor and materials  and other costs  such as direct overhead and interest at our weighted average cost of debt  and  in our regulated businesses that apply the authoritative accounting provisions applicable to regulated operations  an equity return component 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of system components and equipment that are worn  obsolete or near the end of their useful lives 
examples of core maintenance expenditures include valve automation programs  cathodic protection  zero hour compression overhauls and electrical switchgear replacement programs 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
examples of enhancement expenditures include costs associated with installation of seals  liners and other equipment to reduce the risk of environmental contamination from crude oil storage tanks  costs of sleeving a major segment of a pipeline system following an integrity tool run  natural gas or crude oil well connects  natural gas plants and pipeline construction and expansion 
we also began including a portion of our capital expenditures for well connects associated with our natural gas system assets as core maintenance expenditures beginning in regulatory guidance issued by the ferc requires us to expense certain costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the dot s office of pipeline safety 
under this guidance  costs to prepare a plan to implement the program  identify high consequence areas  develop and maintain a record keeping system  and inspect  test and report on the condition of affected pipeline segments to determine the need for repairs or replacements  are required to be expensed 
costs of modifying pipelines to permit in line inspections  certain costs associated with developing or enhancing computer software and costs associated with remedial mitigation actions to correct an identified condition continue to be capitalized 
we typically expense the cost of initial in line inspection programs  crack detection tool runs and hydrostatic testing costs conducted for the purposes of detecting manufacturing or construction defects consistent with industry practice and the regulatory guidance issued by the ferc 
however  we capitalize initial construction hydrostatic testing costs and subsequent hydrostatic testing programs conducted for the purpose of increasing pipeline capacity in accordance with our capitalization policies 
also capitalized are certain costs such as sleeving or

we record property  plant and equipment at its original cost  which we depreciate on a straight line basis over the lesser of its estimated useful life or the estimated remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins the assets serve 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
we routinely utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we record depreciation using the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines  utilities and similar entities 
under the group method  for all segments  upon the disposition of property  plant and equipment  the net book value less net proceeds is typically charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss on disposal is recognized 
however  when a separately identifiable group of assets  such as a stand alone pipeline system is sold  we recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income for the difference between the cash received and the net book value of the assets sold 
changes in any of our assumptions may alter the rate at which we recognize depreciation in our consolidated financial statements 
at regular intervals  we retain the services of independent consultants to assist us with assessing the reasonableness of the useful lives we have established for the property  plant and equipment of our major systems 
based on the results of these assessments we may make modifications to the assumptions we use to determine our depreciation rates 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses  the market and business environments to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the asset for recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from operating the asset as a going concern 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost  contract renewals and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital 
any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
goodwill is allocated to two of our segments  natural gas and marketing 
pursuant to the authoritative accounting provisions for goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill  but test it for impairment annually based on carrying values as of the end of the second quarter  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we make critical assumptions that include but are not limited to projections of future financial performance  which include commodity price and volume assumptions  the expected growth rate of our natural gas and marketing assets  residual value of the assets  and market weighted average cost of capital 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at the time we determine that an impairment has occurred  we will reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our intangible assets consist of customer contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas supply opportunities and contributions we have made in aid of construction activities that will benefit our operations 
we amortize these assets on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful lives of the underlying assets  representing the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
fair value measurements we apply the authoritative accounting provisions for measuring fair value to our derivative instruments and disclosures associated with our outstanding indebtedness 
we define fair value as an exit price representing the expected amount we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with market participants at the measurement date 
we employ a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs we use to measure recurring fair value into three distinct categories based upon whether such inputs are observable in active markets or unobservable 
we classify assets and liabilities in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our methodology for categorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest level to unobservable inputs as outlined below level we include in this category the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
we consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
the fair value of our assets and liabilities included in this category consists primarily of exchange traded derivative instruments 
level we categorize the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure with either directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the measurement date  where pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets for the identical instrument  as level this category includes both over the counter  or otc  transactions valued using exchange traded pricing information in addition to assets and liabilities that we value using either models or other valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including a quoted prices for assets and liabilities  b time value  c volatility factors  and d current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the assets and liabilities  can be derived from observable data  or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level we include in this category the fair value of assets and liabilities that we measure based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs which are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources 
ie  values supported by lesser volumes of market activity 
we may also use these inputs with internally developed methodologies that result in our best estimate of the fair value 
level assets and liabilities primarily include debt and derivative instruments for which we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence  such as binding broker quotes  to support classifying the asset or liability as level additionally  level valuations may utilize modeled pricing inputs to derive forward valuations  which may include some or all of the following inputs non binding broker quotes  time value  volatility  correlation  and extrapolation methods 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the approximate fair values of our long term debt obligations are determined using a standard methodology that incorporates pricing points that are obtained from independent third party investment dealers who actively make markets in our debt securities  which we use to calculate the present value of the principal obligation to be repaid at maturity and all future interest payment obligations for any debt outstanding 
we utilize a mid market pricing convention  or the market approach  for valuation as a practical expedient for assigning fair value to our derivative assets and liabilities 
our assets are adjusted for the non performance risk of our counterparties using their current credit default swap spread rates 
likewise  in the case of our liabilities  our nonperformance risk is considered in the valuation  and is also adjusted quarterly based on current default swap spread rates on our outstanding indebtedness 
we present the fair value of our derivative contracts net of cash paid or received pursuant to collateral agreements on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial position when we believe a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable master netting agreement 
our credit exposure for over the counter derivatives is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of the contracts 
as appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as credit and liquidity considerations 
derivative financial instruments our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt and commodity prices and fractionation margins the relative difference between the price we receive from ngl sales and the corresponding cost of natural gas purchases 
in order to manage the risks to unitholders  we use a variety of derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to create offsetting positions to specific commodity or interest rate exposures 
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance  we record all derivative financial instruments to our consolidated statements of financial position at fair market value 
we record the fair market value of our derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of financial position as current and long term assets or liabilities on a net basis by counterparty 
derivative balances are shown net of cash collateral received or posted where master netting agreements exist 
for those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under authoritative accounting guidance  the accounting treatment depends on the intended use and designation of each instrument 
we record changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in our consolidated statements of income as follows natural gas and marketing segments commodity based derivatives cost of natural gas liquids segment commodity based derivatives operating revenue and power corporate interest rate derivatives interest expense our formal hedging program provides a control structure and governance for our hedging activities specific to identified risks and time periods  which are subject to the approval and monitoring by the board of directors of enbridge management or a committee of senior management of our general partner 
we employ derivative financial instruments in connection with an underlying asset  liability or anticipated transaction and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment that we use are cash flow hedges 
we enter into cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions 
price assumptions we use to value our non qualifying derivative financial instruments can affect net income for each period 
we use published market price information where available  or quotations from otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  including credit risk of our counterparties 
the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these valuations are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at inception  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the risk management objectives  and the methods used for assessing and testing correlation and hedge 
table of contents 
index to financial statements effectiveness 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item 
furthermore  we regularly assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties to manage against the risk of default 
if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively by including changes in the fair value of the derivative in current earnings 
we record the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as effective cash flow hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized immediately in earnings 
our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting as required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap  for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we use derivative financial instruments such as basis swaps and other similar derivative financial instruments to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
however  these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under authoritative accounting guidance  and as a result we record changes in the fair value of these instruments on the statement of financial position and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than deferring them until the firm commitment or anticipated transactions affect earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for derivative financial instruments can cause non cash earnings volatility resulting from changes in the underlying indices  primarily commodity prices 
commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to past or current operations 
we expense amounts we incur for remediation of existing environmental contamination caused by past operations that do not benefit future periods by preventing or eliminating future contamination 
we record liabilities for environmental matters when assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors 
these amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information and are included in environmental liabilities and other long term liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from the liability and  when recovery is probable  we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize liabilities for other commitments and contingencies when  after fully analyzing the available information  we determine it is either probable that an asset has been impaired  or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount  or if no amount is more likely than another  we accrue the minimum of the range of probable loss 
we typically expense legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such costs are incurred

qualitative factors hedge accounting we record all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value  which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value  which we refer to as marking to market  or mark to market 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay to transfer a liability or receive to sell an asset in an orderly transaction with market participants  to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the derivative financial instruments we utilize 
in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance  if a derivative financial instrument does not qualify as a hedge  or is not designated as a hedge  the derivative is marked to market each period with the increases and decreases in fair market value recorded in our consolidated statements of income as increases and decreases in operating revenue  cost of natural gas and power for our commodity based derivatives and interest expense for our interest rate derivatives 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  we settle our derivative contracts when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
if a derivative financial instrument qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge  which is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or future cash flows  any unrealized mark to market gain or loss is deferred in aoci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
to the extent that the hedge instrument is effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the income statement 
at inception and on a quarterly basis  we formally assess whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized each period in earnings 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are included in cost of natural gas for commodity hedges and interest expense for interest rate hedges in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs

index to financial statements hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain in aoci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
generally  our preference is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment whenever possible to mitigate the non cash earnings volatility that arises from recording the changes in fair value of our derivative financial instruments through earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
non qualified hedges many of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance 
however  we have transaction types associated with our commodity and interest rate derivative financial instruments where the hedge structure does not meet the requirements to apply hedge accounting 
as a result  these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting and are referred to as non qualifying 
these non qualifying derivative financial instruments are marked to market each period with the change in fair value  representing unrealized gains and losses  included in operating revenue  cost of natural gas  power or interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility that can often be significant from period to period  but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
the cash flow impact occurs when the underlying physical transaction takes place in the future and the associated financial instrument contract settlement is made 
the following transaction types do not qualify for hedge accounting and contribute to the volatility of our income and cash flows commodity price exposures transportation in our marketing segment  when we transport natural gas from one location to another  the pricing index used for natural gas sales is usually different from the pricing index used for natural gas purchases  which exposes us to market price risk relative to changes in those two indices 
by entering into a basis swap  where we exchange one pricing index for another  we can effectively lock in the margin  representing the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  on the combined natural gas purchase and natural gas sale  removing any market price risk on the physical transactions 
although this represents a sound economic hedging strategy  the derivative financial instruments ie  the basis swaps we use to manage the commodity price risk associated with these transportation contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  since only the future margin has been fixed and not the future cash flow 
as a result  the changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings 
storage in our marketing segment  we use derivative financial instruments ie  natural gas swaps to hedge the relative difference between the injection price paid to purchase and store natural gas and the withdrawal price at which the natural gas is sold from storage 
the intent of these derivative financial instruments is to lock in the margin  representing the difference between the price paid for the natural gas injected and the price received upon withdrawal of the natural gas from storage in a future period 
we do not pursue cash flow hedge accounting treatment for these storage transactions since the underlying forecasted injection or withdrawal of natural gas may not occur in the period as originally forecast 
this can occur because we have the flexibility to make changes in the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule  based on changes in market conditions 
in addition  since the physical natural gas is recorded at the lower of cost or market  timing differences can result when the derivative financial instrument is settled in a period that is different from the period the physical natural gas is sold from storage 
as a result  derivative financial instruments associated with our natural gas storage activities can create volatility in our earnings 
natural gas collars in our natural gas segment  we previously entered into natural gas collars to hedge the sales price of natural gas 
the natural gas collars were based on a new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  pricing index  while the physical gas sales were based on a different index 
to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements better align the index of the natural gas collars with the index of the underlying sales  we de designated the original cash flow hedging relationship with the intent of contemporaneously re designating the natural gas collars as hedges of forecasted physical natural gas sales with a nymex pricing index 
however  because the fair value of these derivative instruments was a liability to us at re designation  they are considered net written options and  pursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are being marked to market  with the changes in fair value from the date of de designation recorded to earnings each period 
as a result  our operating income is subject to greater volatility due to movements in the prices of natural gas until the underlying long term transactions are settled 
optional natural gas processing volumes in our natural gas segment  we use derivative financial instruments to hedge the volumes of ngls produced from our natural gas processing facilities 
some of our natural gas contracts allow us the choice of processing natural gas when it is economical and to cease doing so when processing becomes uneconomic 
we have entered into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of a portion of the ngls that we produce at our discretion and to fix the associated purchase price of natural gas required for processing 
we typically designate derivative financial instruments associated with ngls we produce per contractual processing requirements as cash flow hedges when the processing of natural gas is probable of occurrence 
however  we are precluded from designating the derivative financial instruments as qualifying hedges of the respective commodity price risk when the discretionary processing volumes are subject to change 
as a result  our operating income is subject to increased volatility due to fluctuations in ngl prices until the underlying transactions are settled or offset 
ngl forward contracts in our natural gas segment  we use forward contracts to fix the price of ngls we purchase and store in inventory and to fix the price of ngls that we sell from inventory to meet the demands of our customers that sell and purchase ngls 
prior to april   these forward contracts were not treated as derivative financial instruments pursuant to the normal purchase normal sale  or npns  exception allowed under authoritative accounting guidance  since the forward contracts resulted in physical receipt or delivery of ngls 
however  evolving markets for ngls have increased opportunities for a portion of our forward contracts to be settled net rather than physically receiving or delivering the ngls 
accordingly  we have revoked the npns election on certain forward contracts associated with the liquids marketing operations of dufour petroleum  lp  our wholly owned subsidiary  executed after april  the forward contracts for which we have revoked the npns election do not qualify for hedge accounting and are being marked to market each period with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
as a result  our operating income is subject to additional volatility associated with fluctuations in ngl prices until the forward contracts are settled 
natural gas forward contracts in our marketing segment  we use forward contracts to sell natural gas to our customers 
historically  we have not considered these contracts to be derivatives under the npns exception allowed by authoritative accounting guidance 
in the first quarter of  we determined that a sub group of physical natural gas sales contracts with terms allowing for economic net settlement did not qualify for the npns scope exception  and are being marked to market each period with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
as a result  our operating income is subject to additional volatility associated with the changes in fair value of these contracts 
crude oil contracts in our liquids segment  we use forward contracts to hedge a portion of the crude oil length inherent in the operation of our pipelines  which we subsequently sell at market rates 
in  we began executing derivative financial instruments for the current year and for  which fixes the sales prices we receive in the future for this crude oil 
we elected not to designate these derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges due to the relatively small volumes involved 
as a result  our operating income is subject to additional volatility associated with fluctuations in crude oil prices until the underlying transactions are settled or offset 
power purchase agreements in our liquids segment  we use forward physical power agreements to fix the price of a portion of the power consumed by our pumping stations in the transportation of crude oil in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our owned pipelines 
we designate these derivative agreements as non qualifying hedges because they fail to meet the criteria for cash flow hedging or npns exception 
as various states that our pipelines operate in have legislated either partially or fully deregulated power markets  we have the opportunity to create economic hedges on power exposure within the requirements of applicable risk policies 
as a result  our operating income is subject to additional volatility associated with changes in the fair value changes of these agreements due to fluctuations in forward power prices 
interest rate risk exposures interest rate caps at the corporate level  our earnings and cash flows are affected by fluctuations in interest rates associated with our variable interest rate debt 
our variable interest rate borrowing cost is determined at the time of each borrowing or interest rate reset based upon a posted libor for the period of borrowing or interest rate reset  increased by a defined credit spread 
in order to mitigate the negative effect that increasing interest rates can have on our cash flows  we have entered into interest rate caps  which establish a ceiling averaging approximately on the interest rates we pay on up to million of our variable rate indebtedness 
although our interest rate caps protect us from the adverse effect of higher interest rates  they do not qualify for hedge accounting and  as a result  changes in the market value of these instruments creates additional volatility in our earnings 
in all instances related to the commodity exposures described above  the underlying physical purchase  storage and sale of the commodity is accounted for on a historical cost or market basis rather than on the mark to market basis we employ for the derivative financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage and transportation assets 
this difference in accounting ie  the derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair market value while the physical transactions are recorded at historical cost can and has resulted in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
we record changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in our consolidated statements of income as follows natural gas and marketing segments commodity based derivatives cost of natural gas liquids segment commodity based derivatives operating revenue and power corporate interest rate derivatives interest expense the changes in fair value of our derivatives are also presented as a reconciling item on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the following table presents the net unrealized gains and losses associated with the changes in fair value of our derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  liquids segment non qualified hedges natural gas segment hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges commodity derivative fair value gains losses corporate non qualified interest rate hedges derivative fair value gains losses

index to financial statements derivative positions our derivative financial instruments are included at their fair values in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows december  in millions other current assets other assets  net accounts payable and other other long term liabilities the changes in the net assets and liabilities associated with our derivatives are primarily attributable to the effects of new derivative transactions we have entered at prevailing market prices  settlement of maturing derivatives and the change in forward market prices of our remaining hedges 
our portfolio of derivative financial instruments is largely comprised of long term natural gas and ngl sales and purchase agreements 
we record the change in fair value of our highly effective cash flow hedges in aoci until the derivative financial instruments are settled  at which time they are reclassified to earnings 
also included in aoci are unrecognized gains of approximately million associated with derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were classified as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions that were subsequently de designated 
these losses are reclassified to earnings over the periods during which the originally hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
we estimate that approximately million  representing unrealized net losses from our cash flow hedging activities based on pricing and positions at december   will be reclassified from aoci to earnings during the next months 
in connection with our march issuance and sale of million in principal amount of our senior notes due march   which we refer to as the notes  we paid million to settle treasury locks we entered to hedge the interest payments on a portion of these obligations through the maturity date of the notes 
we also received million to settle treasury locks associated with our september issuance and sale of million in principal amount of our senior notes due september   which we refer to as the notes  that we entered to hedge the interest payments on a portion of the obligations through the maturity date of the notes 
both the million and million settlement amounts are being amortized from aoci to interest expense over the respective and year terms  respectively  of the and notes 
the table below summarizes our derivative balances by counterparty credit quality negative amounts represent our net obligations to pay the counterparty

as the net value of our derivative financial instruments has decreased in response to changes in forward commodity prices  our outstanding financial exposure to third parties has also declined 
when credit thresholds 
table of contents 
index to financial statements are met pursuant to the terms of our isda financial contracts  we have the right to require collateral from our counterparties 
we have included any cash collateral received in the balances listed above 
when we are in a position of posting collateral to cover our counterparties exposure to our non performance  the collateral is provided through letters of credit  which are not reflected above 
the isda agreements and associated credit support  which govern our financial derivative transactions  contain no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our outstanding transactions 
a change in ratings is not an event of default under these instruments  and the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to transacting under the isda agreements 
in the event of a credit downgrade  additional collateral may be required to be posted under the agreement if we are in a liability position to our counterparty  but the agreement will not automatically terminate or require immediate settlement of amounts due 
the isda agreements  in combination with our master netting agreements  and credit arrangements governing our interest rate and commodity swaps require that collateral be posted per tiered contractual thresholds based on the credit rating of each counterparty 
we generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such collateral requirements under our isda agreements 
these agreements will require additional collateral postings of up to on net liability positions in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade 
automatic termination clauses that exist are related only to non performance activities  such as the refusal to post collateral when contractually required to do so 
when we are holding an asset position  our counterparties are likewise required to post collateral on their liability our asset exposures  also determined by the tiered contractual collateral thresholds 
counterparty collateral may consist of cash or letters of credit  both of which must be fulfilled with immediately available funds 
at december   we were in an overall net liability position of million  which included assets of million 
in the event that our credit ratings were to decline to the lowest level of investment grade  as determined by s p and moody s  we would be required to provide additional amounts under our existing letters of credit to meet the requirements of our isda agreements 
for example if our credit ratings had been at the lowest level of investment grade at december  we would have been required to provide additional letters of credit in the amount of million 
at december  and  we had credit concentrations in the following industry sectors  as presented below december  in millions us financial institutions and investment banking entities non us financial institutions small non integrated energy companies integrated oil companies we are holding no cash collateral on our asset exposures  and we have provided letters of credit totaling million and million relating to our liability exposures pursuant to the margin thresholds in effect at december  and  respectively  under our isda agreements
