item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass seven segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the us retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities  retirement and asset management segments 
the us individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
our corporate and other operations include our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which are reflected in corporate and other operations 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 

table of contents we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
at the time of demutualization  we determined the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
the closed block business is not a separate legal entity from the financial services businesses  however  they are operated as separate entities and are separated for financial reporting purposes 
the financial services businesses are not obligated to pay dividends on closed block policies 
dividends on closed block policies reflect the experience of the closed block over time and are subject to adjustment by prudential insurance s board of directors 
further  our plan of demutualization provides that we are not required to pay dividends on policies within the closed block from assets that are not within the closed block and that the establishment of the closed block does not represent a guarantee that any certain level of dividends will be maintained 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 

table of contents profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our ability to manage and control our operating expenses  including overhead expenses  our returns on invested assets  including the impact of credit losses  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  our credit and financial strength ratings  our ability to effectively utilize our tax capacity  our returns on proprietary investments we make  our ability to manage risk and exposures  including the degree to which  and the effectiveness of  hedging these risks and exposures  our ability to effectively deploy capital  and our ability to attract and retain talent 
in addition  factors such as credit and real estate market conditions  regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  market fluctuations and general economic  market and political conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
see risk factors for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

table of contents executive summary prudential financial  a financial services leader with approximately billion of assets under management as of december   has operations in the united states  asia  europe and latin america 
through our subsidiaries and affiliates  we offer a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  annuities  retirement related services  mutual funds  investment management  and real estate services 
we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
industry trends our us and international businesses are impacted by financial markets  economic conditions  regulatory oversight  and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete 
us businesses financial and economic environment 
our businesses and results of operations are impacted by general economic and market conditions and are sensitive to changes in equity markets  interest rates and real estate valuations 
the adverse market and economic conditions that began in the second half of have improved 
the equity and fixed income markets continue to recover while the real estate markets stabilize and begin to show signs of recovery 
interest rates and the pace and extent of changes in rates have impacted the profitability of certain products we offer as well as returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities and equity 
disruptions in the credit markets in recent years have also limited sales opportunities for certain products we offer 
regulatory environment 
our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision 
the financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced  and are expected to continue to produce  extensive changes in existing laws and regulations  and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses 
in particular  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law on july  made comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the us and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation 
in addition  state insurance laws regulate all aspects of our us insurance businesses and our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws 
insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital  particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities  and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements 
in addition  congress from time to time considers legislation impacting us federal income tax laws  such as the possible elimination of the dividends received deduction  which could adversely impact profitability or make our products less attractive to consumers 
demographics 
income protection  wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to shape the insurance industry 
retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the us for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them 
the risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to shift to employees  away from the government and employers 
life insurance ownership among us households has reached its lowest point in fifty years  with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of coverage 
competitive environment 
our annuities  retirement and asset management businesses operate in a highly competitive environment 
for the annuities business  market volatility in recent years has led many companies within the industry to reduce risks in product features and increase costs 
in addition  some peer companies have either exited the variable annuity marketplace or substantially reduced product features 
we believe our innovative product offerings have increased our competitiveness  thus increasing our sales 
all of our new variable annuity sales  as well as a significant portion of our in force business  where an optional living benefit has been elected  include an automatic rebalancing feature  which is valued in the marketplace 
our retirement and asset management businesses compete on price  service and investment performance 
the full service retirement markets are mature  with few dominant players 
we have seen a trend toward unbundling of the 
table of contents purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings  where the variety of available funds and their performance are the key selection criteria of plan sponsors and intermediaries 
market disruption and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our institutional investment product competitors to withdraw from the market  creating significant growth opportunities for us in certain markets  including the investment only stable value market 
the continued recovery of the equity  fixed income  and real estate markets in have positively impacted asset managers by increasing assets and therefore fee levels 
in addition  institutional fixed income managers have generally experienced positive flows as investors have re allocated assets into fixed income to reduce risk  including the reduction of risk in pension plans 
the individual life and group life and disability markets are mature and  due to the large number of competitors  competition is driven mainly by price and service 
the economy has exacerbated pressure on pricing  creating an even greater challenge of maintaining pricing discipline 
this has negatively impacted our individual life sales  in an industry which has shifted toward non proprietary distribution channels  which are more price sensitive than proprietary distribution channels 
for group products  rate guarantees have become the industry norm  with rate guarantee durations trending upward as a general industry practice 
there is also an increased demand from clients for bundling of products and services to streamline administration and save costs by dealing with fewer carriers 
as employers are attempting to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees  who continue to value benefits offered in the workplace  employee pay voluntary product offerings and services are becoming increasingly important in the group market 
industry sales of voluntary products  as well as our own  were up again in despite the economic downturn 
international businesses financial and economic environment 
our international businesses and the financial results of these operations are impacted by the global economy as well as the financial and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates 
similar to our us businesses  interest rates and the pace and extent of changes in rates have impacted the profitability of certain products we offer as well as returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities and equity 
our japanese operations have operated in this environment for an extended period 
we are also subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates  particularly the japanese yen 
regulatory environment 
our international insurance and investments operations are subject to comprehensive local regulation and supervision 
it is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead to changes in existing laws and regulations  and regulatory frameworks affecting our international businesses 
the financial services agency fsa  the insurance regulator in japan  has proposed revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company s core capital is calculated 
these changes are expected to become effective for the fiscal year ending march  the capital requirements in korea and taiwan are also undergoing changes 
the fsa in japan has introduced other measures to prevent  in the future  similar problems to those experienced during the recent financial crisis  including a new regulatory framework for credit rating agencies  strengthened disclosure requirements and increased oversight of financial institutions 
in addition  local regulations  primarily in japan  may apply heightened scrutiny to non domestic companies 
our international investments businesses are also impacted by regulatory changes implemented or proposed in many of the countries in which we operate 
competitive environment 
the life insurance markets in japan and korea are mature 
we generally compete more on service provided to the customers than on price 
the aging of japan s population creates an increasing need for product innovation  introducing insurance products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement 
in addition  several competitors have exited the life insurance business  creating greater opportunities for us to penetrate this market 
for our international investments operations  the competitive landscape is influenced by implemented or planned regulatory changes  particularly in mexico  taiwan and china 
current developments on february   prudential financial completed the acquisition from american international group  inc  or aig  of aig star life insurance co  ltd  or star  aig edison life insurance company  or edison  and certain other aig subsidiaries pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated september  between 
table of contents prudential financial and aig 
the total purchase price was approximately billion  comprised of approximately billion in cash and billion in assumed third party debt  substantially all of which is expected to be repaid  over time  with excess capital of the acquired entities 
to partially fund the acquisition purchase price  in november  prudential financial completed a public offering and sale of  shares of common stock and billion of medium term notes  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately billion

our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the following net income of our financial services businesses attributable to prudential financial  inc for the year ended december  was billion compared to billion for  which included a billion after tax gain from the sale of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities 
pre tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of the financial services businesses in were million  primarily reflecting other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities partially offset by net realized investment gains from increases in the market value of derivatives primarily related to interest rate derivatives used to manage investment portfolio duration and net gains related to the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain of our variable annuity contracts partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the financial services businesses amounted to billion as of december   compared to net unrealized gains of million as of december  gross unrealized gains increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  and gross unrealized losses decreased from billion to billion for the same periods primarily due to a net decrease in interest rates  mainly the result of risk free rates

table of contents outlook management expects that results in will continue to reflect the quality of our individual businesses and their prospects  as well as our overall business mix and effective capital management 
in  we continue to focus on long term strategic positioning and growth opportunities  including the following us retirement and investment management market 
we look to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods 
in addition  we continue to focus on our clients increasing needs for retirement income security given volatility in the financial markets 
we also look to provide products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and stretch their benefit dollars 
us insurance market 
we continue to focus on writing high quality business and expect to continue to benefit from expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third party distributors 
we also look to capitalize on opportunities for additional optional life purchases in the group insurance market  as institutional clients are focused on stretching their benefit dollars 
international markets 
we continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate  such as japan  and expanding our distribution capabilities  including through the integration of the recently acquired star and edison businesses 
we look to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and public policy have resulted in a growing demand for retirement income and protection products similar to those offered in the us 
table of contents results of operations we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations segment measures for a discussion of adjusted operating income  including the change we made to this measure in the third quarter of  and its use as a measure of segment operating performance 
shown below are the contributions of each segment and corporate and other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended december   and and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and corporate and other operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures

table of contents asset management segment results improved in in comparison to primarily from improved results from the segment s commercial mortgage and proprietary investing activities and increased asset management fees 
individual life segment results declined in compared to including million from changes in mortality experience compared to expected levels 
the current year included slightly unfavorable mortality experience  net of reinsurance relative to expected levels  compared to favorable mortality experience in the prior year 
results in also reflect an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  reflecting the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods  partially offset by the favorable impact of variable life policyholder persistency 
also contributing to the decline was a million benefit in from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  compared to a benefit of less than million in group insurance segment results declined in  compared to results in reflect the net benefit from reserve refinements in both the group life and group disability businesses  including the impact from annual reviews  compared to a net benefit of zero in excluding this item  the decrease in adjusted operating income primarily reflects less favorable group life underwriting results due largely to the lapse of certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal with favorable claims experience in the prior year  reflecting the competitive market  as well as an increase in the number and severity of claims 
results in also reflect less favorable long term disability claims experience consistent with the economic downturn 
in addition  operating expenses increased  including higher costs to support disability operations and expansion into the group dental market 
international insurance segment results for improved from results from the segment s life planner operations improved in  reflecting the continued growth of our japanese life planner operation  partially offset by the comparative impact of a net charge in and a net benefit to results in from refinements due to implementation of a new policy valuation system 
results from the segment s gibraltar life operation included a pre tax gain of million related to shares sold by a consortium of investors that holds a minority interest in china pacific insurance group co  ltd 
the remainder of the improvements in results in came primarily from continued growth in our fixed annuity products  which are primarily denominated in us dollars  and from business growth in protection products reflecting expanding bank channel distribution  as well as a greater contribution from non coupon investments 
international investments segment results for improved from primarily reflecting more favorable sales and trading results in the segment s global commodities operations 
corporate and other operations resulted in an increased loss for as compared to primarily due to increased interest expense  reflecting a greater level of capital debt  as well as less favorable results from corporate hedging activities and a higher level of expenses in other corporate activities  partially offset by improved results in our real estate and relocation services business

table of contents accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
deferred policy acquisition and other costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs primarily include commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses that are incurred in producing new business 
in addition  we also defer costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our individual annuities segment 
sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract 
for additional information about sales inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and deferred sales inducements  or dsi  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as described in more detail below  in calculating dac and dsi amortization  we are required to make assumptions about investment returns  mortality  persistency  and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums 
as of december   dac and dsi in our financial services businesses were billion and billion  respectively  and dac in our closed block business was million 
amortization methodologies dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
we also evaluate the recoverability of the dac balance at the end of each reporting period 
many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders 
dac adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  changes in gross margins and dac amortization could result in greater volatility in the closed block business results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the non participating whole life  term life  endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant deterioration in future experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related dac 

table of contents dac and dsi associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments are amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits 
dac and dsi are also subject to recoverability testing which we perform at the end of each reporting period to ensure that each balance does not exceed the present value of estimated gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits 
total gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions  our quarterly adjustments for current period experience  and our quarterly adjustments for market performance 
each of these adjustments is further discussed below in annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments 
in addition to the gross profit components mentioned above  we also include the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization 
historically  we also included the impact of these embedded derivatives and related hedging activities  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  in our estimate of total gross profits used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy  which resulted in a change in how certain gross profit components are used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
historically  as part of our hedging strategy  we sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  with capital market derivatives and options 
under our new hedging strategy  our hedge target continues to be grounded in a gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the risk free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk 
the modifications include the removal of a volatility risk margin embedded in the valuation technique used to fair value the embedded derivative liability under gaap  and the inclusion of a credit spread over the risk free rate used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds 
for a discussion of the change in our hedging strategy and the results of our hedging program  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions 
as mentioned above  this change in our hedging strategy also led to a change in the components included in our estimate of total gross profits used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
as of the third quarter of  management s best estimate of the total gross profits associated with these optional living benefit features and related hedge positions is based on the updated hedge target definition as described above 
however  total gross profits for these purposes includes the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value only to the extent this net amount is determined by management to be other than temporary  as well as the impact of assumption updates on the valuation of the hedge target liability 
the determination of whether the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value is other than temporary is based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge program 
management generally expects differences between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value to be temporary and to reverse over time 
such differences would not be included in total gross profits for purposes of determining the amortization rates 
however  based on the effectiveness of the hedge program  management may determine that the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and the asset value is other than temporary and would include that amount in management s best estimate of total gross profits for setting the dac and dsi amortization rates 
management may also decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from the target hedge definition  given overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing market conditions 
the impact from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from the hedge target definition  as well as the results of the capital hedge program we began in the second quarter of and modified in  are not considered in calculating total gross profits used to determine amortization rates nor included in actual gross profits used in calculating current period amortization 

table of contents annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments annually  during the third quarter  we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods 
although we review these assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year  we generally only update these assumptions and adjust the dac and dsi balances during the third quarter  unless a material change that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac and dsi have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions  mortality  and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
we expect these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause potential significant changes in the future 
the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change 
in these cases  we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods amortization  also referred to as an experience true up adjustment 
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance 
a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and  to a lesser degree  our variable life policies are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances  which increase the fees we earn and decrease the costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts  resulting in higher expected future gross profits and lower dac and dsi amortization for the period 
the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations 
the near term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac and dsi for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the projected future rate of return over the four year period is greater than our maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum future rate of return 
as of december   our long term expected rates of return across all asset types for variable annuity contracts and variable life policies range from to per annum  depending on the specific block of business  and reflect  among other assumptions  an expected rate of return of per annum for equity type assets and a annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments 
unless there is a sustained interim deviation  our long term expected rate of return assumptions generally are not impacted by short term market fluctuations 
as of december   our near term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach for variable annuity contracts and variable life policies was and per annum  respectively 
included in this blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a annual maximum rate of return on equity investments and a annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments 
we update the projected future rate of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach 
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization  reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods gross profits 
the new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
for domestic variable annuities contracts and domestic variable life policies  as of december   our expected rate of return for the next four years across all asset types is and per annum  respectively 
these rates represent a weighted average of our expected rates of return across all contract groups 
for some contract groups  our expected rate of return for the next four years equals our current maximum future rates of return  as the near term 
table of contents projected future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach is greater than our maximum future rate of return 
for certain contract groups relating to variable annuities issued in and  the expected rate of return over the next four years is under per annum  reflecting the impact of more favorable markets in and and the reversion to the mean approach 
sensitivity for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
for the variable and universal life policies in our international insurance segment  mortality assumptions impact to a lesser extent our estimates of future gross profits due to differences in policyholder demographics  the overall age of this block of business  the amount of mortality margins and our actual mortality experience 
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by

for variable annuity contracts  dac and dsi are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
the dac and dsi balances associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts were billion and billion  respectively  as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points

valuation of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi  we also recognize an asset for valuation of business acquired  or voba 
as of december   voba was million  all within our financial services businesses 
voba represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired businesses  and is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition 
we have established a voba asset primarily for our acquired traditional life  deferred annuity  defined contribution and defined benefit businesses 
voba is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts 
for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba is also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits 
based on this recoverability testing  in we impaired the entire remaining voba asset related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
for additional information regarding this charge  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not 
the test is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments 
reporting units that had goodwill subject to testing as of december  were the asset management segment  the international insurance segment s life planners business and the retirement segment s full service business 
as required by accounting guidance  the impairment testing process consists of two steps 
step requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be calculated and compared to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value  it is concluded there is no impairment and the analysis is complete 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step of the process is completed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
step utilizes business combination purchase accounting guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill  but including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to the reporting unit s total fair value as calculated in step the excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the fair value of reporting units calculated in step was determined using either an earnings multiple approach or a discounted cash flow approach 
the earnings multiple approach was the primary approach for the asset management and international insurance reporting units 
the discounted cash flow approach was primarily utilized by the retirement reporting unit 
earnings multiples used ranged from to times earnings while the discount rate used was 
the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
each comparable company is analyzed based on various 
table of contents factors  including  but not limited to  financial risk  size  geographic diversification  profitability  adequate financial data  and an actively traded stock price 
a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts consensus estimates for each company s forecasted earnings 
the multiple is then applied to the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value 
a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the weighted average rate of return  or warr  represents the required rate of return on total capitalization 
it is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax affected cost of debt  which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt in the capital structure 
to estimate the return on equity  we applied the capital asset pricing model  or capm 
the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor s return requirement  and hence a company s cost of equity capital 
capm is determined by beginning with the long term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility  small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company 
the warr calculation is applied to a group of companies considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit 
after completion of step of the analysis  it was determined that fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of the three reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of december  the asset management and international insurance life planner businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively 
the fair value of the retirement full service business  which was calculated based upon application of the discounted cash flow approach utilizing a discount rate of  exceeded the carrying value by 
as of december   we had a total goodwill balance of million  including million related to our retirement reporting unit  million related to our asset management reporting unit  and million related to our international insurance reporting unit 
further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses  or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses  could result in goodwill impairments  resulting in a charge to income 
during  we recorded a total impairment charge for goodwill of million  which was included in general and administrative expenses 
these impairments reflected the deterioration of financial conditions in and the impact of this deterioration on expected future earnings of these businesses  including for our individual annuities reporting unit  equity market declines and resulting additional market depreciation within separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our anticipated future fee income  for our international investments reporting unit  significant market deterioration resulting in both a reduction in value and an outflow of assets under management which contributed to lower asset management fees earned in the fourth quarter of and expected in future periods and for our prudential real estate and relocation reporting unit  further deterioration of the us housing market  including the number of transactions and the national average home sale price which both declined in the fourth quarter of  and the impact of this decline on future anticipated revenues of this business 
valuation of investments  including derivatives  and the recognition of other than temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities  other invested assets  and derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the values of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps  futures  forwards and options and may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market 
we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
management believes the following accounting policies related to investments  including derivatives  are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives  as referenced below

policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by us gaap 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used 
table of contents are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
these gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in the closed block business results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with us gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net us gaap liabilities us  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net us gaap liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
unless a material change in mortality experience is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
although we review our mortality and retirement assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year  we generally only updates these assumptions annually during the third quarter unless a material change in mortality or retirement experience is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the remaining of the reserves for future policy benefits as of december  represented reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment  and group life and disability and long term care benefits in our group insurance segment 
the optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives  with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 

table of contents in establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuity contracts  we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization  contract lapses and contractholder mortality  as well as interest rates and equity market returns 
assumptions relating to contractholder behavior  such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses  are based on our experience by contract group  and vary by product type and year of issuance 
our dynamic lapse rate assumption applies a different lapse rate on a contract by contract basis based on a comparison of the guaranteed minimum death or income benefit and the current policyholder account value as well as other factors such as the applicability of any surrender charges 
in the money contracts are those with a guaranteed minimum benefit in excess of the current policyholder account value 
since in the money contracts are less likely to lapse  we apply a lower lapse rate assumption to these contracts 
as an example  the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are not in the money and are out of their surrender charge period average between and per year  and the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are in the money and are out of their surrender charge period average between and per year 
mortality assumptions are generally based on our historical experience or standard industry tables  and also vary by contract group 
unless a material change in contractholder behavior or mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update assumptions related to contractholder behavior and mortality in the third quarter of each year by considering the actual results that have occurred during the period from the most recent update to the expected amounts 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates that have resulted in changes to our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and can also impact our dac and other balances as discussed above 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuity contracts are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
for additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see  deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit  or gmdb and gmib  related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change in the reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of the reserves  or any changes on dac or other balances  discussed above in deferred policy acquisition and other costs

table of contents unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion as of december  is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 
expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability 
we review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations annually 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
recently  our claim termination experience has been impacted by increased volatility driven by the economic downturn 
if actual experience results in a different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
unearned revenue reserves for universal life and investment contracts our unearned revenue reserve  or urr  reported as a component of policyholders account balances  is billion as of december  this reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our individual life segment and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product s estimated gross profits  similar to dac as discussed above 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
the urr balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
our assumed long term rate of return for was for our pension plans and for our other postretirement benefit plans 
given the amount of plan assets as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return

in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
at december   the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement obligations to a basis point change in discount rate was as follows december  increase decrease in pension benefits obligation increase decrease in accumulated postretirement benefits obligation increase in discount rate by basis points decrease in discount rate by basis points taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors  including the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  whether they are ordinary or capital  in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal  taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions  any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets  and any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
in  the company increased the valuation allowance against the state and local deferred tax assets for certain non insurance subsidiaries 
the increase of million to the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets established in and prior years 

table of contents our accounting represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate 
for example  the dividends received deduction  or drd  reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 
the us treasury department and the internal revenue service  or irs  intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
on february   the obama administration released the general explanations of the administration s revenue proposals 
although the administration has not released proposed statutory language  one proposal would change the method used to determine the amount of the drd 
a change in the drd  including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulation or legislation  could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income 
us gaap prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns 
the application of this guidance is a two step process  the first step being recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in of million 
our liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the irs or other taxing authorities 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
generally  for tax years which produce net operating losses  capital losses or tax credit carryforwards  or tax attributes  the statute of limitations does not close  to the extent of these tax attributes  until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
the statute of limitations for the tax year expired on april  the statute of limitations for the tax year expired on july  the statute of limitations for the through tax years will expire in february  unless extended 
tax years and are still open for irs examination 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact in of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has expired 
the company s affiliates in japan as well as korea file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority 
the general statute of limitations for japan and korea are five years from when the return is filed 
we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the status of our tax audits  including those of our international affiliates that file separate tax returns and are subject to the audits of the local taxing authority 

table of contents reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure

the holders of the common stock will benefit from the direct equity adjustment as long as reported administrative expenses of the closed block business are less than the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums 
generally  as statutory cash premiums and policies in force in the closed block business decline  we expect the benefit to the common stock holders from the direct equity adjustment to decline accordingly 
if the reported administrative expenses of the closed block business exceed the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement  the direct equity adjustment will reduce income available to holders of the common stock for earnings per share purposes

segment measures in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with authoritative guidance  is our measure of segment performance 
the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income 
effective with the third quarter of  we amended our definition of adjusted operating income as it relates to certain variable annuity contracts and defined contribution accounts that contain optional guaranteed living benefit features 
changes in the fair value of these optional living benefit features  which are accounted for as embedded derivatives  are primarily driven by changes in the policyholders account balance and changes in the capital market and policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  including equity market returns  interest rates  market volatility  benefit utilization  contract lapses  contractholder mortality  and withdrawal rates 
the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities 
table of contents also reflect an increase or decrease in the market perceived risk of our non performance 
we hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks associated with these living benefit features through a combination of product design elements and externally purchased hedging instruments 
in addition  beginning in the second quarter of  we expanded our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of the variable annuity business 
during the second quarter of  the equity component of the capital hedge within the variable annuity business was replaced with a new capital hedge program that more broadly addressed equity market exposure of the statutory capital within the financial services businesses as a whole 
changes in the value of the embedded derivatives inclusive of the market perceived risk of our non performance  and the related hedge positions are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
historically  adjusted operating income included the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives and related hedge positions  in the period they occurred  and also included the related impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
adjusted operating income under the amended definition excludes any amounts related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions  and the related impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform to the amended definition 
we view adjusted operating income under the amended definition as a more meaningful presentation of our results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of  and allocating resources to  our business segments  as the amended definition presents results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses 
the accounting for these products and associated derivatives under us gaap has not changed 
adjusted operating income under the amended definition excludes net gains of million  net gains of million  and net losses of million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions  and the related impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to  million in the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to an increase in fee income  net of higher distribution costs  driven by higher average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts due to positive net flows and net market appreciation 
partially offsetting the increase in adjusted operating income was a million lower benefit related to adjustments to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
as shown in the following table  adjusted operating income for included million of benefits from these adjustments  compared to million of benefits included in this variance is discussed in more detail below 
year ended december  year ended december  amortization of dac and other costs reserves for gmdb gmib total amortization of dac and other costs reserves for gmdb gmib total in millions quarterly market performance adjustment annual review assumption updates quarterly adjustment for current period experience and other updates total amounts reflect charges or benefits for increases or decreases  respectively  in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and other costs 
amounts reflect charges or benefits for reserve increases or decreases  respectively  related to the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit  or gmdb gmib  features of our variable annuity products 
the million of benefits for relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments shown in the table above are attributable to changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance 
the following table shows the actual quarterly rate of return on variable annuity account values for the four quarters of compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross profits 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter actual rate of return expected rate of return actual returns exceeded our expected returns for which increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  by establishing a new  higher starting point for the 
table of contents variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods 
the expected rates of return in for some contract groups were based upon our maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach  as discussed below 
the overall increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions  which are applied to all prior periods 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions was a million benefit for as shown in the table above 
the million of benefits for relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments is attributable to a similar impact on gross profits of market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  reflecting financial market conditions during the period 
the benefit in is higher than that in due to a greater difference in between the actual rates of return and the expected rates of return  which are detailed further below 
also  the million decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs in is net of a million charge to impair the entire remaining balance of valuation of business acquired  or voba  related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate in the second quarter of the additional charge was required in the first quarter of  as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero 
since the voba balance was completely amortized for these contracts  it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods 
as discussed and shown in the table above  results for both periods also include the impact of the annual reviews of the assumptions used in the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
included million of benefits from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in lapse rate assumptions and more favorable assumptions relating to fee income 
included million of charges from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in the future rate of return assumptions applied to the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products 
partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions for were benefits related to the impact of lower mortality and higher investment spread assumptions 
as mentioned above  we derive our near term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets are projected to grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
the near term future projected return across all contract groups is per annum as of december   or per quarter 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of  the projected near term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for some contract groups was greater than our maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
in those cases  we utilize the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits 
the near term blended maximum future rate of return  for these impacted contract groups  under the reversion to the mean approach is at the end of included in the blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments and a annual maximum rate of return on equity investments 
further or continued market volatility could result in additional market value changes within our separate account assets and corresponding changes to our gross profits  as well as additional adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
given that the estimates of future gross profits are based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption for some contract groups  all else being equal  future rates of return higher than the above mentioned future projected four year return of  but less than the maximum future rate of return of  may still result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
the million benefit for and the million benefit for for the quarterly adjustments for current period experience and other updates shown in the table above primarily reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and 
table of contents income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change  and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods amortization  also referred to as an experience true up adjustment  may be required in the current period 
this adjustment to previous periods amortization is in addition to the direct impact of actual gross profits on current period amortization and the market performance related adjustment to our estimates of gross profits for future periods 
the experience true up adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs for reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits  resulting primarily from higher than expected fee income 
the adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products in primarily reflects a reserve decrease driven by lower than expected actual contract guarantee claim costs  more favorable lapse experience  and higher than expected fee income

these adjustments primarily reflect the market conditions that existed in the respective periods  and the estimated impact of those market conditions on contractholder behavior  and are discussed individually in more detail below 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in fee income  driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the declines in average separate account assets were due to market depreciation and transfers of balances to the general account 
the transfer of balances to our general account relates to an automatic rebalancing element  also known as an asset transfer feature  in some of our optional living benefit features  which  as part of the overall product design  transferred approximately billion out of the separate accounts and into the fixed rate account in our general account from january  through march   due to equity market declines 
subsequently  in the remainder of  approximately billion was returned from the fixed rate account in our general account to the separate accounts by operation of the automatic rebalancing element due to market improvements 
higher average annuity account values in investments backed by our general account resulting from these transfers also led to improved investment results  which offset the decrease in fee income

the previously expected rate of return for  for most contract groups  was based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption under the reversion to the mean approach 
the increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions  which are applied to all prior periods 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions are recognized in the current period 
the  million charge in is attributable to a similar but opposite impact on gross profits of market value decreases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  reflecting financial market conditions during the period

in addition  the million decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs for is net of a million charge to impair the entire remaining voba balance related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
the additional charge was required in the first quarter of  as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero 
since the voba balance was completely impaired for these contracts  it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods 
as shown in the table above  results for both periods include the impact of the annual reviews of the assumptions used in the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs

partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions were benefits related to the impact of lower mortality and higher investment spread assumptions 
adjusted operating income for included million of charges from these annual reviews  primarily reflecting increased cost of expected income and death benefit claims due to lower expected lapse rates for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience shown in the table above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products

revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from  million in to  million in policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income increased million primarily due to higher average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the increase in average separate account asset balances was due to positive net flows  net market appreciation  and net transfers of balances from the general account to the separate accounts during the transfer of balances from the general account relates to both transfers from a customer elected dollar cost averaging program of approximately billion and approximately billion of net transfers primarily from the automatic rebalancing element  also referred to as an asset transfer feature  in some of our optional living benefit features 
the automatic rebalancing element is part of the overall product design  and as a result of market improvements  transferred balances out of the fixed rate account in our general account to the separate accounts during premiums also increased million driven by an increase in annuitizations primarily from contracts with the guaranteed minimum income benefit feature 
partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a decrease in net investment income of million  reflecting lower average annuity account values in the general account also resulting from transfers from the fixed rate account in the general account to the separate accounts as discussed above

to annual comparison total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to billion as of december   representing an increase of billion from december  the increase was driven by positive variable annuity net flows and increases in the market value of customers variable annuities due to favorable equity markets for individual variable annuity gross sales momentum continued in as sales increased by billion  from billion in to billion in the increase reflects our product strength  customer value proposition  and position as the primary provider of living benefit guarantees based on highest daily customer account value as well as the further expansion of our distribution networks 
additionally  we have benefited from some of our competitors implementing product modifications to increase pricing and scale back product features due to market disruptions in late and the first half of although we have implemented similar modifications  we believe that our product offerings have remained competitively positioned and expect our living benefit features will provide us an attractive risk and profitability profile  as all of our currently offered optional living benefit features include the automatic rebalancing element described below 
individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals increased by billion  from billion in to billion in  reflecting the overall impact of higher account values in the current year due to market appreciation over the past twelve months 
to annual comparison total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to billion as of december   an increase of billion from december  the increase came primarily from increases in the market value of customers variable annuities due to equity market appreciation and from positive variable annuity net flows 
individual variable annuity gross sales increased by billion  from billion in to billion in the increase reflects a benefit from the impact of market disruptions on some of our competitors  certain of which implemented product modifications to increase pricing and scale back product features in the second and third quarters of we also experienced increased sales in the third quarter of related to certain optional living benefit features which we previously announced would be discontinued during the third quarter of individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals decreased by billion  from billion in to billion in  reflecting the overall impact of lower account values in the first half of due to market depreciation and lower lapses for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death or living benefit value 
variable annuity net amount at risk as a result of the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets  in recent years we have seen significant volatility in the net amounts at risk embedded in our variable annuity products with riders that include optional living and guaranteed minimum death benefit features 
the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder s current account balance 
as part of our risk management strategy  we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the risks associated with our variable annuity products primarily through a combination of product design elements  such as an automatic rebalancing element  and externally purchased hedging instruments 
our hedging programs are discussed below in net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions and capital hedge program 
the rate of return we realize from our variable annuity contracts can vary by contract based on our risk management strategy  including the impact on any capital markets movements that we may hedge  the impact on that portion of our variable annuity contracts that benefit from the automatic rebalancing element  and the impact of risks that are not able to be hedged 
the automatic rebalancing element  included in the design of certain optional living benefits  transfers assets between the variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and  depending on the benefit feature  the fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account 
the transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors  including the impact of investment performance on the contractholder s total account value 
in general  negative investment performance may result in transfers to either the fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account  and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to

overall  the automatic rebalancing element is designed to help mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility 
beginning in  our offerings of optional living benefit features associated with currently sold variable annuity products all include an automatic rebalancing element  and in we discontinued any new sales of optional living benefit features without an automatic rebalancing element 
variable annuity account values with living benefit features were billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively

net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as mentioned above  in addition to our automatic rebalancing element  we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs 
in our living benefit hedging program  we purchase equity options and futures as well as interest rate derivatives to hedge certain living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in equity markets  interest rates  and market volatility 
historically  our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  with capital market derivatives and options 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy as  in the low interest rate environment  we do not believe the gaap value of the embedded derivative liability to be an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target 
our new hedge target continues to be grounded in a gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the risk free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk 
the modifications include the removal of a volatility risk margin embedded in the valuation technique used to fair value the embedded derivative liability under gaap  and the inclusion of a credit spread over the risk free rate used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds 
this new strategy will result in differences each period between the change in the value of the embedded derivative liability as defined by gaap and the change in the value of the hedge positions  potentially increasing volatility in gaap earnings 
in addition  consistent with sound risk management practices  we evaluate hedge levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition 
because this decision is based on the overall capital considerations of the company as a whole  the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition is reported through corporate and other operations 
historically  adjusted operating income included the net impact of both the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities associated with our living benefit features and the change in fair value of the related derivative hedge positions  as well as the related impact to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
in light of management s decision to change the hedge target  as discussed above  in the third quarter of  we amended our definition of adjusted operating income to exclude changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities and the related derivative hedge positions  as well as the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the net impact of both the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities associated with our living benefit features and the change in fair value of the related derivative hedge positions are included in realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments and the related impact to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs is included in related charges 
see consolidated results of operations segment measures for additional information 

table of contents the following table shows the net impact of changes in the embedded derivative liabilities  as defined by gaap  and hedge positions  as well as the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  for the years ended december   and for the individual annuities segment

represents the impact from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition 
as of december   our adjustment for the market s perception of our own risk of non performance resulted in a million decrease to the embedded derivative liability 
net benefit charge from the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions are excluded from adjusted operating income and included in operating results in realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments 
related benefit charge to amortization of dac and other costs is excluded from adjusted operating income and included in operating results in related charges 
in  the net impact from the mark to market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions for the individual annuities segment was a benefit of million partially offset by a million increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs resulting from the corresponding impact to current period gross profits 
excluding the updates of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  which are discussed below  and excluding the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  the hedging activities resulted in a million net benefit in for the individual annuities segment 
million of the million net benefit in is attributable to the difference between the change in the target hedge liability and the change in the fair value of the liability as defined by gaap 
as described above  because the value of our new hedge target does not equal the value of embedded derivative liability as defined by gaap  our net hedging results will be impacted each period by the difference between the changes in the two values 
the remaining million of the million net benefit is primarily driven by results prior to the implementation of our new hedging strategy related to differences in the actual performance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilized as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
given the sensitivity of the fair value of the embedded derivative to current financial market conditions as well as the new hedging strategy which targets a liability different from that defined by gaap  differences between the fair value of the embedded derivative as defined by gaap and related hedge positions for a given period will be largely dependent on the financial market conditions throughout the period

as shown above  the net impact from the mark to market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions for also includes the impact of updates to the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a million charge 
this charge represents an increase to the embedded 
table of contents derivative liability primarily driven by reductions in the expected lapse rate assumption based on evolving experience 
additionally  beginning in  we include an adjustment to the embedded derivative liability to reflect the market s perception of our own risk of non performance 
to reflect the market s perception of our own risk of non performance  we incorporate an additional spread over libor into the discount rate used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities 
this additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to those embedded derivatives in a liability position and not to those in a contra liability position 
for additional information regarding the methodology for calculating the impact of the market perceived risk of our non performance  see valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 
as shown in the table above  includes a million benefit related to this adjustment primarily resulting from an increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives in a liability position reflecting an increase in the present value of future expected benefit payments driven by lower interest rates as well as a reduction in the expected lapse rate assumption 
in and  the net impact from the mark to market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions was a benefit of million and a net charge of million  respectively 
a corresponding impact to current period gross profits related to these impacts led to an offsetting increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs of million in and a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs of million in excluding the updates of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  which are discussed below and excluding the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  the hedging activities resulted in a million benefit in and a million charge in variances for both periods are primarily driven by differences in the actual performance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilize as a basis for developing our hedging strategy

capital hedge program in the second quarter of  we began the expansion of our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business  including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures 
these capital hedges  which primarily consisted of equity based total return swaps  were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products 
during the second quarter of  we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the individual annuities segment by terminating the equity based total return swaps  as part of a new program to more broadly address the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the company as a whole  under stress scenarios 
since the new program incorporates capital implications across a number of businesses  the results of that program are reported within corporate and other operations 
consequently  see corporate and other for a discussion of the results of the current program 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries for a further discussion of the capital hedge program 
the results of the individual annuities segment for included million of mark to market losses on these capital hedges prior to their termination

on october   we acquired mullintbg insurance agency services  llc and related entities  or mullintbg  a provider of executive benefit solutions and financing strategies  including nonqualified executive deferred compensation plans 
the acquisition included billion of nonqualified full service retirement account values that we administer  which are not reported on our balance sheet 
in the third quarter of  we amended our definition of adjusted operating income to exclude the net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as well as market value changes of derivatives used in our capital hedge program 
adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform with the amended definition 
see consolidated results of operations segment measures for additional information 
adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting higher asset based fee income and improved net investment spread results partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  and a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements 
each item is further discussed below 
higher asset based fees were driven by an increase in average full service fee based retirement account values and higher fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business 
the increase in average full service fee based retirement account values was driven by market appreciation and net additions 
higher fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business were driven by net additions due to our market positioning 
improved net investment spread results were driven by lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business and increased income from equity method investments driven by mark to market gains 
table of contents in compared to mark to market losses in lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business resulted from rate resets in the third quarter of and first quarter of our ability to maintain current net spreads in our full service business in future periods is impacted by the levels of interest rates  the pace and extent of changes in interest rates  competitor pricing  and the minimum guaranteed crediting rates on our general account stable value products 
also contributing to the increase in net investment spread results were increased net settlements on floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio 
the increase in net swap settlements resulted from the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on the swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio primarily for our institutional investment products business 
as we continued to manage the duration gap between assets and liabilities within our risk management framework  the use of interest rate swaps to increase the duration of the investment portfolio  primarily in our institutional investment products business  grew in as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of swaps declined during  relative to the liabilities  as a result of purchases of fixed income securities with shorter durations than the durations of our liabilities and higher levels of cash and short term investments 
although the notional amounts of these swaps on average for are relatively unchanged from  the amounts have declined in the latter half of as lower levels of cash and short term investments and purchases of fixed income securities with durations more closely matched to our liabilities reduced the duration gap between our assets and liabilities 
future net investment spread results could be impacted if interest rates or the notional amounts of these swaps change 
partially offsetting the improvement in net investment spread results was the negative impact of a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled withdrawals from guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business partially offset by the positive impact of net additions in our structured settlement product and increases in balances in our full service general account stable value products 
if we are unable to replace scheduled withdrawals of guaranteed investment products  including gics  funding agreements  retail notes  and institutional notes  with new additions  net investment spread results in future periods may be negatively impacted 
for further discussion of our sales  see sales results and account values 
partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was an increase in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  driven by expenses incurred in related to certain cost reduction initiatives 
also partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements  primarily due to a benefit in related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business 
results for both and also include the impact of an annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired  as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience 
adjusted operating income for and included charges of million and million  respectively  from the annual reviews 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience resulted in an million benefit in compared to a million charge in  reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period 
together  these items resulted in net charges included in adjusted operating income of million for and million in the net charge of million in was driven by changes in lapse rate and fee based profit margin assumptions which both decreased expected future gross profits 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from million in to million in results for both periods include the impact of an annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired  as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience 
adjusted operating income for included a million charge from the annual review  compared to a million charge in the charge in primarily reflected a decrease in our estimate of future gross profits  including a decline in our asset based profit assumptions and an increase in our expense assumptions 
the quarterly updates for actual experience resulted in a million of charge in and a million benefit in  reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period 
in addition  included a million benefit from a reduction in the amortization of valuation of business acquired due to a cumulative adjustment relating to the calculation of actual and expected gross profits 
together  these items resulted in a net charge of million in and a net benefit of million in 
table of contents excluding the items discussed above  adjusted operating income decreased million compared to reflecting a decrease in adjusted operating income for our institutional investment products business and relatively unchanged adjusted operating income in our full service business 
the decrease in our institutional investment products business primarily reflects a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements of million  primarily due to a smaller benefit in related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business  as well as less favorable case experience related to our group annuity blocks of business 
partially offsetting this decrease were improved net investment spread results and a favorable variance in the mark to market of equity investments required in certain of our separate account products 
the increase in net investment spread results was primarily due to increased net settlements on interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio  and the impact of the maturity of a single large guaranteed investment contract which had an interest crediting rate substantially in excess of our general account invested asset yield 
the increase in net swap settlements resulted from a higher notional amount of swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio and the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on those swaps 
as we continued to manage the duration gap between assets and liabilities within our risk management framework  the use of interest rate swaps to increase the duration of the investment portfolio grew in as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of swaps declined 
the investment portfolio duration had generally declined relative to the liabilities as a result of purchases of fixed income securities with shorter duration than the duration of our liabilities and higher levels of short term investments discussed below 
partially offsetting these increases in investment results was a lower benefit from the accretion into net investment income of fixed maturity other than temporary impairments recognized in previous periods 
such accretion did not contribute to results for due to our adoption of new authoritative guidance related to fixed maturity other than temporary impairments on january  also serving as partial offsets were a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled withdrawals of our guaranteed investment products and lower yields  including the impact of declining short term interest rates and a higher balance of investments in lower yielding assets  such as cash and short term investments  for liquidity purposes 
higher levels of short term liquidity were maintained in to provide additional capacity to address changing cash needs in light of market conditions during that period 
results of our full service business in compared to benefited from improved net investment spread results  driven by higher net yields due to the impact of lower crediting rates on general account liabilities  resulting from rate resets  as well as higher average invested assets in our general account reflecting full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products 
serving to mostly offset these increases were lower asset based fees  due to a decrease in average full service fee based retirement account values  primarily resulting from equity market depreciation and full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products  as well as fee concessions made to certain existing clients 
although account value declines in and early due to equity market depreciation were partially offset by large plan sales  in some instances these cases provide for more limited product offerings than existing business  and consequently a lower contribution to asset based fees 
revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from  million in to  million in premiums increased million  driven by higher life contingent structured settlement and single premium annuity sales which resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders benefits  including the change in policy reserves  as discussed below 
policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income increased million  primarily driven by an increase in asset based fees due to an increase in average full service fee based retirement account values and an increase in fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business  as well as increased income from net settlements on interest rate swaps  as discussed above 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in net investment income  primarily reflecting a smaller base of invested assets resulting from scheduled withdrawals of our general account guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business  and lower portfolio yields  including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in net investment income from an increase in income on equity method investments as discussed above 

table of contents to annual comparison 
revenues decreased million  from  million in to  million in net investment income decreased million  primarily reflecting lower portfolio yields  including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets and the impact of a higher balance of investments in lower yielding assets  such as cash and short term investments  for liquidity purposes  as discussed above 
also contributing to the decline in net investment income was a smaller base of invested assets related to our guaranteed investment products  due to maturities  and a lower benefit from the accretion into net investment income of fixed maturity other than temporary impairments recognized in previous periods  as discussed above 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in net investment income from a larger base of invested assets in our full service business  primarily driven by participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products  and a favorable variance in the mark to market of equity investments required in certain of our separate account products 
partially offsetting the decline in net investment income was a million increase in policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income  primarily relating to higher net settlements on interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio  as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase in policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income was a million increase in revenues associated with the acquired operations of mullintbg 
partially offsetting these increases in policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income was a decline in asset based fees in our full service business driven by a decrease in average full service fee based retirement account values  primarily resulting from equity market depreciation and full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products  as well as fee concessions made to certain existing clients  partially offset by large plan sales  as discussed above 
in addition  premiums increased million  driven by higher life contingent structured settlement sales  partially offset by lower single premium group annuity sales  which resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders benefits  including the change in policy reserves  as discussed below 
benefits and expenses to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from  million in to  million in policyholders benefits  including the change in policy reserves  increased million  primarily reflecting an increase in change in policy reserves associated with the increase in premiums and a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements  as discussed above 
also  general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  increased million primarily driven by higher commission expenses  net of capitalization  higher asset management costs due to an increase in average full service fee based retirement account values  and expenses incurred in related to certain cost reduction initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to policyholders account balances of million  primarily reflecting a smaller base of account values resulting from scheduled withdrawals of our general account guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business  lower crediting rates on floating rate guaranteed investment products  and lower crediting rates on full service stable value account values due to rate resets 
in addition  interest expense decreased million reflecting lower interest rates and lower borrowings used to support investments

benefits and expenses decreased million  from  million in to  million in absent the impact of the annual reviews and other adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired discussed above  which account for a million increase  benefits and expenses decreased million 
interest credited to policyholders account balances decreased million  primarily reflecting lower crediting rates on floating rate guaranteed investment products  the impact of maturities within our guaranteed investment products and lower crediting rates on full service stable value product liabilities due to rate resets  partially offset by the impact of higher full service general account stable value product account values due to participant transfers from equity based separate account and mutual fund products 
in addition  interest expense decreased million  reflecting lower interest rates and lower borrowings used to support investments 
partially offsetting these decreases  policyholders benefits  including the change in policy reserves  increased million  primarily reflecting a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements  as discussed above  and the increase in reserves associated with the increase in premiums discussed above  partially offset by lower interest on lower general account policy reserves 
general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  increased million

table of contents adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from million in to million in results in included a million benefit from lower amortization of net deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  as well as a decrease in reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature in certain contracts  reflecting updates of our actuarial assumptions based on an annual review  compared to a million benefit from the annual review in the annual reviews cover assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  as well as the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature in certain contracts 
results in also included a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute 
these compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiations periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive 
the largest of these arrangements was renegotiated in and the profit opportunities were reduced significantly in and beyond resulting in a benefit of less than million in absent the effect of these items  adjusted operating income in decreased million  including million from mortality experience  net of reinsurance  which was slightly unfavorable relative to expected levels in the current year  compared to favorable mortality experience in the prior year 
the decrease in adjusted operating income also reflects a million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  reflecting a net expense of million in compared to a net benefit of million in  resulting from changes in our estimates of total gross profits primarily from variable products arising from separate account fund performance and policyholder experience  which are described in more detail below 
this increase in amortization largely reflects the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods  partially offset by the impact of policyholder persistency which in returned to levels that are more consistent with expectations 
the decline in our in force block of variable life business also contributed to the decrease in adjusted operating income 
partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted operating income was higher net investment income from an increase in assets supporting our term and universal life products  growth in universal life policyholder account balances and the impact of gains in on investments in real property separate account funds compared to losses in the changes in our estimates of total gross profits arising from separate account fund performance  as discussed above  reflects the impact on our estimate of total gross profits of the difference between our actual quarterly rate of return on separate accounts compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return 
the following table shows the actual quarterly rate of return on separate accounts for the four quarters of compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross profits 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter actual rate of return expected rate of return the overall actual rate of return on separate account funds for was higher than our expected rate of return which resulted in a net decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves 
the overall higher than expected market returns in resulted in an increase in total future gross profits by establishing a higher starting point for the fund balances used in estimating those profits in future periods 
the increase in our estimate of total gross profits results in a lower required rate of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  partially offset by a lower required rate of amortization of unearned revenue reserves 
the overall actual rate of return on separate account funds for was also higher than our expected rate of return resulting in a similar impact on gross profits and a net decrease in amortization 
the benefit from lower amortization in was higher compared to due to a greater difference in between actual rates of return and expected rates of return 
the previously expected separate account fund performance was based on our future rate of return assumption under the reversion to the mean approach  as discussed below 
in addition  the net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  includes the impact of variable product policyholder persistency that results in differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period 
the current period includes a benefit from lower amortization of deferred 
table of contents policy acquisition costs  net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  reflecting better than expected gross profits driven by policyholder persistency which returned to levels that are more consistent with expectations  compared to an expense in  reflecting a similar but opposite impact from lower than expected policyholder persistency 
we derive our near term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the fourth quarter of  the projected near term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most variable policies was greater than our near term maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
in those cases  we utilized the near term maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits 
the near term blended maximum future rate of return under the reversion to mean approach was for included in the blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments and a annual maximum rate of return on equity investments 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of  the projected near term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most variable policies was lower than our near term maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
in those cases  we utilized the projected near term future rate of return over the four year period which was as of december  to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in the increase in adjusted operating income reflects improved earnings from variable products  which benefited from lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  driven by the impact of more favorable equity markets in on separate account fund performance 
separate account fund performance above expected levels results in an increase in total future gross profits on which the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves is based  and accordingly  lower amortization in the current period 
the prior year period contained higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of higher amortization of unearned revenue reserves in comparison to the current year  due to actual separate account performance that was below expected levels 
results in also benefited from gains on separate account fund liquidations associated with variable policy lapses and surrenders in compared to losses on these liquidations in due to policyholder options under some of the variable contracts  lapses may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this lag being borne by the company 
partially offsetting these items was the impact on variable product profitability of a decrease in asset based fees due to lower average separate account asset balances in reflecting the impact of the unfavorable equity markets in late and early  as well as expected runoff of older variable policies 
more favorable mortality experience  net of reinsurance  in compared to as well as higher earnings from growth in term and universal life insurance in force also contributed to the increase in adjusted operating income 
adjusted operating income for also includes a benefit of million from the annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves as well as for establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit features in certain contracts 
results for include a benefit of million from the annual assumption review 
in addition  results for include a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  while results for include a similar benefit of million 
these compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiation periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive 
the largest of these arrangements was revised effective in late the benefit of million in related to the annual review of assumptions reflects higher investment spread assumptions and improved future mortality expectations  partially offset by updates to interest rate assumptions which increased the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death benefit features in certain contracts 
in addition  the review of assumptions in reflects a reduction in our future rate of return assumption  which reduced the benefit to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization on unearned revenue reserves 
the benefit of million in primarily reflects improved future mortality expectations 
as mentioned above  we derive our near term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to

our group life business reflected greater benefit costs from less favorable claims experience  including an increase in benefits on retrospectively experience rated business that resulted in increased premiums  partially offset by the benefit of reserve refinements in and a decrease in policyholder benefits associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties 
our group disability business also reflected less favorable claims experience  partially offset by a decrease in policyholder benefits associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties 
also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher operating expenses  as discussed above 
the group life benefits ratio deteriorated percentage points from to  due to less favorable claims experience due to an increase in the number and severity of claims  as well as the lapse of certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal with favorable claims experience in  reflecting the competitive market  partially offset by the favorable impact of the reserve refinements

table of contents sales results the following table sets forth the group insurance segment s annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated 
in managing our group insurance business  we analyze annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap  because annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
year ended december  in millions annualized new business premiums group life group disability total amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies  from additional coverage under our servicemembers group life insurance contract and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts  and include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities 
includes long term care and dental products

total annualized new business premiums increased million  from million in to million in group life sales increased million driven primarily by increased large case sales to new customers  partially offset by lower premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties during group disability sales decreased million primarily due to lower sales of large case disability products to both new and existing customers  as well as a decrease in long term care sales

the operations of our international insurance and international investments segments are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar earnings from period to period even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
as discussed further below  we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  as well as dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams  thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements 
forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment and international investments segment  excluding the global commodities group  for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segments non us dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations executes forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings 
table of contents from the hedged currency in exchange for us dollars at specified exchange rates 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
this program is primarily associated with the international insurance segment s businesses in japan  korea and taiwan and the international investments segment s businesses in europe 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued our currency income hedging program associated with the international investment segment s businesses in korea  a result of our signing of a definitive agreement to sell prudential investment securities co  ltd 
and prudential asset management co  ltd  which together comprise our korean asset management operations 
as a result of the agreement  we have reflected results of our korean asset management operations  including the impact of this program  as discontinued operations for all periods reported 
this transaction closed on june  the intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations increased decreased revenues and adjusted operating income of each segment as follows for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions impact on revenues and adjusted operating income international insurance international investments total international insurance and investments division results of corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period  which includes the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings as a result of projected earnings differing from actual earnings 
the net impact of this program recorded within the corporate and other operations were gains of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these forward currency contracts were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  of which billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  related to our japanese insurance operations 
dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments in addition  our japanese insurance operations also hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans 
the principal of these dual currency investments are yen denominated while the related interest income is us dollar denominated 
these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollar interest income 
our japanese insurance operations also hold yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for us dollars at the yen us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
as of december  and  the notional amount of these investments was billion  or billion  and billion  or billion  respectively  based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired 
for the years ended december   and  the weighted average yield generated by these investments was  and  respectively 

table of contents presented below is the fair value of these instruments as reflected on our balance sheet at december in millions cross currency coupon swap agreements foreign exchange component of interest on dual currency investments total the table below presents as of december   the yen denominated earnings subject to our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments and the related weighted average exchange rates resulting from these investments

the present value of the earnings reflected in the table above  on a us dollar denominated basis  is billion as of december  the table above does not reflect the forward currency income hedging program discussed above 
in establishing the level of yen denominated earnings that will be hedged through the forward currency income hedging program we take into account the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as well as the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by us dollar denominated products and investments  which are discussed in greater detail below 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on equity hedges of us gaap equity and available economic capital we also seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies 
we continue to refine our current capital management framework  and as we further develop this framework  or as other events occur  we may alter this strategy 
available economic capital represents the excess of the fair value of assets over the fair value of liabilities for the current in force block of business 
in our japanese insurance operations we currently seek to hedge a portion of estimated available economic capital  including the amount attributable to the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations  which totaled billion as of december  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss components of equity and certain other adjustments 
we hedge a portion of the estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations through a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated assets 
these assets are financed with yen denominated liabilities and equity held in our japanese insurance operations 
in addition  we may also hedge estimated available economic capital using instruments held in our us domiciled entities  such as us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen 
in our taiwan insurance operation  the us gaap equity exposure is mitigated by holding a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated investments 
during  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of our korean operations due to a variety of considerations  including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from a strengthening korean won 
for the same reasons  during the third quarter of  we also terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure for all of our other foreign operations  excluding our japan and taiwan insurance operations 

table of contents as of december   the aggregate amount of the instruments serving as hedges of our estimated available economic capital  which includes the billion attributable to the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations discussed above  amounted to billion  unchanged from the amount hedged as of december  these instruments were principally comprised of available for sale us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion and held to maturity us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion held in our japanese insurance operations  as well as billion of net yen denominated liabilities held in our us domiciled entities  including a portion that has been converted to yen using swaps 
the effects of the yen denominated liabilities are reported in corporate and other operations 
these amounts do not reflect the forward currency income hedging program or dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above  which when added to the billion of instruments serving as an equity hedge of a portion of the estimated available economic capital  results in a total estimated available economic capital hedge of approximately billion as of december  in addition  as discussed below  we have billion of us dollar assets supporting us dollar liabilities related to us dollar denominated products issued by our japanese operations  which when added to the billion of total estimated available economic capital hedge  results in total us dollar instruments of approximately billion as of december  available for sale investments under us gaap are carried at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value except as described below for impairments  including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
changes in the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations due to foreign currency exchange rate movements are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a foreign currency translation adjustments  and can serve as an offset to the unrealized changes in fair value of the available for sale investments 
for the portion of available for sale investments that support our japanese insurance operations us gaap equity this offset creates a natural equity hedge 
for those us dollar denominated investments  including available for sale investments  that support the portion of estimated available economic capital above our us gaap equity there is no offsetting impact to equity 
in addition  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations is partially offset by foreign currency exchange related changes in designated yen denominated debt and other hedging instruments held in our us domiciled entities and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a foreign currency translation adjustments 
the investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  with the related change in value recorded within asset management fees and other income 
the remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these investments is excluded from adjusted operating income  as part of our application of the hedge of available economic capital 
the us dollar denominated investments that hedge a portion of our estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations pay a coupon  which is reflected within net investment income  and  therefore  included in adjusted operating income  which is approximately to basis points greater than what a similar yen based investment would pay 
the incremental impact of this higher yield on our us dollar denominated investments  as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above  will vary over time  and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investment  as well as interest rate environments in the us and japan at the time of the investment 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments investment results for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations 
for us dollar denominated investments recorded on the books of yen based entities  foreign currency exchange movements  including those reflected in the forward curve at the time of purchase of these investments will impact their value 
to the extent the value of the yen strengthens as compared to the us dollar  the value of these us dollar denominated investments will decrease as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
upon the ultimate sale or maturity of the us dollar denominated investments  any realized change in value related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the income statement and  excluded from adjusted operating income 
similarly  other than temporary impairments on these investments may include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which in certain circumstances will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the 
table of contents income statement  and  as such  excluded from adjusted operating income 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of our policies regarding impairments 
we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of our us dollar denominated investments and negatively impact the equity of our yen based entities by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries international insurance and investments subsidiaries for a discussion of our internal hedging strategies 
we also incorporate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the remaining us dollar denominated net asset position of our japanese insurance operations  which primarily relates to accrued investment income  as part of our overall application of the hedge of available economic capital 
these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  as they are non yen denominated items on the books of yen based entities  and the related change in value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
as these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are included in the determination of the japanese insurance operations level of available economic capital  we exclude all remeasurement related to these items from adjusted operating income 
in addition  as of december  and  our international insurance operations also had billion and billion  respectively  of foreign currency exposure from us dollar liabilities for us dollar denominated products issued by these operations 
a portion of these liabilities are coinsured to our us domiciled insurance operations and supported by us dollar denominated assets 
for the us dollar liabilities retained in japan  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments  including a significant portion that are designated as available for sale  and other related us dollar denominated net assets  primarily accrued investment income  to support these products 
the change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  or remeasurement  of the related us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these products is excluded from adjusted operating income 
international insurance the results of our international insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates  inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above 
to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment  where indicated below  we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to us dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented  including for constant dollar information discussed below 
the exchange rates used were japanese yen at a rate of yen per us dollar and korean won at a rate of won per us dollar 
in addition  for constant dollar information discussed below  activity denominated in us dollars is reported based on the amounts as transacted in us dollars

all acquired entities are japanese corporations and their businesses are in japan 
the acquired businesses distribute individual life insurance  group life insurance  group annuities  medical insurance  and fixed annuities primarily through captive agents  independent agents  and banks 
as of december   these businesses had approximately billion face amount of in force individual insurance and approximately  captive agents 
we anticipate that the invested assets attributed to these businesses will increase the invested assets of our japanese operations by about half 
the addition of these operations to our existing businesses will increase our scale in the japanese insurance market and provide complementary distribution opportunities 
we also expect these businesses to provide attractive returns primarily driven from in force business and cost synergies 
star and edison s bank channel distribution will be transferred and integrated with prudential gibraltar financial 
in addition  we expect to integrate the core operations of star and edison  excluding their bank channel distribution  with our gibraltar life operations by early  subject to local regulatory approvals 
we expect pre tax integration costs of approximately million to be incurred over a five year period  including approximately million during and after the integration is completed  we expect annual cost savings of approximately million 
actual integration costs may exceed  and actual costs savings may fall short of  such expectations 
acquisition of yamato life on may   our gibraltar life operations acquired yamato life  a japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in october gibraltar life served as the reorganization sponsor for yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired yamato by contributing million of capital to yamato

to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income from life planner operations increased million  from  million in to  million in  including a net unfavorable impact of million from currency fluctuations 
this increase in adjusted operating income primarily reflects the continued growth of our japanese life planner operation  as well as more favorable mortality experience and improved investment income margins 
the improved investment income margins primarily reflect investment portfolio growth in our us dollar denominated products in japan 
in addition  adjusted operating income benefited by million in due to the migration to a new policy valuation system that resulted in favorable refinements in the current year 
partially offsetting these items was increased general and administrative expenses due primarily to million of expenses recorded in related to an on going initiative in japan to enhance our information processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs

partially offsetting these favorable variances in premiums was a decrease of million  reflecting the completion of the special dividend arrangement in the second quarter of established as part of gibraltar life s reorganization in 
table of contents substantially all of the premiums recognized as additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were offset by a corresponding charge to increase reserves for the affected policies 
also contributing to the increase in revenues is favorable investment income reflecting the continued growth of our fixed annuity products and higher other income primarily reflecting the pre tax gain of million related to the partial sale of our indirect investment in china pacific insurance group co  ltd discussed above 
due to the long term nature of many of the products we sell in japan  we have historically sought to increase the duration of our japanese yen investment portfolio by employing various strategies  including investing in longer term securities or  by entering into long duration floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
these strategies better support the characteristics of our long dated product liabilities and have resulted in higher portfolio yields 
based on an evaluation of market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  we terminated or offset many of these interest rate swaps in consideration of  among other things  the interest rate environment 
the resulting realized investment gains from terminating or offsetting these interest rate swaps will be recognized in adjusted operating income over periods that generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives 
for  and  we recognized gains of million  gains of million  and losses of million  respectively  in adjusted operating income related to these realized investment gains losses 
as of december   million of deferred gains remain to be recognized in adjusted operating income over a weighted average period of years 
we continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities  and will implement these hedging strategies to lengthen the duration of our japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions dictates 
as we do so  the impact to our portfolio yields will depend on the then current interest rate environment

investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
authorities in some jurisdictions regulate interest rates guaranteed in our insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products sold in japan  other than those sold by gibraltar life  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables 
our mortality and morbidity experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended december   and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

the loss from corporate and other operations  on an adjusted operating income basis  increased million  from million in to million in the loss from corporate operations increased million  from million in to million in capital debt interest expense increased million due to a greater level of capital debt  which includes the issuance in september of million of exchangeable surplus notes  and reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes beginning in the second quarter of  as well as the deployment of additional corporate borrowings for capital purposes 
investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense  decreased million 
higher levels of short term liquidity have been maintained throughout and to provide additional flexibility to address our cash needs in view of changing financial market conditions 
the need to hold higher levels of short term liquidity  coupled with a portion of the proceeds from the sale at the end of of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities  will result in higher than historical levels of cash and short term investments in corporate and other until such time as capital is deployed to our business segments or invested longer term

table of contents net investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase of substantially all of our convertible senior notes during also contributing to the greater loss from corporate operations in compared to the prior year are greater net charges from other corporate activities  primarily reflecting less favorable results from corporate hedging activities  increased corporate advertising expenses and other retained corporate expenses 
results from corporate operations pension income and employee benefits decreased million 
the decrease reflects increases in employee benefits costs partially offset by an increase in income from our qualified pension plan 
income from our qualified pension plan increased million  from million in to million in for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will decrease the discount rate to from in the expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to in from in and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 
we determined our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors  we expect on a consolidated basis income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in  but at a level of about million to million lower than that of the year other postretirement benefit expenses will increase in a range of million to million 
the increase is driven primarily by the change in the expected rate of return on plan assets from to  demographic updates  and a change in the discount rate from to 
these changes are partially offset by an increase in actual returns on plan assets 
in  pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments 
adjusted operating income of our real estate and relocation services business increased million  from a loss of million in to income of million in the increase in adjusted operating income reflects higher relocation transaction volume and higher real estate average home sale prices  as well as lower operating expenses in compared to the prior year

to annual comparison 
the loss from corporate and other operations  on an adjusted operating income basis  increased million  from million in to million in the loss from corporate operations increased million  from million in to million in investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense  decreased million  primarily reflecting lower earnings from the investment of proceeds from our debt issuances  and other borrowings  which are invested in cash and short term investments  as well as lower yields on cash equivalents 
higher levels of short term liquidity have been maintained in to provide additional flexibility to address changing cash needs in view of volatile financial market conditions 
investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase  since december  of substantially all of our convertible senior notes  the proceeds of which had been invested primarily in short term investments  as well as lower earnings on other invested assets 
capital debt interest expense increased million due to a greater level of capital debt  which includes the issuance in june of billion of junior subordinated notes and reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes in previously  these proceeds were used to support an asset portfolio within the retirement segment for which the company has employed a substitute funding source  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
also contributing to the greater loss from corporate operations in are increased losses from other corporate activities  which reflects an increase in our deferred compensation liabilities and other retained corporate expenses 
the increased losses were partially offset by a decline in the level of costs related to our retained obligations to certain policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life sales practice remediation 
both our deferred compensation liabilities and our retained obligations to certain policyholders are impacted by financial market conditions

results of operations of closed block business we established the closed block business effective as of the date of demutualization 
the closed block business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies 
we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies 
see overview closed block business for additional details 
each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block  including investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains  mortality experience and other factors 
although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend 
table of contents obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million  which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies 
additionally  the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of  million at december   to be paid to closed block policyholders unless offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the closed block business 
consequently  results of the closed block business for all periods are presented only in accordance with us gaap

net investment income  net of interest expense  increased million  primarily due to an increase in income on joint ventures and limited partnership investments accounted for under the equity method  partially offset by lower portfolio yields 
in addition  dividends paid and accrued to policyholders decreased primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scale 
the impact of these items contributed to the actual cumulative earnings which  when compared to the expected cumulative earnings  resulted in an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of million  from compared to as noted above  as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million

these decreases to income were partially offset by a decrease of million in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders  primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scales for and in addition  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased million reflecting the impact of investment losses on actual gross margins for the period compared to the previously estimated expected gross margins for the period

table of contents investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments  are experience rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the investments supporting these experience rated products  excluding derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans  are classified as trading and are carried at fair value 
these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in asset management fees and other income 
interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in net investment income 
derivatives that support these experience rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as other long term investments carried at fair value and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience rated products are carried at unpaid principal  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses  and are reflected on the statements of financial position as commercial mortgage and other loans 
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on both trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and related derivatives 
this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis 
in addition  to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments  adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans supporting these experience rated contracts  which are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances 
the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience rated contracts  and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments  both realized and unrealized  that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders 
results for the years ended december   and include the recognition of net investment gains of million and  million  and net investment losses of  million  respectively  on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
these net investment gains and losses primarily represent interest rate related mark to market adjustments  which include the impact of changes in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities 
in addition  results for the years ended december   and include net investment gains of million  losses of million and gains of million  respectively  related to changes in the fair value of derivatives that support these experience rated products 
consistent with our treatment of realized investment gains losses  net  these gains and losses  which are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders  are excluded from adjusted operating income 
in addition  results for the years ended december   and include increases of million and million  and decreases of  million  respectively  in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments that support these experience rated contracts 
these liability changes are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances and are also excluded from adjusted operating income 
net investment gains net of the increase in contractholder liabilities due to these asset valuation changes resulted in net losses of million in  net gains of million in  and net losses of million in this primarily reflects timing differences between the recognition of the interest rate related mark to market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these mark to market adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
decreases to these contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of million as of december  and million as of december  we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
in addition  as prescribed by us gaap  changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held in our general account  other than when associated with impairments  are not recognized in income in the current period  while the impact of these changes in value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period

for additional information regarding the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value by hierarchy level see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value  which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions  can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as discussed in more detail below  the determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions  as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be 
table of contents significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner 
for a description of the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections provide additional information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our financial services businesses and our closed block business which are valued using level inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding separate account assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is primarily borne by our customers and policyholders 
fixed maturity and equity securities public fixed maturity securities included in level in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally developed valuations or non binding broker quotes 
despite the dislocated markets and low levels of liquidity in recent years  except for our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages as discussed below  the pricing we received from independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value for the remainder of our public fixed maturity portfolio 
as a result  for public fixed maturity securities we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing services under our normal pricing protocol 
securities with prices based on validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within level for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities  the discounted cash flow or other valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs  and accordingly  such securities are included in level in our fair value hierarchy 
as of december   our level fixed maturity securities included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages with a fair value of  million 
we reported fair values for these asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages as of december  based on our determination that the market for these securities for the period was an inactive market 
we considered both third party pricing information and an internally developed price based on a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair value of certain of these securities 
based on the unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow model and the limited observable market activity  asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages were included in level as of december  beginning in the second quarter of  we observed an increasingly active market  as evidence of orderly transactions in asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages became more apparent 
additionally  the valuation based on the pricing we received from independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value for these securities 
as a result  where third party pricing information based on the observable inputs was used to fair value the security  and based on the assessment that the market has been increasingly active  we have reported the fair values for these asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages in level since june  as of december   the fair values of these securities included in level were  million 
transfers out of level into level totaled  million for the year ended december  relating to this change 
excluding these asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  level fixed maturity securities included approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on non binding broker quotes  and approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of private fixed maturities  with values primarily based on internally developed models 
significant unobservable inputs used included issue specific credit adjustments  material non public financial information  management judgment  estimation of future earnings and cash flows  default rate assumptions  liquidity assumptions and non binding quotes from market makers 
these inputs are usually considered unobservable  as not all market participants will have access to this data 
for additional information regarding our holdings of asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  see  realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities asset backed securities 
while the fair value of these investments is in a significant unrealized loss position due to increased credit spreads and illiquidity in the financial markets  we believe the ultimate value in aggregate that will be realized from these investments is greater than that reflected by their current fair value 

table of contents the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of equity 
our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
other long term investments the fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process 
the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model  following an income approach that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue  operating expenses and discount rates 
the appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value 
these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually  and incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data  including any market transactions 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation  the real estate investments within other long term investments have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
consolidated real estate investment funds classified as level totaled approximately billion as of both december  and our direct investment in these funds is not material  and the majority of the assets recorded as a result of the consolidation of these funds are offset by a noncontrolling interest reflected as a separate component of equity 
the noncontrolling interest is not considered to be fair valued and therefore is not included in fair value reporting above 
the fair value of fund investments  where the fair value option has been elected  is primarily determined by the fund managers 
since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the company  these investments have also been included within level in our fair value hierarchy 
investments in these funds included in level totaled approximately billion as of december  derivative instruments derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets  within other trading account assets  or other long term investments  or as liabilities  within other liabilities  except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract 
the fair values of derivative contracts are determined based on quoted prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models  and are affected by changes in market factors including non performance risk 
the majority of our derivative positions are traded in the over the counter  or otc  derivative market and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy since they have bid and ask prices that are actively quoted or can be readily obtained from external market data providers 
our policy is to use mid market pricing consistent with our best estimate of fair value 
the bid ask spreads for otc derivatives classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are generally wider than derivatives classified within level thus requiring more judgment in estimating the mid market price of such derivatives 
derivatives classified as level include first to default credit basket swaps  look back equity options and other structured products 
these derivatives are valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets 
otc derivatives classified within level are validated through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker dealer values 
the fair values of otc derivative assets and liabilities classified as level totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  and million and million  respectively  as of december   without giving consideration to the impact of netting 
for additional information regarding embedded derivatives in our annuity and retirement products classified as level  see variable annuity optional living benefit features below 
all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of dealer and non dealer related derivatives  with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations  are recorded in current earnings 
generally  the changes in fair value of non dealer related derivatives  excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
for additional information regarding the impact of changes in fair value of derivative instruments on our results of operations see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses below 

table of contents variable annuity optional living benefit features our liability for future policy benefits includes general account liabilities for guarantees on variable annuity contracts  including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits gmiwb 
while these guarantees primarily relate to the optional living benefit features of our individual annuities segment  they are also included in certain variable annuities in our international insurance segment and certain retirement account based group variable annuities in our retirement segment 
these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in realized investment gains losses  net 
the fair values of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
this methodology could result in either a liability or contra liability balance  given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions 
since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations  the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques 
because there are significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features that are primarily unobservable  the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
we are also required to incorporate the market perceived risk of our own non performance in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features 
since insurance liabilities are senior to debt  we believe that reflecting the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries in the valuation of the liability appropriately takes into consideration our own risk of non performance 
to reflect the market s perception of our own risk of non performance  we incorporate an additional spread over libor into the discount rate used in the valuations of the embedded derivative liabilities 
the additional spread over libor rates incorporated into the discount rate as of december  generally ranged from to basis points for the portion of the interest rate curve most relevant to these liabilities 
this additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to those embedded derivatives in a liability position and not to those in a contra liability position 
as of december   the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the optional living benefit features of the individual annuities segment  before the adjustment for the market s perception of our own non performance risk  was a net million liability 
this liability was comprised of  million of embedded derivative liabilities net of million of contra liabilities 
for  our adjustment for the market s perception of our own non performance risk resulted in a million decrease to the embedded derivative liability for the individual annuities segment  reflecting the additional spread over libor we incorporated into the discount rate used in the valuations of those embedded derivatives in a liability position 
for december   our adjustment for the market s perception of our non performance risk resulted in a million decrease to the embedded derivative liability for the individual annuities segment 
the increase in the adjustment for the market s perception of our non performance risk from december  to december   was driven by an increase in the value of the underlying embedded derivative liabilities primarily due to lower interest rates 
the change in fair value of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb resulted in a decrease in the total liability of million  from a liability of million as of december  to a contra liability of million as of december  the decrease primarily reflects lower expected future benefit payments  primarily resulting from an increase in policyholder account balances driven by favorable market conditions in these changes were significantly offset by decreased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and changes in value of related hedging instruments  primarily in our individual annuities segment as described in more detail under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the sale of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments  as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments

for a further discussion of our policy regarding commercial mortgage and other loans  see general account investments commercial mortgage and other loans commercial mortgage and other loan quality below 
the level of other than temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is generally expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
historically  the causes of other than temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region 
as discussed in more detail below  certain of the other than temporary impairments recognized for the year ended december  are primarily related to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and japanese commercial mortgage backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  foreign currency translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity  and the intent to sell securities  primarily related to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
other than temporary impairments for the years ended december  and  were primarily related to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and reflected the overall deterioration of the us housing market 
we may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
in light of unprecedented market conditions  and in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy of certain portfolios 
in the second quarter of  we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios 
other than temporary impairments  interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors are excluded from adjusted operating income 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
we also use equity based and interest rate derivatives to hedge the risks embedded in some of our annuity products 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains losses  net  subject to certain exceptions realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments and related charges and adjustments

fixed maturity other than temporary impairments in were concentrated in asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  japanese commercial mortgage backed securities  and the services  manufacturing  and finance sectors of our corporate securities 
these other than temporary impairments were primarily driven by asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  the impact of the rising forward libor curve and the intent to sell securities

general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our brokerage  trading and banking operations  real estate and relocation services  assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints over time  and for certain portfolios  maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of their major products 
our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the financial services businesses over time include the investment of proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  and operating cash flows  into investments with competitive yields  and where appropriate  the sale of the portfolio s lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s duration  credit  currency and other risk constraints  all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 

table of contents in light of the recent market and economic conditions  while we continue to look to maximize book yield and match the liability characteristics of our major products  our portfolio management approach now reflects a greater consideration of the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity  as well as our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery  and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery 
in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy previously employed in the closed block business and certain portfolios of the financial services businesses 
starting in the second quarter of  we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios  and continue to evaluate trading strategies for these portfolios

management of investments we design asset mix strategies and derivative strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management  strategic and tactical asset allocations and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework 
derivative strategies are employed within our risk management framework to help manage duration gaps  currency  and other risks between assets and liabilities 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments  and other than trading activities insurance and annuity products asset liability management 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those managed by our international insurance segment  under the direction and oversight of the asset liability management and risk management groups 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally  within enterprise risk constraints  in most cases using the international and domestic asset management capabilities of our international investments or asset management segments 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions periodically 
our asset liability management and risk management groups develop the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries  oversee the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the asset liability management and risk management groups work closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes and to develop investment objectives  including performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics and funding agreements 

table of contents we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment

asset backed securities included within asset backed securities attributable to the financial services businesses are securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
while there is no market standard definition  we define sub prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores  as well as mortgages with higher loan to value ratios  or limited documentation 
the significant deterioration of the us housing market  high interest rate resets  higher unemployment levels  and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub prime mortgages have led to higher delinquency rates  particularly for those mortgages issued in and recently there has been significant attention given to potential deficiencies in lenders foreclosure documentation  causing delays in the foreclosure process 
many lenders have indicated that the issues are administrative and they do not expect significant delays in their foreclosure proceedings 
from the perspective of an investor in securities backed by sub prime collateral  any significant delays in foreclosure proceedings could result in increased servicing costs which could negatively impact the value of the impacted securities 
separately  as an investor in sub prime securities  we are evaluating our legal options with respect to potential remedies arising from any potential deficiencies related to the original lending and securitization practices

table of contents commercial mortgage backed securities weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  along with an overall decrease in liquidity and availability of capital have led to a very difficult refinancing environment and an increase in the overall delinquency rate on commercial mortgages in the commercial mortgage backed securities market 
despite an otherwise stabilizing economy  job growth  a key factor in driving demand for commercial real estate  remains weak 
however  the pace of deterioration has slowed and prices of commercial real estate appear to have bottomed 
there were signs of improvement in commercial real estate fundamentals in such as vacancy rates declining from their peak and positive rent growth

table of contents the super senior structure was introduced to the us commercial mortgage backed securities market in late and was modified in early to increase subordination from to 
with the changes to the commercial mortgage backed securities structure in  there became three distinct aaa classes for commercial mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms  super senior aaa with subordination  mezzanine aaa with subordination and junior aaa with approximately subordination 
the super senior class has priority over the mezzanine and junior classes to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments and recoveries on defaulted loans 
as a result  all super senior bonds must be completely repaid before the mezzanine or junior bonds receive any principal cash flows 
in addition  the super senior bonds will not experience any loss of principal until both the entire mezzanine and junior bonds are written down to zero 
we believe the importance of this additional credit enhancement afforded to the super senior class over the mezzanine and junior classes is limited in a benign commercial real estate cycle with low defaults but becomes more significant in a deep commercial real estate downturn under which expected losses increase substantially 
in addition to enhanced subordination  certain securities within the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows 
the super senior class is generally structured such that shorter duration time tranches have priority over longer duration time tranches as to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments  and recoveries on defaulted loans until the deal reaches cumulative net loss  at which point all super senior securities are paid pro rata 
as a result  short of reaching cumulative net losses  the shorter duration super senior tranches must be completely repaid before the longest duration super senior tranche receives any principal cash flows 
we have generally focused our purchases of recent vintage commercial mortgage backed securities on shorter duration super senior tranches that we believe have sufficient priority to ensure that in most scenarios our positions will be fully repaid prior to the structure reaching the cumulative net loss threshold

naic designations of through generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade  which include securities rated ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by standard poor s 
however  in the fourth quarter of the naic adopted rules which changed the methodology for determining the naic designations for non agency residential mortgage backed securities  including our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
under the new rules  rather than being based on the rating of a third party rating agency  as of december  the naic designations for such securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party engaged by the naic and the statutory carrying value of the security  including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized

we have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the tables above as other than temporary impairments in earnings based on our detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows on each of these securities 
the gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to general credit spread widening in the structured credit marketplace  liquidity discounts  and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we believe the recoverable value of these investments based on the expected future cash flows is greater than or equal to our remaining amortized cost

we have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the tables above as other than temporary impairments in earnings based on our detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows on each of these securities 
the gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to general credit spread widening in the structured credit marketplace and liquidity discounts  and we believe the recoverable value of these investments based on the expected future cash flows is greater than or equal to our remaining amortized cost

table of contents required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis 
see other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
for private placements  our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer  and the extent and duration of the decline 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we place greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value 
our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment 
we continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases 
in addition  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when a we have the intent to sell the debt security or b it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or c a foreign currency denominated security with a foreign currency translation loss approaches maturity 
for all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet any of these criteria  we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security 
if the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment  an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
the determination of the assumptions used in these projections requires the use of significant management judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other than temporary impairments for debt securities

we originate commercial and agricultural mortgage loans using a dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices 
all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending 
uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance 
residential property loans primarily include japanese recourse loans 
upon default of these recourse loans we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner  in addition to the mortgaged property 
in addition  these loans are backed by third party guarantors 
other collateralized loans attributable to the financial services businesses include million and million of collateralized consumer loans and million and million of loans collateralized by aviation assets as of december  and  respectively 
composition of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans the flow of capital to commercial real estate has improved dramatically during as the adverse market and economic conditions that began in the second half of have improved 
portfolio lenders are actively originating loans on the highest quality properties in primary markets  resulting in an increase in the liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market 
in addition  the commercial banks are selectively more active and there has been an emergence of new loan origination activity by a handful of securitization lenders 
these conditions have led to greater competition for portfolio lenders such as our general account  resulting in a tightening on loan pricing  though underwriting remains conservative 
while there is still weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans remain low and 
table of contents relatively stable 
for certain property types  the market fundamentals are beginning to stabilize  though other property types will lag in terms of rising vacancies or falling rents

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a smaller loan to value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service 
table of contents coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments 
a larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments 
as of december   our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times  and a weighted average loan to value ratio of 
as of december   approximately of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses were fixed rate loans

for those general account commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses that were originated in  the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was times and the weighted average loan to value ratio was 
the values utilized in calculating these loan to value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio  which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value 
our periodic review also includes a quality re rating process  whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above 
as discussed below  the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for loan losses 
for loans with collateral under construction  renovation or lease up  a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan to value and debt service coverage ratios 
our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the financial services businesses included approximately billion of such loans as of december  and billion of such loans as of december   and our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the closed block business included approximately billion and billion of such loans as of december  and  respectively 
all else being equal  these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized

table of contents commercial mortgage and other loan quality ongoing review of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a pre defined set of criteria  where they are assigned to one of the following categories 
we place loans on early warning status in cases where  based on our analysis of the loan s collateral  the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors  we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur 
we classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
as described below  in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans 
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process 
the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be non performing as a result of our loan review process  and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list 
we define a non performing loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for a non performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above  as well as property type diversification  our past loan experience and other relevant factors 
together with historical credit migration and default statistics  the internal quality ratings are used to determine a default probability by loan 
historical loss severity statistics by property type are then applied to arrive at an estimate for incurred but not specifically identified losses 
historical credit migration  default and loss severity statistics are updated each quarter based on our actual loan experience  and are considered together with other relevant qualitative factors in making the final portfolio reserve calculations 
the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors

other than temporary impairments of equity securities for those equity securities classified as available for sale we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value 
all securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value maintained for one year or greater  and declines in value greater than  the reasons for the decline in value issuer specific event  currency or market fluctuation  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
we generally recognize other than temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater 
in 
table of contents addition  in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including an assessment of the issuer s capital position  and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary  we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
once identified  these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
for perpetual preferred securities  which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities  we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities  factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and the lack of a formal maturity date

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company 
capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses  fund business growth  and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances 
our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses  general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein 
management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi year time horizon through our quarterly planning process 
we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds presently available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries  including reasonably foreseeable contingencies 

table of contents we continue to refine our metrics for capital management 
these refinements to the current framework  which is primarily based on statutory risk based capital measures  are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company 
in addition  we continue to use an economic capital framework for making certain business decisions 
similar to our planning and management process for liquidity  we also use a disciplined framework to ensure the availability of adequate capital under reasonably foreseeable contingencies 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  signed into law on july   could result in the imposition of new capital  liquidity and other requirements on prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
see business regulation for information regarding the potential impact of the dodd frank act on the company 
acquisition of aig star life insurance co  ltd  aig edison life insurance company and related entities on february   we completed the acquisition from american international group  inc  or aig  of aig star life insurance co  ltd  aig edison life insurance company and certain other aig subsidiaries pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated september  with aig

table of contents the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension postretirement benefits  outstanding junior subordinated debt and outstanding capital debt of the financial services businesses 
capital debt consists of borrowings that are used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of prudential financial  as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of prudential financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements 
as shown in the table below  as of december   the financial services businesses had billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessments of these businesses and operations  we believe this level of capital was consistent with the aa ratings targets of our regulated operating entities as of december  december  in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension postretirement benefits junior subordinated debt ie hybrid securities capital debt total capital we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets  and we believe prudential financial s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with those ratings targets 
management uses the ratio of capital debt to total capital as such amounts are reflected in the table above as a primary measure of the use of financial leverage 
as of december   our capital debt to total capital ratio was 
the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt have certain features which result in their treatment as hybrid securities by the rating agencies 
as a result  for purposes of calculating the capital debt to total capital ratio  of our outstanding junior subordinated debt is treated as equity and the remaining is treated as capital debt  based on moody s current criteria for these types of hybrid securities  which is the most restrictive treatment among the rating agencies 
our long term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are a for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  and a for am best company  or am best 
our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best

restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends as described below  all dividends or other distributions paid by prudential insurance may be paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets as of the prior calendar year end 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was billion and billion  respectively  and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of  million and million  respectively 
prudential insurance must give prior notification to the new jersey department of banking and insurance  or njdobi  or the department  of its intent to pay any dividend or distribution 
also  if any dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus or ii the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses  the dividend is considered to be an extraordinary dividend and the prior approval of the department is required for payment of the dividend 
prudential insurance s statutory surplus as of december  was billion and its statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  for the year ended december  was billion 
in addition to the regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt 
table of contents contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
on may   prudential insurance paid an ordinary dividend of billion  and on november   it paid an extraordinary dividend of million 
also in  prudential annuities life assurance corporation paid an ordinary dividend of million and an extraordinary dividend of million 
these dividends were ultimately received by prudential financial 
as a result of gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain other restrictions that preclude gibraltar life from paying dividends to prudential financial in the near term 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar life to pay dividends 
in  the prudential life insurance company  ltd  or prudential of japan  for which the payment of dividends is subject to regulatory limitations pursuant to statutory accounting principles  paid a dividend of billion  or approximately million  to prudential holdings of japan  inc  some of which was used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the star and edison businesses 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint 
the ability of each of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in depends on market conditions and other factors 
see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries below for additional details on the liquidity of our domestic insurance subsidiaries  international insurance subsidiaries and asset management subsidiaries 
alternative sources of liquidity prudential financial maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis 
depending on the overall availability of cash  the parent holding company invests excess cash on a short term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets 
additional longer term liquidity is available through inter affiliate borrowing arrangements 
prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities  as discussed under credit facilities  as well as the alternative sources of liquidity described below 
commercial paper programs prudential financial has a commercial paper program  the authorized capacity of which was reduced from billion to billion as of june  prudential financial commercial paper borrowings generally have been used to fund the working capital needs of prudential financial s subsidiaries and to provide short term liquidity at prudential financial 
as of december   prudential financial s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were million  representing an increase of million from december  as of december   the weighted average maturity of prudential financial s outstanding commercial paper was days  of which was overnight 
the daily average commercial paper outstanding during under this program was million

the daily average commercial paper outstanding during under this program was million 
the weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents prudential funding maintains a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth at all times 
prudential financial has also issued a subordinated guarantee covering prudential funding s commercial paper program 
while we continue to consider commercial paper one of our alternative sources of liquidity due to the low cost and efficient financing it provides  we have significantly reduced our reliance on commercial paper to fund our operations  and have developed plans that would enable us to further reduce  or if necessary eliminate  our commercial paper borrowings by accessing other sources of liquidity 
as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
these facilities can be used as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs or for other general corporate purposes 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
for a further discussion of these lines of credit  see credit facilities 
asset based financing we conduct asset based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries  including transactions such as securities lending  repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls  in order to earn spread income  to borrow funds  or to facilitate trading activity 
these programs are driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace 
the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short term spread portfolios of our domestic insurance entities 
investments held in the short term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and fixed maturities  including mortgage and asset backed securities  with a weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less 
a portion of the asset backed securities held in our short term spread portfolios  including our enhanced short term portfolio  are collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short term spread portfolio 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities for a further discussion of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime holdings  including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short term portfolio 
these short term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements  which among other things  do not allow for significant asset liability interest rate duration mismatch 
as of december   our financial services businesses had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase  billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities and million representing securities sold but not yet purchased 
of the billion for the financial services businesses as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from two days to three months with a weighted average maturity of days 
the daily weighted average outstanding under such programs during was billion 
as of december   our financial services businesses had liabilities totaling billion under such programs 
in addition  as of december   our financial services businesses had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls under which we are committed to repurchase million of mortgage backed securities  or to be announced tba forward contracts 
these repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives 
these mortgage backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
as of december   our closed block business had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million representing cash collateral for loaned securities 
of the billion for the closed block business as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from two days to three months with a weighted average maturity of days 
the daily weighted average outstanding under such programs during was billion 
as of december   our closed block business had liabilities totaling billion under such programs 
in addition  as of december   the closed block business had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls under which we are committed to repurchase million of tba forward 
table of contents contracts 
these repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives 
these mortgage backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
as of december   our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the lending program of billion  of which billion were on loan 
taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december   we believe approximately billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable  of which approximately billion relates to the financial services businesses  however  these amounts are subject to potential regulatory constraints 
further  changes in market conditions can affect the ability to lend the available assets 
as referenced above  these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates 
as such  we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs 
holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available financing 
current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds  investment spreads  asset liability duration matching and liquidity 
federal home loan bank of new york prudential insurance is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny 
membership allows prudential insurance access to the fhlbny s financial services  including the ability to obtain collateralized loans and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity 
fhlbny borrowings and funding agreements are collateralized by qualifying mortgage related assets or us treasury securities  the fair value of which must be maintained at certain specified levels relative to outstanding borrowings  depending on the type of asset pledged 
fhlbny membership requires prudential insurance to own member stock and borrowings require the purchase of activity based stock in an amount equal to of outstanding borrowings 
under fhlbny guidelines  if prudential insurance s financial strength ratings decline below a a a stable by s p moody s fitch  respectively  and the fhlbny does not receive written assurances from njdobi regarding prudential insurance s solvency  new borrowings from the fhlbny would be limited to a term of days or less 
currently there are no restrictions on the term of borrowings from the fhlbny 
njdobi previously permitted prudential insurance to pledge collateral to the fhlbny in an amount of up to of its prior year end statutory net admitted assets  excluding separate account assets  however  since we elected not to seek an extension  this limitation reset to effective january  based on prudential insurance s statutory net admitted assets as of december   the limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity after taking into account required collateralization levels and purchases of activity based stock of approximately billion 
nevertheless  fhlbny borrowings are subject to the fhlbny s discretion and to the availability of qualifying assets at prudential insurance 
as of december   we had pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of billion  which supported outstanding collateralized advances of billion and collateralized funding agreements of billion 
the fair value of qualifying assets that were available to prudential insurance but not pledged amounted to billion as of december  as of december   million of the fhlbny outstanding advances is reflected in short term debt and matures in december and the remaining million is in long term debt and matures in december fhlbny advances declined billion from december   reflecting the repayment at maturity of billion of advances in june and the refinancing of billion of advances in december 
the june repayment at maturity was funded through the repayment of an affiliate loan which was replaced by a loan from prudential financial and with available cash 
as of december   million of the outstanding fhlbny proceeds were used to support the operating needs of our businesses  and million were used to purchase investments  including the fhlbny activity based stock 
the funding agreements issued to the fhlbny  which are reflected in policyholders account balances  have priority claim status above debt 
table of contents holders of prudential insurance 
these funding agreements currently serve as a substitute funding source for a product of our retirement segment  which earns investment spread that was previously funded by retail medium term notes issued by prudential financial 
federal home loan bank of boston prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  or priac  became a member of the federal home loan bank of boston  or fhlbb  in december membership allows priac access to collateralized advances which will be classified in short term debt or long term debt  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
priac s membership in fhlbb requires the ownership of member stock and borrowings from fhlbb require the purchase of activity based stock in an amount between and of outstanding borrowings  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
as of december   priac had no advances outstanding under the fhlbb facility 
the connecticut department of insurance  or ctdoi  permits priac to pledge up to billion in qualifying assets to secure fhlbb borrowings through december  priac must seek re approval from ctdoi prior to borrowing additional funds after that date 
based on available eligible assets as of december   priac had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity  after taking into consideration required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity based fhlbb stock  of approximately billion 
liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
the impact of prudential funding s financing capacity on liquidity  as discussed more fully under alternative sources of liquidity  is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support 
the results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments 
pursuant to the documentation for the disposition of our property and casualty operations completed in  we were required to deposit cash or securities into a trust for the purpose of securing insurance liabilities that were to have been transferred to prudential insurance following completion of the disposition but that have not been so transferred 
in june  we deposited securities which  as of december   have a market value of million 
the deposit of these assets was not a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations  as well as internal and external borrowings 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 

table of contents we believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels  policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  and the relative safety of competing products  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
in addition  market volatility can impact the level of capital required to support our businesses  particularly in our annuity business 
our domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  commitments to invest and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates  due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of market declines in recent years 
annuity benefits and guaranteed investment withdrawals under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities 
as of december  and  our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of billion and billion  respectively  which includes a portion financed with asset based financing 
the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity 
table of contents under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements  including under foreseeable stress scenarios 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized investment gains and losses  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
instead of selling investments at depressed market prices externally  in order to preserve economic value including tax attributes  we may also sell investments from one subsidiary to another at fair market value or transfer investments internally between businesses within the same subsidiary 
capital the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries rbc ratios to a level consistent with their ratings targets 
rbc is determined by statutory guidelines and formulas that consider  among other things  risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capitalization 
as of december   rbc for prudential insurance was approximately  which exceeded the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations 
in addition  all of our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries have rbc ratios that exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations 
the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing  advertising or promotional activities 
the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations  changes in the values of derivatives  the level of impairments recorded and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio  among other items 
further  the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by  or credit quality migration affecting  the reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels 
the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries is also affected by statutory accounting rules  which are subject to change by insurance regulators 
during  we changed the focus of our capital hedge program from the equity price risk associated with our annuities business to a broader view of equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the company as a whole 
in the second quarter of  we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the individual annuities segment as described under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities and entered into equity index linked derivative transactions that are designed to mitigate the impact on statutory capital of a severe equity market stress event 
the program now focuses on tail risk rather than general equity market declines in order to protect our capital in a more cost effective manner under stress scenarios 
we assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis  and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the company s risk position or other factors 

table of contents in addition to hedging the equity market exposure as mentioned above  we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs  as described under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
in our living benefits hedging program  we purchase equity options and futures as well as interest rate derivatives to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in equity markets  interest rates  and market volatility 
historically  our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  with capital market derivatives and options 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy as  in the low interest rate environment  we do not believe the gaap value of the embedded derivative liability to be an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target 
our new hedge target continues to be grounded in a gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the risk free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds  which support these living benefits  are invested in assets that contain risk 
consistent with sound risk management practices we evaluate hedge levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition 
as part of our capital planning and management process  we use a disciplined framework to ensure the availability of adequate capital under reasonably foreseeable contingencies  including potentially adverse outcomes resulting from our hedging strategy 
we reinsure variable annuity living benefit guarantees to our offshore captive reinsurance company 
we satisfy the reinsurance reserve credit requirements by funding statutory reserve credit trusts 
reinsurance credit reserve requirements can move materially in either direction due to changes in equity markets and interest rates  actuarial assumptions and other factors 
higher reinsurance credit reserve requirements would necessitate depositing additional assets in the statutory reserve credit trusts  while lower reinsurance credit reserve requirements would allow assets to be removed from the statutory reserve credit trusts 
we provided additional funding to the captive reinsurance trusts of million for the second quarter of to meet increased reserve credit requirements due to unfavorable equity market conditions and lower interest rates  and provided an additional million for the third quarter of due to an update of actuarial assumptions based on an annual review  most notably a decrease in expected future lapse rates  partially offset by favorable equity market conditions 
due to favorable equity market conditions and higher interest rates in the fourth quarter of  our need to fund the captive reinsurance trusts has declined by  million 
we review the reinsurance reserve credit requirements and the value of the reinsurance trust assets on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that the value of the reinsurance trust assets are not sufficient to meet the reinsurance reserve credit requirements  we would expect to satisfy those additional needs through a combination of funding the reinsurance credit trusts with available cash  loans from prudential financial and or affiliates and assets pledged to our offshore captive reinsurance company under hedging positions related to our living benefit features 
we also continue to evaluate other options to address reserve credit needs such as obtaining letters of credit 
international insurance and investments subsidiaries in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through operating cash flows from ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity  and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries 
we monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures  taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 
as with our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
as of december  and  our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of billion and billion  respectively 
of those amounts  billion and billion  respectively  were associated with gibraltar life 

table of contents a special dividend was payable to certain gibraltar life policyholders based on of the net increase in the fair value  through march  of certain real estate and loans  net of transaction costs and taxes  included in the gibraltar life reorganization plan 
the first special dividend was paid in and the final special dividend was payable generally on the next anniversary of the issue date of each applicable insurance policy  beginning in april in  gibraltar life made distributions to policyholders of million in payment of the special dividend liability  primarily in the form of additional policy values  and to a lesser extent in cash 
the liability related to the special dividend was fully paid as of june  on february   we completed our acquisition of the star and edison businesses 
gibraltar life and prudential of japan each contributed million to the payment of the acquisition purchase price  with the remaining funding provided by prudential financial and other subsidiaries 
although these contributions will reduce local solvency margin ratios in gibraltar life and prudential of japan  the solvency margins for these companies remain in excess of our targets 
see below for additional information regarding solvency margin requirements 
the contributions did not materially impact gibraltar life s or prudential of japan s liquidity as their investment portfolios were positioned to provide the funding 
star and edison solvency margin ratios at acquisition are estimated to be in excess of our solvency margin targets and will continue to be managed to capitalization levels consistent with our aa ratings targets 
we believe the liquidity profiles of star and edison are sufficient to meet their obligations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
on may   our gibraltar life operations acquired yamato life  a japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in october gibraltar life served as the reorganization sponsor for yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired yamato by contributing million of capital to yamato 
concurrent with our acquisition  substantially all of yamato s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges were in the first year and decline by each year thereafter 
subsequent to the acquisition  we renamed the acquired company the prudential gibraltar financial life insurance company  ltd 
as of december  and  prudential of japan had billion and billion  respectively  of general account insurance related liabilities  other than dividends to policyholders 
prudential of japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  and additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
as of december  and  our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of billion and billion  respectively  as well as fixed maturity investments  other than those designated as held to maturity  with fair values of billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating  of which billion and billion were associated with gibraltar life and prudential of japan  respectively 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating  of which billion and billion were associated with gibraltar life and prudential of japan  respectively 
in addition  of the billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity and considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating  billion  or  were invested in government or government agency bonds 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations liquidity under stress scenarios 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by us insurance regulators  regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies 
all of our international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in 
table of contents excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities 
these solvency margins are also a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations 
we manage these solvency margins to a capitalization level consistent with our aa ratings target 
maintenance of our solvency ratios at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning  as in certain jurisdictions  such as japan  these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength 
the financial services agency  the insurance regulator in japan  has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company s core capital is calculated 
these changes are effective for the fiscal year ending march   however  it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose prior to that date both the old and new solvency margin calculations 
while we believe that the solvency margins of our japanese insurance subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements and our internal targets  it is possible that a reduction in our reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect customer perception of our financial strength 
the capital requirements in korea and taiwan are also undergoing change 
we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements  including the strategies discussed in results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance and investments division 
these hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs 
the internal hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities and serve to hedge the value of us dollar denominated investments held on the books of these yen based entities 
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and these yen based subsidiaries 
the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial funded million of cash settlements related to the internal hedge program  which were paid to the yen based subsidiaries 
as of december   the market value of the internal hedges was a liability of  million owed to the yen based subsidiaries of prudential financial 
absent any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of december   the  million internal hedge liability represents the present value of the net cash flows from prudential financial to these entities over the life of the hedging instruments  up to years 
a significant yen appreciation over an extended period of time  and in excess of the forward exchange rates  would result in higher net cash outflows from prudential financial in excess of our historical experience 
our external hedges primarily serve to hedge the equity investments in certain subsidiaries and future income of most foreign subsidiaries 
the external hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and external parties 
cash settlements on these activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and the external parties and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial paid million of net cash flows for international insurance related external hedge settlements 
as of december   the net liability related to external foreign currency hedges was million 
a significant appreciation in yen and other foreign currencies could result in net cash outflows in excess of our liability 
during the second quarter of  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of our korean operations due to a variety of considerations  including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from a strengthening korean won 
for similar reasons  during the third quarter of  we also terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure for all other foreign operations  excluding our japan and taiwan insurance operations 
in our international investments operations  liquidity is provided through asset management fees as well as commission revenue 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distributions of dividends and returns of capital 
as with our domestic operations  the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe cash flows from our international investments subsidiaries are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 

table of contents asset management subsidiaries our asset management businesses  which include real estate  public and private fixed income and public equity asset management  as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing  and retail investment products  such as mutual funds and other retail services  are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions 
our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make  and the fee based asset management business can provide a relatively stable source of cash flow to prudential financial 
the principal sources of liquidity for our fee based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
the principal sources of liquidity for our proprietary investments and interim loans held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments  the ability to liquidate investments  and available borrowing lines from internal sources  including prudential funding and prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner  declines in the value of assets and credit defaults 
the global economic recession experienced during and increased the liquidity risks associated with our proprietary investments and interim loans  as the markets for certain investments  such as commercial mortgages and real estate  became less liquid 
though these markets have improved  if we needed to sell these investments  it could still take longer and the prices could be lower than prior to the global recession 
in december  we received approval from njdobi for prudential insurance to provide an month billion lending facility to our commercial mortgage operation that is collateralized primarily by its interim loan portfolio 
the maximum amount outstanding under this facility was billion and was drawn at inception 
this amount was gradually repaid during the period it was outstanding and was repaid in its entirety during the second quarter of using long term funding provided by prudential financial 
in april  our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business received approval to participate in a fannie mae alternative delivery program known as asap plus as soon as pooled delivery 
our approval limit for outstanding balances on asap plus is presently million 
this program allows us to assign a qualified fannie mae loan trade commitment to fannie mae as early as the next business day after a loan closes  and receive of the loan purchase price from fannie mae 
the program does not eliminate the need to provide temporary warehouse financing  but does significantly reduce the duration of funding requirements for eligible fannie mae originated loans from the normal delivery cycle of two to four weeks down to as little as one to two days 
there was no balance outstanding on this program as of december  certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by prudential insurance 
in the normal course of business  these separate accounts enter into purchase commitments which include commitments to purchase real estate  invest in future real estate partnerships  and or fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously acquired real estate investments 
certain purchases of real estate are contingent on the developer s development of the real estate according to plans and specifications outlined in a pre sale agreement or the property achieving a certain level of leasing 
purchase commitments are typically entered into by prudential insurance on behalf of the particular separate account and  upon acquisition  are titled either in the name of prudential insurance or an llc subsidiary formed for that purpose 
in certain cases  the commitments specify that recourse on the obligation is limited to the assets of the separate account 
at december  and  total outstanding purchase commitments were billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease in total outstanding purchase commitments was primarily driven by debt repayments funded from investor capital contributions and property sales 
the following is a summary of the 
table of contents outstanding purchase commitments for these separate account portfolios as of december  off balance sheet commitments have not yet substantially satisfied pre conditions and are considered contingent liabilities 
on balance sheet commitments represent obligations which have substantially satisfied pre conditions of the commitments 
contractual maturity date after total in millions off balance sheet commitments recourse to prudential insurance recourse limited to assets of separate accounts total off balance sheet commitments on balance sheet commitments recourse to prudential insurance recourse limited to assets of separate accounts total on balance sheet commitments total commitments the contractual maturity dates of some of the outstanding purchase commitments may accelerate upon a failure to maintain required loan to value ratios  failure of prudential insurance to maintain required ratings or failure to satisfy other financial covenants 
some separate accounts have also entered into syndicated credit facilities providing for borrowings in the aggregate amount of up to billion 
as of december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under these credit facilities 
these facilities also include loan to value ratio requirements and other financial covenants 
recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account 
as of december   these separate account portfolios had combined gross and net asset values of billion and billion  respectively 
at the time of maturity of a commitment obligation  prudential insurance often endeavors to negotiate extensions  refinancings or other solutions with creditors 
management believes that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to ultimately meet their obligations 
however  there is a risk that the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales  operating cash flow  deposits from clients  debt refinancings or from the above mentioned portfolio level credit facilities 
in cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations  prudential insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions 
to date  prudential insurance has not been required to provide any such funding 
as of december  and  our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
financing activities prudential financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that permits the issuance of public debt  equity and hybrid securities 
as a well known seasoned issuer under sec rules  prudential financial s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing  pay as you go fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective amendments 
also  in accordance with these rules  the shelf registration statement has no stated issuance capacity 
in november  prudential financial issued  shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of per share for gross proceeds of billion 
the proceeds from the offering  along with proceeds from the sale of billion of medium term notes  were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the star and edison businesses from aig

table of contents prudential financial also maintains a retail medium term notes program  including the internotes program  under its shelf registration statement with an authorized issuance capacity of billion 
as of december   approximately billion remained available under this program 
the retail medium term notes program traditionally has served as a funding source for a product of our retirement segment for which we earn investment spread  however  the program can also be used for general corporate purposes 
beginning in  we began using a portion of the proceeds from outstanding retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes and used funding agreements issued to the fhlbny as a substitute funding source for the asset portfolio within the retirement segment  as discussed in prudential financial alternative sources of liquidity federal home loan bank of new york 
the weighted average interest rates on prudential financial s retail medium term notes were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
a decline in demand by retail investors  and an increase in borrowing costs versus historical levels have resulted in a halt in new issuances under the retail medium term notes program 
however  if the capital markets continue to improve  we may resume new issuances under the program 
in  prudential financial issued million of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors and million of fixed rate junior subordinated notes to retail investors 
both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities  which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies 
both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of june  and a final maturity of june  in connection with the issuance of both series of notes  prudential financial entered into a replacement capital covenant  or rcc  for the benefit of holders of its senior notes due under the rcc  prudential financial agreed that it will not repay  redeem  defease  or purchase the notes prior to june   unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities  which include  but are not limited to  hybrid capital securities and common stock

any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity position  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the states of domicile of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries have in place a regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  and a supporting guideline entitled the application of the valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as guideline axxx 
the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees 
many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive  and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of regulation xxx and guideline axxx on our term and universal life insurance business  including actions that are described in more detail below 
in  a subsidiary of prudential insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to billion of ten year floating rate surplus notes through  if certain conditions are met commonly referred to as xxx notes  for the purpose 
table of contents of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies 
in connection with this financing arrangement  prudential financial has agreed with such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a prescribed minimum level 
concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note  prudential financial enters into arrangements with the buyer  which are accounted for as derivative instruments  which may result in payments by  or to  prudential financial over the term of the surplus notes  to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes 
principal factors that impact the value of the surplus notes are mortality experience  interest rates and credit spreads 
as of december   there have been no collateral postings made under the derivative instruments 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
total outstanding notes under this facility were billion as of both december  and during  a subsidiary of prudential insurance issued million of year floating rate surplus notes commonly referred to as axxx notes to an unaffiliated financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
in connection with this financing arrangement  prudential financial has agreed with such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a prescribed minimum level 
concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes  prudential financial entered into a credit derivative that requires prudential financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus note 
under this credit derivative  we are required to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of year credit default swap spreads on prudential financial s senior debt 
as of december   no collateral amounts were required to be paid 
as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  we expect to have additional borrowing needs to finance statutory reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
we were able to fund these reserves through primarily with the proceeds from prudential financial s june medium term note issuance 
based on current sales expectations  we believe our reserve growth could be up to million 
we are evaluating both internal and external solutions to fund this growth 
funding agreement notes issuance program in  prudential insurance established a funding agreement notes issuance program pursuant to which a delaware statutory trust issues medium term notes which are included in our statements of financial position in policyholders account balances and not included in the foregoing table secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by prudential insurance and included in our retirement segment 
the funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium term notes 
the medium term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the securities act of the notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from five to ten years 
as of december  and  the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled billion and billion  respectively  out of a total authorized amount of up to billion 
the decrease in outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes is due to maturities in excess of issuances during our ability to issue under this program depends on market conditions 
the aggregate maturities of these notes over the next months are approximately million 
we intend to repay the maturing notes through a combination of cash flows from asset maturities  asset sales  new liability origination and internal sources of funds 
credit facilities as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding maintained an aggregate of billion of unsecured committed credit facilities 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
each of the facilities is available to the applicable borrowers up to the aggregate committed credit and may be used for general corporate purposes  including as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs 
any borrowings under the credit facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and would bear interest at the rates set forth in the applicable credit agreement 

table of contents this billion of committed credit facilities consists of three separate five year credit facilities prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding are parties to a million five year credit facility that expires in may  which includes financial institutions  and a billion credit facility  of which million expires in december and billion expires in december  which includes financial institutions 
prudential financial is the sole borrower party to a separate billion five year credit facility that expires in november  which includes financial institutions 
prudential financial expects to borrow loans under the billion facility from time to time for general corporate purposes 
these credit facilities contain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type 
our ability to borrow under the facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including  for the facilities shared by prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding  the maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law and  in the case of each of the facilities  prudential financial s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth 
for the credit facilities shared by prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding  the minimum level of consolidated net worth of prudential financial is billion which for this purpose is calculated as us gaap equity  excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments 
for the credit facility on which prudential financial is the sole borrower party  the minimum level of consolidated net worth of prudential financial is billion  which for this purpose is calculated as us gaap equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   prudential insurance s total adjusted capital and prudential financial s consolidated net worth as defined in the applicable credit agreements exceeded the minimum amounts required to borrow under the facilities 
our ability to borrow under the facilities is not contingent on our credit ratings  nor subject to material adverse change clauses 
we also use uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions 
ratings financial strength ratings which are sometimes referred to as claims paying ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products 
nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate  including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries 
our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors  distributors or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability  liquidity and or capital 
in addition  we consider our own risk of non performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities 
therefore  changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities 

table of contents financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy

table of contents the ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
these ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock 
these ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future 
requirements to post collateral or make other payments  as a result of ratings downgrades  under certain agreements  including derivative agreements  can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
a ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of december  relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately million as of december  the amount of collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our derivative agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best to a for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately billion  based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate  that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately million  or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust 
we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
rating agencies use an outlook statement for both industry sectors and individual companies 
for an industry sector  a stable outlook generally implies that over the next months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector 
currently  am best  s p  moody s and fitch all have the am life insurance industry on stable outlook 
for a particular company  an outlook generally indicates a medium or long term trend generally six months to two years in credit fundamentals  which if continued  may lead to a rating change 
these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice 
am best  s p  moody s and fitch currently have all of the company s ratings on stable outlook 
in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  have requested additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels  such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
the following is a summary of the significant changes in our ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from the beginning of through the date of this filing 
on january   fitch downgraded the junior subordinated long term debt rating of prudential financial from bbb to bb 
the outlook on this rating is stable

contractual obligation the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
in addition  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows  such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments  nor all aspects of our cash outflows 
estimated payments due by period total and thereafter in millions short term and long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations commitments to purchase or fund investments commercial mortgage loan commitments other liabilities insurance liabilities other total the estimated payments due by period for long term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as estimated future interest payments 
the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short term and long term debt 
the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no significant capital lease obligations 
as discussed in note  we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
for further discussion of these separate account commitments  see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries asset management subsidiaries 
as discussed in note  loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 

table of contents the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  policyholder s dividends  reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current policies in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of  billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  cash collateral for loaned securities  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  and other miscellaneous liabilities 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and other contingencies in the course of our business  we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk 
the market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk vary by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate accounts in our variable life insurance and annuity products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management and derivative strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements within the context of market conditions and other relative opportunities 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
certain products supported by general account investments also expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts 
in a declining or sustained low interest rate environment  our ability to achieve desired spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed crediting rates associated with some of our variable life insurance and annuity products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate accounts associated with these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  we are exposed to the risk that asset based fees may decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
the risk of decreased asset based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
while a decrease in our estimates of total gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period  it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of interest rate  equity market  or market volatility changes may increase our net exposure to the guarantees under these contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we utilize product design elements such as asset allocation restrictions  an automatic rebalancing element and minimum purchase age requirements  in addition to externally purchased hedging instruments such as interest rate and equity based derivatives to help to hedge or limit our market risk exposure to the benefit features of certain of our variable annuity contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts  and the guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits associated with our variable annuity contracts 
for a discussion of asset based fees associated with our variable life products and our variable annuity contracts  our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the impact of our guaranteed minimum death and other benefits on the results of our individual life and individual annuities segments  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual 
table of contents life and group insurance division individual life and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
for risk management purposes we perform stress scenario testing to monitor the impact of extreme  but realistic adverse market events on our capital adequacy and liquidity 
this testing allows us to assess the sensitivity of our businesses to market factors and identify any concentrations of risk 
the regulatory capital levels and liquidity of our insurance companies in particular are closely monitored to ensure they remain consistent with our rating objectives 
changes to these ratings could impact our borrowing costs  our ability to access alternative sources of liquidity  and our ability to market certain products 
for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital resources see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
market fluctuations or changes in market conditions could also cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long term savings  protection and other investment products 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest rate and other market fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability see item a 
risk factors 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  retirement and annuities products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance and annuities products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage interest rate and equity exposure risk  as well as credit  liquidity and other risks  all within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 
for additional information regarding the management of our general account investments and our asset mix strategies  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments management of investments 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we use asset liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints by segment for each insurance entity 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the constraint limits 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our us regulatory cash flow for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest 
table of contents sensitive assumptions under various adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of both december  and with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  collectively referred to as investment contracts  and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates  reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk free rate 
the following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
as of december  notional fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities commercial mortgage and other loans policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt debt of consolidated variable interest entities investment contracts bank customer liabilities net estimated potential loss

the hypothetical change in fair value related to our variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives reflects only the gross fair value change on the embedded derivatives  and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes in fair value 
included in other liabilities together with all liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities 
the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  which are not considered financial liabilities 
we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities  including investment contracts  which are set forth in these tables 
our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of december  increased  million from december   primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in the increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in was primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value primarily driven by a net decrease in interest rates  mainly from risk free rates 
the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell for us equities 
for foreign equities we benchmark against the tokyo price index  or topix  and the msci eafe  a market index of european  australian  and far eastern equities 
we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated investment equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of 
table of contents december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us 
in addition to equity securities  as indicated above  we hold equity based derivatives primarily to hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products  as well as part of our capital hedging program described further below 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a million asset 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefits features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a million liability 
our estimated equity price risk associated with living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives  net of the related equity based derivatives used in our living benefits hedging program  was a million benefit as of december  and a million benefit as of december   estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels 
the higher sensitivity level as of december  primarily reflects the impact of our own risk of non performance on the embedded derivative liabilities  which does not have an offsetting impact on the hedge assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of our own risk of non performance on the valuation of the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in addition  we expanded our hedging program in the second quarter of to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business  including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures 
these capital hedges primarily consisted of equity based total return swaps that were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products 
our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges as of december  was a million benefit  estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels  which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline 
in  we changed the focus of our capital hedge program for the equity price risk associated with our variable annuities business to a broader view of equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the company as a whole 
in the second quarter of  we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the individual annuities segment and entered into equity index linked derivative transactions that are designed to mitigate the impact on statutory capital of a severe equity market stress event 
the program now focuses on tail risk rather than general equity market declines in order to protect our capital in a more cost effective manner under stress scenarios 
we continue to assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis  and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the company s risk position or other factors 
our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges as of december  was a million benefit  estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels  which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
these scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue  changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality  utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features 
in addition  these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk  such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
the impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity based derivatives and the related living benefit features  in comparison to the scenarios above 

table of contents market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios  other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and foreign currency liability issuances 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency risk first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan  korea  taiwan and europe 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
for our equity investments in our japanese and taiwanese operations  we generally hedge this exposure through a combination of issuing foreign denominated liabilities outside these operations and by holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations 
third  our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries investing in us dollar denominated investments 
most significantly  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments in their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations

the estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the increased var for foreign currency exchange risks primarily reflects increased volatility in exchange rates for japanese yen and korean won 
derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
we are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions 
we manage credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties  and by obtaining collateral where appropriate 
additionally  limits are set on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities and credit risk as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as well as equity prices  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts 
the notional amount of derivative instruments increased billion in  from billion as of december  to billion as of december   driven by an increase in interest rate derivatives  primarily related to our variable annuity hedging activities  and an increase in investment only  fee based stable value products sold in our retirement segment  which are accounted for as derivatives  as well as an increase in equity based derivatives related to our capital hedge program 
we use credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments  and purchase credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio 
for additional information regarding our exposure to credit derivatives  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our derivatives trading operations 
we maintain trading positions in various foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as 
table of contents well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
the total var for our trading activities  which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the largest component of this total var as of december  and was related to commodities price risk 
the total average daily var for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during both and the largest component of both periods total average daily var was related to commodities price risk 
limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
