item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
properties description of real property 
the locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at december  are set forth in the table beginning on page at december   our subsidiaries also operated medical office buildings  all of which were located on  or nearby  one of our general hospital campuses 
of those medical office buildings  were owned by our subsidiaries and were owned by third parties and leased by our subsidiaries 
our corporate headquarters are located in dallas  texas 
we have other corporate administrative offices in anaheim  california and coral springs  florida 
one of our subsidiaries leases our corporate headquarters space under an operating lease agreement that expires in december other subsidiaries lease the space for our offices in anaheim and coral springs under operating lease agreements 
we believe that all of our properties  including the administrative and medical office buildings described above  are suitable for their intended purposes 

table of contents obligations relating to real property 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding loans secured by property and equipment  and we had approximately million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  from time to time  we lease real property to third party developers for the construction of medical office buildings 
under our current practice  the financing necessary to construct the medical office buildings encumbers only the leasehold and not our fee interest in the real estate 
in years past  however  we have at times subordinated our fee interest and allowed our property to be pledged as collateral for third party loans 
we have no contractual obligation to make payments on these third party loans  but our property could be subject to loss in the case of default by the lessee 
regulations affecting real property 
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations affecting our use of  and purchase and sale of  real property 
among these are california s seismic standards  the americans with disabilities act  and various environmental laws and regulations 
the state of california has established standards intended to ensure that all hospitals in the state withstand earthquakes and other seismic activity without collapsing or posing the threat of significant loss of life 
in general  we are required to meet these standards by december   subject to a two year extension for hospital projects that are underway in advance of that date 
in november  the california building standards commission adopted regulations permitting the use of a new computerized evaluation tool for determining how at risk hospital buildings are of collapse in an earthquake  and the use of this new tool has resulted in fewer hospitals requiring retrofitting by the deadline 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million of which approximately million was spent prior to january  to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations compared to our estimate as of december  of approximately million 
our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using the new evaluation tool 
there may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the state of california completes its review of our other hospitals 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation 
in addition to safety standards  over time  hospitals must also meet performance standards meant to ensure that they are generally capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
ultimately  all general acute care hospitals in california must meet seismic performance standards by to remain open 
to date  we have conducted engineering studies and developed compliance plans for all of our california facilities 
at this time  all of our general acute care hospitals in california are in compliance with all current seismic requirements 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public accommodations  including hospitals and other health care facilities  be made accessible to disabled persons 
certain of our facilities are subject to a negotiated consent decree involving disability access as a result of a class action lawsuit 
in accordance with the terms of the consent decree  our facilities have agreed to implement disability access improvements  but have not admitted that they have engaged in any wrongful action or inaction 
through december   we spent approximately million on corrective work at our facilities  and we expect to spend approximately million more on such improvements over the next five years 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations  including with respect to asbestos abatement and the treatment of underground storage tanks  among other matters 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of complying with such laws  rules and regulations will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
medical staff and employees general 
our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of individual hospitals 
under state laws and other licensing standards  hospital medical staffs are generally self governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the hospital s local governing board 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us 
members of our medical staffs are free to terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals are not our employees 
however  nurses  therapists  lab technicians  facility maintenance workers and the administrative staffs of hospitals normally are our employees 
we are subject to federal minimum wage and hour laws and various state labor laws  and maintain a number of different employee benefit plans 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs in each of the last three years  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 

table of contents we continue to take steps to successfully attract and retain key employees  qualified physicians and other health care professionals 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the approximate number of our employees of which approximately were part time employees was as follows general hospitals and related health care facilities administrative offices total includes employees whose employment related to the operations of our general hospitals  critical access facility  long term acute care hospital  outpatient surgery centers  diagnostic imaging centers  occupational and rural health care clinics  physician practices  collection agency subsidiary and other health care operations 
at december   the largest concentrations of our employees excluding those in our administrative offices  but including those at our general hospitals and related health care facilities were in those states where we had the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds  as shown in the table below of employees of licensed beds florida california texas union activity and labor relations 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by various labor unions 
to date  labor unions represent registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our general hospitals  the majority of which are in california 
we are in the process of renegotiating the collective bargaining agreements for nearly all of these facilities 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from renegotiated agreements 
furthermore  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the renegotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
in addition  we have separate peace accords  which expire in december  with two labor unions that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize certain of our employees and set forth specific guidelines for the parties to follow with respect to organizing activities 
under the current terms of the peace accords  up to of our general hospitals may be subject to union organizing activities in in addition  certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts 
we are unable to predict the outcome of union organizing activities by labor unions and employees at this time 
we are also defending various allegations that we are in violation of federal labor laws or the terms of our collective bargaining agreements and peace accords  and we expect to continue to be subject to such claims from time to time in the normal course of business 
shortage of experienced nurses and mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
in addition to union activity  factors that adversely affect our labor costs include the nationwide shortage of experienced nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain key specialties and geographic areas 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we continually monitor our nurse staffing ratios in california in an effort to achieve full compliance with the state mandated nurse staffing ratios there 
nurse staffing ratio legislation has been proposed in  but not yet enacted by  congress and other states besides california in which we operate hospitals  including florida and pennsylvania 
in  texas passed the hospital safe staffing law  which mandates the creation of nurse staffing committees at texas hospitals and outlines each hospital s responsibility to adopt  implement and enforce an official nurse staffing plan  but does not mandate staffing ratios 
also in  the missouri department of health and senior services published amendments to the state s hospital nursing services regulations  which became effective on june   that are similar to the new texas requirements with respect to nurse staffing 

table of contents we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience salary  wage and benefit pressures created by the shortage of experienced nurses throughout the country and state mandated nurse staffing ratios  particularly in california 
in response  we have increased our efforts to recruit and retain experienced nurses and also to address workforce development with local schools of nursing 
we expect that of our hospitals will participate in the versant tm rn residency program in by providing an to week residency program for new nursing school graduates to help ease the transition from student to professional practicing nurse  give nurses evidence based experience and skills needed to increase their competency and confidence  reduce first year nurse turnover and decrease the use of contract labor 
competition in general  competition among health care providers occurs primarily at the local level 
a hospital s position within the geographic area in which it operates is affected by a number of competitive factors  including  but not limited to the scope  breadth and quality of services a hospital offers to its patients and physicians  the number  quality and specialties of the physicians who admit and refer patients to the hospital  nurses and other health care professionals employed by the hospital or on the hospital s staff  the hospital s reputation  its managed care contracting relationships  its location and the location and number of competitive facilities and other health care alternatives  the physical condition of the hospital s buildings and improvements  the quality  age and state of the art of its medical equipment  its parking or proximity to public transportation  the length of time it has been a part of the community  and the charges for its services 
in addition  tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
overall  our general hospitals and other health care businesses operate in highly competitive environments  and we believe the declines we have experienced in patient volumes over the last several years can be attributed  in part  to increased competition for physicians and patients 
we continue to take steps to address competition and increase patient volumes  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors  including local demographics and weather conditions  that affect patient volumes 
broadly speaking  we attract physicians by striving to equip our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment and quality physical plant  properly maintaining the equipment and physical plant  providing high quality care to our patients and otherwise creating an environment within which physicians prefer to practice 
one of our specific initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals and an increased number of our affiliated physicians in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have completed clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative tgi has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations 
however  the de emphasis or elimination of certain unprofitable service lines as a result of our tgi analysis will allow us to focus more resources on services that are in higher demand and are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative and medicare performance initiative are further helping position us competitively 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care  while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs 
we believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
as a result of our efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
leveraging off of these initiatives  we expect to benefit over time from provisions in the new federal health care law that tie payments to quality measures  establish a value based purchasing system and adjust hospital payment rates based on hospital acquired conditions and hospital readmissions 
in general  we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs  increasing payments from medicare and certain managed care payers for our services  and increasing physician and patient satisfaction  which may potentially improve our volumes 
further  each hospital has a local governing board  consisting primarily of community members and physicians  that develops short term and long term plans for the hospital to foster a desirable medical environment 
each local governing board also reviews and approves  as appropriate  actions of the medical staff  including staff appointments  credentialing  peer review and quality assurance 
while physicians may terminate their association with our hospitals at any time  we believe that by striving to maintain and improve the quality of care at our hospitals and by maintaining ethical and professional standards  we will attract and retain qualified physicians with a variety of specialties 

table of contents health care regulation and licensing affordable care act in march  president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of affordable care act into law 
the new law will result in sweeping changes across the health care industry 
the primary goal of this comprehensive legislation is to extend health coverage to approximately million uninsured legal us residents through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
to fund the expansion of insurance coverage  the legislation contains measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we are unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity  the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  gradual or potentially delayed implementation  pending court challenges and possible amendment 
however  we expect that several provisions of the affordable care act  including those described below  will have a material effect on our business 
public program reforms 
the affordable care act expands eligibility under existing medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level beginning in further  the law permits states to create federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid 
however  the affordable care act also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce medicare and medicaid program spending  including negative adjustments to the annual input price index  or market basket  updates for medicare s inpatient  outpatient  long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems  which began in  as well as additional productivity adjustments beginning in  and reductions to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in as the number of uninsured individuals declines 
any reductions to our reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs by the affordable care act could adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent such reductions are not offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals 
in addition  the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care provided to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
for example  the legislation expands payment penalties based on a hospital s rates of hospital acquired conditions hacs 
currently  medicare no longer assigns an inpatient hospital discharge to a higher paying medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group if a selected hac was not present on admission 
effective july   the affordable care act will likewise prohibit the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hacs 
beginning in federal fiscal year ffy  hospitals that fall into the top of national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will also receive a reduction in medicare payment rates 
for discharges occurring during ffys beginning on or after october   hospitals with excessive readmissions for certain conditions will receive reduced medicare payments for all inpatient admissions 
separately  under a medicare value based purchasing program that will be launched in ffy  hospitals that satisfy certain performance standards will receive increased payments for discharges during the following fiscal year 
these payments will be funded by decreases in payments to all hospitals for inpatient services 
for discharges occurring during ffy and after  the performance standards must assess hospital efficiency  including medicare spending per beneficiary 
in addition  the affordable care act directs cms to launch a national pilot program to study the use of bundled payments to hospitals  physicians and post acute care providers relating to a single admission to promote collaboration and alignment on quality and efficiency improvement 
the affordable care act also contains provisions relating to recovery audit contractors racs  which are third party organizations under contract with cms that identify underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program and recoup any overpayments on behalf of the government 
the affordable care act expands the rac program s scope to include medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with racs by december  health insurance market reforms 
the affordable care act contains provisions  which do not become effective until  requiring individuals to obtain  and employers to provide  insurance coverage 
in addition  the law requires states to establish a health insurance exchange 
the affordable care act also establishes a number of health insurance market reforms  including bans on lifetime limits and pre existing condition exclusions  new benefit mandates  and increased dependent coverage 
specifically  group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual coverage plans may not establish lifetime limits or  beginning january   annual limits on the dollar value of benefits  
table of contents may not rescind coverage of an enrollee  except in instances where the individual has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact  must reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place  and must continue to make dependent coverage available to unmarried dependents until age coverage for the dependents of unmarried adult children is not required effective for health plan policy years beginning on or after september  for plans that offer dependent coverage 
it is not clear what impact  if any  the increased obligations on managed care payers and other payers imposed by the affordable care act will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases 
the affordable care act also contains a number of other additional provisions  including provisions relating to the medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments  section of the social security act commonly referred to as the stark law  and qui tam or whistleblower actions  each of which is described in detail below  as well as provisions regarding the establishment of a center for medicare and medicaid innovation within cms  which will have the authority to develop and test new payment methodologies designed to improve the quality of care and lower costs  the creation of an independent payment advisory board that will make recommendations to congress regarding additional changes to provider payments and other aspects of the nation s health care system  and new taxes on manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical devices used by our hospitals  as well as a requirement that manufacturers file annual reports of payments made to physicians 
many of the law s provisions will not take effect for months or several years  while others became effective immediately 
many provisions also will require the federal government and individual state governments to interpret and implement the new requirements 
in addition  the affordable care act remains the subject of significant debate and efforts to repeal  block or amend the law by congress and many state legislatures 
finally  a number of state attorneys general and other parties have filed legal challenges to the affordable care act seeking to block its implementation on constitutional grounds 
some federal district court judges have issued rulings declaring all or key parts of the affordable care act unconstitutional  including the mandate that individuals purchase insurance  while several other federal courts have upheld the law 
it is expected that the united states supreme court will ultimately review the law and issue a final ruling on its constitutionality 
because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the reductions in medicare and medicaid spending  the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us 
in addition  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local health care regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
anti kickback and self referral regulations medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
the affordable care act amended the anti kickback statute to provide that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  under the affordable care act  submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal false claims act 
many states have statutes similar to the federal anti kickback statute  except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third party payers  not just federal programs 
in addition  it is a violation of the federal civil monetary penalties law to offer or transfer anything of value to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another 

table of contents the federal government has also issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
these regulations are often referred to as the safe harbor regulations 
the fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
rather  such conduct and business arrangements may be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and should be reviewed on a case by case basis 
in addition to addressing other matters  as discussed below  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa also amended title xi usc section et seq 
to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans  whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program 
the stark law generally restricts referrals by physicians of medicare or medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless one of several exceptions applies 
the referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined designated health services  such as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  radiology  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the exceptions to the referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships 
these statutory  and the subsequent regulatory  exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships  relocation arrangements  leases  group practice arrangements  medical directorships  and other common relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as hospitals 
a violation of the stark law may result in a denial of payment  required refunds to patients and the medicare program  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  for sham arrangements  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each day that an entity fails to report required information  and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal programs 
many states have adopted similar self referral statutes  some of which extend beyond the related state medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by the stark law and similar state enactments 
the affordable care act also made changes to the whole hospital exception in the stark law  effectively preventing new physician owned hospitals after march  and limiting the capacity and amount of physician ownership in existing physician owned hospitals 
as revised  the stark law prohibits physicians from referring medicare patients to a hospital in which they have an ownership or investment interest unless the hospital has physician ownership and a medicare provider agreement as of march  or  for those hospitals under development at the time of the affordable care act s enactment  as of december  
a physician owned hospital that meets these requirements will still be subject to restrictions that limit the hospital s aggregate physician ownership and  with certain narrow exceptions for hospitals with a high percentage of medicaid patients  prohibit expansion of the number of operating rooms  procedure rooms or beds 
the legislation also subjects a physician owned hospital to reporting requirements and extensive disclosure requirements on the hospital s website and in any public advertisements 
in accordance with our compliance program and our corporate integrity agreement with the federal government  which are described in detail under compliance program below  we have policies and procedures in place concerning compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  among others 
in addition  our compliance  law and audit services departments systematically review a substantial number of our arrangements with referral sources to determine the extent to which they comply with our policies and procedures and with the anti kickback statute  the stark law and similar state statutes 
health insurance portability and accountability act title ii  subtitle f of the health insurance portability and accountability act mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information 
hipaa s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the health care industry 
to protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity  hipaa also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed 
the law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
to receive reimbursement from cms for electronic claims  health care providers must use hipaa s electronic data transmission transaction and code set standards when transmitting certain health care information electronically 
our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current standards 

table of contents all covered entities  including those we operate  are also required to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa 
we are in material compliance with the privacy and security regulations  and we will continue to update training and procedures to address any compliance issues that develop 
further  all covered entities  including those we operate  have been assigned unique digit numeric identifiers and otherwise currently comply with the national provider identifier requirements of hipaa 
we have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with hipaa  and similar state privacy laws  under the guidance of our compliance department 
hospital compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our hipaa privacy and security policies and procedures at our hospitals 
we have also created an internal web based hipaa training program  which is mandatory for all employees 
based on existing and currently proposed regulations  as well as our experience with hipaa to this point  we continue to believe that the ongoing costs of complying with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
government enforcement efforts and qui tam lawsuits both federal and state government agencies continue heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts against the health care industry 
the operational mission of the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs is to protect the integrity of the medicare and medicaid programs and the well being of program beneficiaries by detecting and preventing waste  fraud and abuse  identifying opportunities to improve program economy  efficiency and effectiveness  and holding accountable those who do not meet program requirements or who violate federal laws 
the oig carries out its mission by conducting audits  evaluations and investigations and  when appropriate  imposing civil monetary penalties  assessments and administrative sanctions 
although we have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance in all material respects with the laws  rules and regulations affecting the health care industry  if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
health care providers are also subject to qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits under the federal false claims act fca  which allows private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the fca defines the term knowingly broadly 
though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the fca  submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the fca and  therefore  will qualify for liability 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the fca by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
under the affordable care act  the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due  whichever is later  constitutes a violation of the fca 
further  the affordable care act expands the scope of the fca to cover payments in connection with the new health insurance exchanges to be created by the legislation  if those payments include any federal funds 
qui tam actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves medicaid funds or funding from state and local agencies 
like other companies in the health care industry  we are subject to qui tam actions from time to time  however  we are unable to predict the future impact of such actions on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care facility licensing requirements in order to maintain their operating licenses  health care facilities must comply with strict governmental standards concerning medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our health care facilities hold all required governmental approvals  licenses and permits material to the operation of their business 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance in addition to certain statutory coverage limits and exclusions  federal laws and regulations  specifically the medicare conditions of participation  generally require health care providers  including hospitals that furnish or order health care services that may be paid for under the medicare program or state health care programs  to ensure that claims for reimbursement are for services or items that are provided economically and only when  and to the extent  they are medically reasonable and necessary  of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care  and supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality 
the social security act established the utilization and quality control peer review 
table of contents organization program  now known as the quality improvement organization qio program  to promote the effectiveness  efficiency  economy and quality of services delivered to medicare beneficiaries and to ensure that those services are reasonable and necessary 
cms administers the qio program through a network of qios that work with consumers  physicians  hospitals and other caregivers to refine care delivery systems to ensure patients receive the appropriate care at the appropriate time  particularly among underserved populations 
the qio program also safeguards the integrity of the medicare trust fund by reviewing medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges  and ensuring payment is made only for medically necessary services  and investigates beneficiary complaints about quality of care 
the qios have the authority to deny payment for services provided and recommend to hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with certain standards be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff doctors at each of our health care facilities  are overseen by each facility s local governing board  the members of which primarily are community members and physicians  and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel 
the local hospital governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care  develop short term and long range plans  and establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  as well as approves the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
certificate of need requirements some states require state approval for construction  expansion and closure of health care facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over health care facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
as of december   we operated hospitals in seven states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals 
we are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where they are required  or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and  thereby  affect our competitive position 
environmental matters our health care operations are subject to a number of federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations that govern  among other things  our disposal of solid waste  as well as our use  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials including radiological materials 
our operations also generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with laws and regulations that vary from state to state 
in addition  although we are not engaged in manufacturing or other activities that produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions  our operating expenses could be adversely affected if legal and regulatory developments related to climate change or other initiatives result in increased energy or other costs 
we could also be affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy or result in severe weather or climate change events affecting the communities in which our facilities are located 
at this time  based on current climate conditions and our assessment of existing and pending environmental rules and regulations  as well as treaties and international accords relating to climate change  we do not believe that the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  including regulations relating to climate change issues  will have a material adverse effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with our commitment to meet the highest standards of corporate responsibility  we have formed a corporate committee to regularly evaluate our environmental policies and to share best practices among our hospitals by identifying opportunities to reduce waste  use safer chemicals and consume less energy while at the same time managing costs prudently 
these efforts  among other things  have resulted in the substantial elimination of the use of mercury at our health care facilities and the adoption of corporate wide recycling and other programs 
we also seek to implement these objectives through our procurement practices by contracting with health care product suppliers and other organizations that endorse environmental and safety goals consistent with our corporate philosophy 

table of contents compliance program general 
we maintain a multi faceted corporate and hospital based compliance program that is designed to help our corporate and hospital staff meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice 
we established an independent compliance department in to manage compliance related functions previously managed by our law department 
to ensure the independence of the compliance department  the following measures were implemented the compliance department has its own operating budget  the compliance department has the authority to hire outside counsel  access any tenet document and interview any of our personnel  and our chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors has approved an updated ethics and compliance program charter that furthers our goal of fostering and maintaining the highest ethical standards  and valuing our compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations as a foundation of our corporate philosophy 
the primary focus of the program is compliance with the requirements of the medicare and medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs 
pursuant to the terms of the charter  the compliance department is responsible for the following activities drafting company policies and procedures related to ethics and compliance issues  developing and providing compliance related education and training to all of our employees and  as appropriate  directors  contractors  agents and staff physicians  creating and disseminating our standards of conduct  monitoring  responding to and resolving all ethics and compliance related issues  ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified  and measuring compliance with our policies and legal and regulatory requirements related to federal health care programs and our corporate integrity agreement described below 
corporate integrity agreement 
in june  we entered into a broad civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice doj and other federal agencies that concluded several previously disclosed governmental investigations  including inquiries into our receipt of certain medicare outlier payments before  physician financial arrangements and medicare coding issues 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia in september with the oig 
the cia establishes annual training requirements and compliance reviews by independent review organizations in specific areas 
in particular  the cia requires  among other things  that we maintain our existing company wide quality initiatives in the areas of evidence based medicine  standards of clinical excellence and quality measurements  maintain our existing company wide compliance program and code of conduct  formalize in writing our policies and procedures in the areas of billing and reimbursement  compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  and clinical quality  almost all of which were already in place when we entered into the cia and the remainder of which were put into place by january  provide a variety of general and specialized compliance training to our employees  contractors and physicians we employ or who serve as medical directors and or serve on our hospitals governing boards  and engage independent outside entities iros to provide reviews of compliance and effectiveness in five areas medicare outlier payments  diagnosis related group claims  unallowable costs  physician financial arrangements and clinical quality systems 
because the iro we engaged to review our compliance and effectiveness with respect to diagnosis related group claims identified very few coding errors in the first three annual reporting periods of the cia  we requested and the oig agreed that for the fourth reporting period of the cia  the iro would instead review medicare inpatient admissions ranging from zero to two days 
further  the cia requires us to maintain or establish performance standards and incentives that link compensation and incentive awards directly to clinical quality measures and compliance program effectiveness measures 
the cia also establishes a number of specific requirements for the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
notably  the committee must retain an independent compliance expert  and assess our compliance program  including arranging for the performance of a review of the effectiveness of the program 
based on this work  the committee must then adopt a resolution for each reporting period of the cia regarding its conclusions as to whether we have implemented an effective compliance program 

table of contents the cia has the effect of increasing the amount of information we provide the federal government regarding our health care practices and our compliance with federal regulations 
the reports we provide could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
in addition  any determination that we have breached our cia or violated applicable health care laws or regulations could subject us to repayment obligations  civil and monetary penalties  exclusion from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and  for violations of certain laws and regulations  criminal penalties 
we have taken  and continue to take  all necessary steps to promote compliance with the terms of the cia 
ethics program we maintain a values based ethics program that is designed to monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and to stress the importance of understanding and complying with our standards of conduct 
all of our employees  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer  are required to abide by our standards of conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a legal and ethical manner 
the members of our board of directors and many of our contractors are also required to abide by our standards of conduct 
the standards reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies  procedures and practices 
our standards cover such areas as quality patient care  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  appropriate use of our assets  protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest 
as part of the program  we provide annual ethics and compliance training sessions to every employee  as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors 
all employees are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the standards of conduct  and are encouraged to contact our hour toll free ethics action line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns 
incidents of alleged financial improprieties reported to the ethics action line or the compliance department are communicated to the audit committee of our board of directors 
all reports to the ethics action line are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law  and employees have the option to remain anonymous 
in cases reported to the ethics action line that involve a possible violation of the law or regulatory policies and procedures  the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation 
retaliation against employees in connection with reporting ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our standards of conduct  and  if it occurs  it will result in discipline  up to and including termination of employment 
the full text of our standards of conduct  and a number of our ethics and compliance policies and procedures  are published on our website  at www 
tenethealth

a copy of our standards of conduct is also available upon written request to our corporate secretary

property and professional and general liability insurance property insurance 
we have property  business interruption and related insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of catastrophic events or perils that is subject to deductible provisions based on the terms of the policies 
these policies are on an occurrence basis 
for the policy periods april  through march  and april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate

deductibles are of insured values up to a maximum of million for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  and of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  with a maximum per claim deductible of million 
other covered losses  including fires and other perils  have a minimum deductible of million 
professional and general liability insurance 
as is typical in the health care industry  we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional liability insurance due to increased litigation 
in response  we formed and maintain captive insurance companies to self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability risk 
claims in excess of our self insurance retentions are insured with commercial insurance companies 
for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
our captive insurance company  the healthcare insurance corporation thinc  retains million per occurrence above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
the next million of claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are reinsured by thinc with independent reinsurance companies  with thinc retaining or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million  with tenet retaining of the initial million layer in excess of million per claim or a maximum of million 

table of contents for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
thinc retains million per occurrence coverage above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
the next million of claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are reinsured by thinc with independent reinsurance companies  with thinc retaining or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
if the aggregate limit of any of our excess professional and general liability policies is exhausted  in whole or in part  it could deplete or reduce the excess limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
in addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries  we maintain reserves  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  for our self insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies aggregate limits  based on actuarial estimates of losses and related expenses 
also  we provide standby letters of credit to certain of our insurers  which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances  to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations 
if one or more of the events discussed in the following risks were to occur  actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the sec  and our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also negatively affect our business and operations 
in either case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
if we are unable to enter into and retain managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable terms  if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the year ended december  was billion  which represented approximately of our total net patient revenues 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
in the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
in addition  at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable were due from managed care payers 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us 
other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into acceptable managed care contractual arrangements or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions 
for example  some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us 
furthermore  managed care payers are continuing to demand discounted fee structures  and the trend toward consolidation among these payers tends to increase their bargaining power 
in some cases  commercial managed care payers rely on all or portions of medicare s severity adjusted diagnosis related group system to determine payment rates  which could result in decreased reimbursement from some of these payers if levels of payments to health care providers or payment methodologies under the medicare program are changed 
other changes to government health care programs  such as the increased obligations on managed care payers imposed by the affordable care act  may negatively impact payments from managed care payers and our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases 
any material reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services  coupled with any difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we cannot predict with certainty the effect that the affordable care act may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as enacted  the affordable care act will change how health care services are covered  delivered and reimbursed 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the law may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
in addition  a disproportionately large percentage of the new medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements 
two such states are florida and texas  where nearly half of our licensed beds are currently located 
on the other hand  the affordable care act provides for significant reductions in the growth of medicare spending and reductions in medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments 
a significant portion of both our patient volumes and  as result  our revenues is derived from government health care programs  principally medicare and medicaid 
reductions to our reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs by the affordable care act could adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent such reductions are not offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals 
we are unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity and the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the law 
furthermore  many of the provisions of the affordable care act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until or later 
in addition  the affordable care act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates  such as the requirement to establish health insurance exchanges and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities  and we are unable to predict the timing and impact of such changes at this time 
it is also possible that implementation of the affordable care act could be delayed or even blocked due to court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law 
further changes in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government health care programs could have an adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net patient revenues were received from the medicare program  and approximately of our net patient revenues were received from various state medicaid programs  in each case excluding medicare and medicaid managed care programs 
in addition to the changes affected by the affordable care act  the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to other statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities  which could in turn adversely affect our overall business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
moreover  the current economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on many states  and these budgetary pressures have resulted  and likely will continue to result  in decreased spending for medicaid programs and the children s health insurance program in several of the states in which we operate 
most states began a new fiscal year on july  and  although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets  some states are facing mid year budget gaps 
any shortfalls  now or in the future  whether as a result of the economic downturn  the expansion of medicaid coverage under the affordable care act or otherwise  could result in additional reductions to medicaid payments or additional taxes on hospitals 
further  many states have adopted  or are considering  legislation designed to enroll medicaid recipients in managed care programs and or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states medicaid systems 
in general  we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business continues to be adversely affected by a high volume of uninsured and underinsured patients  as well as declines in commercial managed care patients 
like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with increased burdens of co payments and deductibles due to changes in their health care plans 
as a result  we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients as a result of the affordable care act or otherwise  the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  or the economy improves and unemployment rates decline  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase 
in addition  even after implementation of the affordable care act  we may continue to experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program 

table of contents over the past several years  we have experienced declines in our commercial managed care volumes  which in the aggregate generate substantially higher yields than medicare and medicaid volumes 
the declines in our commercial managed care volumes are due  in part  to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment 
in addition  we believe our commercial managed care volumes may have been adversely impacted by the expiration of federal subsidies for those unemployed individuals and their family members who have been receiving subsidized continued health insurance coverage under their former employers health plans 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and competition is one reason for declines we may experience in patient volumes 
overall  our general hospitals and other health care businesses operate in highly competitive environments  and we believe the declines we have experienced in patient volumes over the last several years can be attributed  in part  to increased competition for physicians and patients 
generally  other hospitals in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals 
some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
these tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
we also face increased competition from specialty hospitals some of which are physician owned and unaffiliated freestanding surgery  diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
if competing health care providers are better able to attract patients  recruit and retain physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  our patient volume levels may suffer 
if we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  our business may suffer 
the success of our business depends in significant part on the number  quality and specialties of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  the admitting practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets we serve  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals 
such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of quality physicians by providing adequate support personnel  technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients  physicians may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities  admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
our labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing  the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel  including nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians  as well as our employed physicians 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining physicians and qualified management responsible for the daily operations of our hospitals 
in addition  like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain key specialties and geographic areas 
as a result  from time to time  we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced nurses or hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel 
furthermore  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
in general  our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  experienced nurses and other medical support personnel  or to control labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by various labor unions 
to date  labor unions represent employees at of our general hospitals  and we are in the process of renegotiating the collective bargaining agreements for nearly all of these facilities 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from renegotiated agreements 
moreover  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the renegotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
in addition  under the current terms of the peace accords we have with two labor unions  up to of our general hospitals may be subject to union organizing activities in  and certain 
table of contents potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts 
we are unable to predict the outcome of union organizing activities by labor unions and employees at this time  however  to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionizes  it is possible our labor costs could increase materially 
our licensed hospital beds are heavily concentrated in certain market areas in florida  texas and california  which makes us sensitive to economic  regulatory  environmental and other conditions in those areas 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our general hospitals were in florida  texas and california 
these concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other condition occur in these areas  our overall business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration  and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover our losses 
in the past  hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida and texas and the patient populations in those states 
our california operations could be adversely affected by a major earthquake or wildfires in that state 
moreover  we currently expect to spend a total of approximately million unadjusted for inflation to comply with the requirements of california s seismic regulations for hospitals  of which approximately million was spent prior to january  our business and financial results could be harmed by violations of existing regulations or compliance with new or changed regulations 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations 
even the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and our business reputation could suffer 
furthermore  health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are also required to comply with various federal and state labor laws  rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues 
from time to time  we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws  rules and regulations 
the current economic downturn and other economic factors have impacted  and may continue to impact  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to be impacted by a number of industry wide challenges  including declines in patient volumes and high levels of bad debt 
we believe factors associated with the current economic downturn including higher levels of unemployment  reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  and patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and non emergency health care procedures have had some impact on our volumes and have affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
if industry trends or general economic conditions worsen  we may not be able to sustain future profitability  and our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed 
furthermore  the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide has been limited in recent years 
our ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets  which could have a negative impact on our growth plans  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions  and our ability to refinance existing debt 
the current economic downturn or other economic conditions could also adversely affect the counterparties to our agreements  including the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may lead to charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of factors that have affected our industry generally and our business specifically  we have been required to record various charges in our results of operations 
our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results in our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospital s 
table of contents most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill 
any such charges could adversely affect our results of operations 
the amount and terms of our current and any future debt could  among other things  adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total long term debt  as well as approximately million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of all of our wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals 
from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
the terms and conditions in our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes  and our payment obligations under these agreements  could have important consequences to our business and to holders of our securities  including the following our credit agreement and the indentures contain  and any future debt obligations may contain  covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain a financial ratio relating to our ability to satisfy certain fixed expenses  including interest payments 
the indentures governing our outstanding senior secured notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens  consummate asset sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions or consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our or their assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business  in the health care industry or in the economy generally  or if federal or state governments set further limitations on reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs 
we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for our operations  capital expenditures or acquisitions 
we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to the restrictions contained in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
the unsolicited acquisition proposal we received in november and the proxy contest initiated in january may require the expenditure of significant time and resources and create uncertainty that could adversely affect our business 
on november   we received an unsolicited proposal from community health systems  inc community to acquire all outstanding shares of tenet healthcare corporation for per share in cash and stock 
our board of directors  after carefully evaluating the proposal made by community and after consultation with our financial and legal advisors  unanimously determined that community s proposal was not in the best interests of the company or our shareholders 
on january   community initiated a proxy contest by nominating candidates for election to our board of directors at our annual meeting of shareholders 
community s offer and the proxy contest may create uncertainty for our employees  which could adversely affect our ability to retain key employees and hire new talent 
community s actions may also create uncertainty for current and potential business partners  which could cause them to terminate  or not to renew or enter into  arrangements with us 
furthermore  the proxy contest may require the expenditure of significant time and resources by the company and our management 
in addition  the company and our board of directors are defendants in six purported shareholder class action complaints relating to community s proposal as more fully described in item  legal proceedings  of this report 
these lawsuits or any future similar or related lawsuits may become time consuming and expensive 
in general  all of these consequences  alone or in combination  may harm our business 

table of contents the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
because of net operating losses we have experienced for federal income tax purposes  at december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion pretax available to offset future taxable income 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period 
these ownership changes include the offering of stock by us  the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders  as defined in the treasury regulations  or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock 
if such ownership changes by shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed percentage points during the three year period  then section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by our nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change 
the limitation may affect the amount of our deferred income tax asset and  depending on the limitation  a significant portion of our nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards could expire before we are able to use them 
in such an event  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we believe that we have not experienced an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code as of february   however  the amount by which our ownership may change in the future could be affected by purchases and sales of stock by shareholders  the conversion of our outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock and new issuances of stock by us  should we choose to do so 
in january  our board of directors adopted a section rights agreement as a measure intended to deter such ownership changes in order to preserve our nol carryforwards 
the section rights agreement may not prevent an ownership change  however 
in addition  while the section rights agreement is in effect  it could discourage or prevent a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or accumulations of substantial blocks of shares for which some shareholders might receive a premium above market value 
it could also adversely affect the liquidity of the market for our stock

we are currently a party to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings  including those reported below 
shareholder suits in december and january  six purported shareholder class action complaints were filed against the company and our board of directors  each ostensibly brought on behalf of all tenet shareholders who allegedly have been or will be harmed by the actions or inactions of our board of directors in response to the unsolicited acquisition proposal we received from community in november the six actions are martin weber  et al

the complaint in each of these actions generally alleges that the members of our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by their actions and inactions in response to community s proposal and that the company aided and abetted the actions of the individual directors 
in general  each of the plaintiffs seeks injunctive relief prohibiting the company and our board of directors from implementing defensive measures  such as poison pills  in response to community s proposal  seeks rescission of defensive measures already adopted  or both 
the company and our board of directors believe that each of these actions is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against each of these actions 

table of contents governmental reviews certain of our hospitals are parties to the following regulatory reviews  each of which has been previously reported 
our analysis of several of these matters is still ongoing  and we are unable to predict the timing and outcome of these reviews at this time 
inpatient rehabilitation facilities review 
pursuant to our corporate integrity agreement  we notified the office of inspector general in october that we had completed a preliminary review of admissions to our inpatient rehabilitation unit at south fulton medical center in east point  georgia that suggested further review was necessary to determine whether south fulton had received medicare overpayments reportable under our cia 
in january  we submitted this matter into the oig s voluntary self disclosure protocol 
the oig subsequently accepted our submission 
in february  we received a letter from the department of justice  which is participating in this matter with the oig  requesting additional information regarding the basis for our self disclosure  as well as information related to admissions at our other active and divested inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units for the period to the date of the letter 
the government has since limited the scope of its review to the period may  through december  in addition  the government asked to examine a limited sample of patient files at two inpatient rehabilitation facilities besides south fulton before it determines if its review should extend to our other inpatient rehabilitation units 
that examination was completed and presented to the government in march we continue to fully cooperate with the doj and the oig regarding their review 
kyphoplasty review 
the doj  through the us attorney s office in the western district of new york  in conjunction with the oig  has contacted a number of hospitals  including several of our hospitals  requesting information regarding their billing practices for kyphoplasty procedures 
kyphoplasty is a surgical procedure used to treat pain and related conditions associated with certain vertebrae injuries 
the government requested the information in connection with its review of the appropriateness of medicare patients receiving kyphoplasty procedures on an inpatient as opposed to an outpatient basis 
we continue to fully cooperate with the government regarding its review 
review of florida medical center s partial hospitalization program 
in february  the fiscal intermediary for our florida medical center began a probe review of the group billing practices of that facility s partial hospitalization program  a psychiatric treatment program that had the capacity to treat patients on an outpatient basis 
we also examined the records reviewed by the fiscal intermediary and independently determined that patients had multiple outpatient admissions with lengths of stay longer than expected for this program 
as a result of our review of this matter  we closed the program and  pursuant to our cia  notified the oig about our findings in june in november  we submitted this matter into the oig s voluntary self disclosure protocol 
we continue to fully cooperate with the government regarding its review 
review of icd implantation procedures 
in march  the doj issued a civil investigative demand cid pursuant to the federal false claims act to one of our hospitals 
the cid requested information regarding medicare claims submitted by our hospital in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds during the period to the date of the letter 
the government is seeking this information to determine if icd implantation procedures were performed in accordance with medicare coverage requirements 
in september  the doj notified us that it also intends to review records and documents from a number of our other hospitals in addition to the hospital that originally received the cid 
we understand that the doj has submitted similar requests to other hospital companies as well 
we continue to fully cooperate with the government regarding its review  to date  the doj has not asserted any claim against our hospitals 
wage and hour actions as previously reported  we are defendants in two coordinated lawsuits in los angeles superior court alleging that our hospitals violated certain provisions of california s labor laws and applicable wage and hour regulations 
the cases are mcdonough  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation which was filed june and tien  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation which was filed in may 
the plaintiffs in both cases allege that our hospitals violated certain provisions of the california labor code and applicable california industrial welfare commission wage orders with respect to meal breaks  rest periods and the payment of compensation for meal breaks or rest periods not taken 
the complaint in the tien case also alleges that we have improperly rounded off time entries on timekeeping records and that our pay stubs do not include all information required by california law 
the plaintiffs in both cases have sought back pay  statutory penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
the plaintiffs in the mcdonough and tien cases filed motions  which we opposed  to certify these actions on behalf of virtually all nonexempt employees of our california hospital subsidiaries  as separated into four classes and one subclass based on the specific claims at issue 
the plaintiffs requests for class certification were initially granted in part and denied in part in june however  we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s class certification ruling and  in november  the 
table of contents court issued a reconsidered ruling denying class certification with respect to all of the plaintiffs claims except the claim relating to one subclass that the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed in december the plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision in february oral arguments in the appeal were held on january  and  on february   the court of appeal affirmed the lower court s november ruling 
we are also subject from time to time to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning the application of various federal and state labor laws  rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues 
class action lawsuits resulting from hurricane katrina when hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast region in august  we owned five hospitals and a number of imaging centers in the new orleans area 
as previously reported  three lawsuits were filed as purported class actions in late by and on behalf of patients  their family members and others who were present and allegedly injured at two of those hospitals memorial medical center and lindy boggs medical center each of which we have since divested during the storm and its aftermath 
the plaintiffs allege that the hospitals were negligent in failing to properly prepare for the storm  failing to evacuate patients ahead of the storm  and failing to have a properly configured emergency generator system  among other allegations of general negligence 
the plaintiffs are seeking damages in various and unspecified amounts for the alleged wrongful death of some patients  aggravation of pre existing illnesses or injuries to patients who survived and were successfully evacuated  and the inability of patients and others to evacuate the hospitals for several days under challenging conditions 
in september  class certification was granted in two of the suits preston  et al 
v 
tenet healthsystem memorial medical center  inc  et al 
and husband et al 
v 
tenet healthsystem memorial medical center  inc  et al 
in her order  the judge certified a class of all persons at memorial medical center between august and september   excluding employees  who sustained injuries or died  as well as family members who themselves sustained injury as a result of such injuries or deaths to any person at the hospital  excluding employees  during that time 
our appeals of the class certification ruling were exhausted in december when the supreme court of louisiana denied our writ of certiorari 
the civil district court for the parish of orleans will administer the class proceedings 
a trial of bellwether plaintiffs claims which is a set of plaintiffs claims deemed representative of claims by all class members is currently scheduled to begin in march the class certification hearing in the remaining case dunn  et al 
v 
tenet mid city medical  llc formerly d b a lindy boggs medical center  et al  which was also filed in the civil district court for the parish of orleans has been postponed and not rescheduled at the request of the plaintiffs attorneys 
we are unable to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits  but we intend to continue to vigorously defend the hospitals in these matters 
ordinary course matters in addition to the matters described above  our hospitals are subject to investigations  claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business 
most of these matters involve allegations of medical malpractice or other injuries suffered at our hospitals 
our hospitals are also routinely subject to sales and use tax audits and personal property tax audits by the state and local government jurisdictions in which they do business 
the results of the audits are frequently disputed  and such disputes are ordinarily resolved by administrative appeals or litigation

this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it includes the following sections management overview sources of revenue results of operations liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements recently issued accounting standards critical accounting estimates management overview recent developments california provider fee program approved in january  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued the final required federal approval of california s program to impose a provider fee on hospitals that  combined with federal matching funds  will be used to provide supplemental medi cal payments to hospitals in the state 
the program was enacted to provide supplemental medi cal payments for up to months retroactive to april and expiring on december  based on the most recent modeling prepared by the california hospital association  we estimate that revenues under the program  net of provider fees and other expenses  for our california hospitals will be approximately million for the full month period of the plan 
we will recognize the approximately million of net revenues in the three months ending march  strategy and trends we are committed to providing the communities our hospitals and other health care facilities serve with high quality  cost effective health care while growing our business  increasing our profitability and creating long term value for our shareholders 
we believe that our success in increasing our profitability depends in part on our success in executing the following strategies and managing the following trends 

table of contents core business strategy at december   our subsidiaries operated general hospitals  including four academic medical centers  and a critical access hospital  with a combined total of  licensed beds  serving primarily urban and suburban communities in states 
our core business is focused on providing acute care treatment  including inpatient care  intensive care  cardiac care  radiology services and emergency medical treatment 
in supporting our core business  we seek to offer superior quality and patient services  to make capital and other investments in our facilities and technology to be competitive  to recruit and retain physicians  and to negotiate favorable contracts with managed care and other commercial payers 
in addition  we continually review our clinical service lines to determine which services are most highly valued and should be marketed to improve our operating results  and we strategically de emphasize or eliminate unprofitable service lines  if appropriate 
commitment to quality through our commitment to quality initiative and medicare performance initiative  we continually work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care  while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs 
we believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
as a result of our efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
leveraging off of these initiatives  we expect to benefit over time from provisions in the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of affordable care act that tie payments to quality measures  establish a value based purchasing system and adjust hospital payment rates based on hospital acquired conditions and hospital readmissions 
in general  we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs  increasing payments from medicare and certain managed care payers for our services  and increasing physician and patient satisfaction  which may potentially improve our volumes 
development strategies we continue to focus on opportunities to increase our outpatient revenues through organic growth and the acquisition of selected outpatient businesses 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from outpatient services 
historically  our outpatient business has generated significantly higher margins for us than other business lines 
by expanding our outpatient business  we expect to increase our profitability over time 
during the year ended december   we acquired various outpatient centers in california  florida  missouri  new mexico  south carolina  tennessee and texas 
we also intend to focus on acquiring hospitals and other health care assets and companies in markets where we believe our operating strategies can improve performance and create shareholder value 
we believe that this growth by strategic acquisition  when and if opportunities are available  can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets 
impact of affordable care act we anticipate that we will benefit over time from the provisions of the affordable care act that will extend insurance coverage through medicaid or private insurance to a broader segment of the us population 
although we are unable to predict the precise impact of the affordable care act on our future results of operations  and while there will be some reductions in reimbursement rates  which began in  we anticipate  based on the current timetable for implementing the law  that we could begin to receive reimbursement for caring for uninsured and underinsured patients as early as we believe we are well positioned relative to other health care companies to benefit from extended insurance coverage given the concentration of our operations in california  florida and texas  which states historically have higher percentages of uninsured and underinsured patients compared to the national average 
capturing hit incentive payments and other benefits based on our current timeframe for achieving compliance with the health information technology hit requirements under the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  we expect that the operating costs we currently are incurring to invest in hit systems will be partially offset beginning in as we begin to receive medicare and medicaid hospital incentive payments provided under arra 
moreover  we believe that the operational benefits of hit  including improved clinical outcomes and increased operating efficiencies  will contribute to our long term ability to grow our business 
counteracting declines in patient volumes we continue to experience declines in patient volumes because of the impact of the current economic downturn  increased competition  utilization pressure by managed care organizations and demographic trends 
in an effort to increase patient volumes  we continue to focus on physician alignment and satisfaction  targeting our capital spending on critical growth opportunities for our hospitals  emphasizing higher demand clinical service lines including outpatient lines  implementing new payer contracting strategies  and improving the quality metrics of our hospitals 
general economic conditions we believe that the economic downturn continues to have a negative impact on our bad debt expense levels and patient volumes  reflecting the impact of current high unemployment rates and other depressed economic conditions 
however  as the economy recovers  we expect to experience an improvement in these metrics relative to current levels 

table of contents expanding our revenue cycle management business we intend to continue expanding our revenue cycle management and patient communications services businesses under our conifer health solutions conifer subsidiary 
at december   conifer provided revenue cycle services to approximately non tenet hospitals 
we believe this business has the potential over time to generate higher margins and improve our results of operations 
our ability to execute on these strategies and manage these trends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from expectations 
for information about these risks and uncertainties  see item a  risk factors  of this report 
results of operations overview our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges  including decreased volumes  decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt  that have affected our revenue growth and operating expenses 
we believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes  revenues and expenses  therefore  we have provided below information about these metrics for the three months ended december  and for all of our continuing operations hospitals 
three months ended december  admissions  patient days and surgeries increase decrease total admissions paying admissions excludes charity and uninsured charity and uninsured admissions admissions through emergency department paying admissions as a percentage of total admissions charity and uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions surgeries inpatient surgeries outpatient total surgeries patient days total adjusted patient days average length of stay days adjusted patient admissions the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
total admissions declined by  or  in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in three of our four regions and our philadelphia market reported admissions declines in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  surgeries declined by in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  while our emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions increased in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year  we believe the current economic conditions have had an adverse impact on the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals  which contributed to the overall decline in our total admissions 
furthermore  there were flu related admissions in the three months ended december  as compared to in the same period in  a decline of 

table of contents three months ended december  outpatient visits increase decrease total visits paying visits excludes charity and uninsured charity and uninsured visits emergency department visits surgery visits paying visits as a percentage of total visits charity and uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  we had an increase of  total outpatient visits  or  in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  our california  central and florida regions reported increased outpatient visits  while our southern states region and our philadelphia market reported declines in outpatient visits in the three months ended december  the increase in florida region visits is primarily attributable to the various outpatient centers we acquired in september outpatient surgery visits increased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in charity and uninsured outpatient visits increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  three months ended december  revenues increase decrease net operating revenues revenues from the uninsured net inpatient revenues net outpatient revenues net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues 
net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of million and for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of million and million for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
net operating revenues increased by million  or  for the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in unfavorable prior year cost report adjustments of approximately million reduced net operating revenues in the three months ended december  as compared to favorable adjustments of million in the three months ended december  primarily as a result of managed care pricing improvement  including a increase in our commercial inpatient acuity and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix  as well as a increase in outpatient visits  net patient revenues increased by despite the decline in total admissions in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in three months ended december  revenues on a per admission  per patient day and per visit basis increase decrease net inpatient revenue per admission net inpatient revenue per patient day net outpatient revenue per visit net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission net patient revenue per adjusted patient day adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 

table of contents unit revenue improvement was evident across all key metrics  primarily reflecting the improved terms of our managed care contracts and the provision of higher acuity services in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in the growth in net inpatient revenue per admission of was constrained by an unfavorable shift in our total payer mix  including a decline in managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  three months ended december  selected operating expenses increase decrease salaries  wages and benefits supplies other operating expenses total rent lease expense salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day supplies per adjusted patient day other operating expenses per adjusted patient day total per adjusted patient day included in other operating expenses 
adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
total selected operating expenses  which is defined as salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses  decreased by on a per adjusted patient day basis in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day decreased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily due to decreased accruals for annual incentive compensation and discretionary contribution expense of million in the period for contributions to the k plan accounts of employees who were not eligible for incentive compensation awards  partially offset by an increase in health benefits costs 
supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the increased use of prostheses and high cost implants  partially offset by decreases in the cost of pacemakers and pharmaceuticals 
a portion of the increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers 
other operating expenses per adjusted patient day decreased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in malpractice expense  a favorable adjustment of million relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to april on behalf of medical residents and reductions in consulting costs  property taxes and rent expense as compared to the same period in the decrease in malpractice expense is significantly attributable to an basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities  which resulted in a million reduction in malpractice expense in the three months ended december   and improved claims experience 
these decreases were partially offset by the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage  increases in the costs of repairs  maintenance and technology service contracts  increased physician relocation costs  increased physician and medical fees  a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations  increased costs of contracted services  increased advertising expenses and increased hospital provider taxes  which were substantially offset by additional disproportionate share hospital payments recognized in revenues

the table below shows the sources of net patient revenues for our general hospitals  expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources years ended december  net patient revenues from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other 
table of contents our payer mix on an admissions basis for our general hospitals  expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources  is shown below years ended december  admissions from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services of the us department of health and human services hhs 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poor and most vulnerable individuals 
as enacted  the affordable care act will change how health care services under medicare  medicaid and other government programs are covered  delivered and reimbursed 
among other things  the affordable care act expands eligibility under existing medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level beginning in further  the law permits states to create federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid 
however  the affordable care act also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce medicare and medicaid program spending  including negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for medicare inpatient  outpatient  long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems  which began in  as well as additional productivity adjustments beginning in  and reductions to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in as the number of uninsured individuals declines 
we are unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity  the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  gradual or potentially delayed implementation  pending court challenges and possible amendment 
however  we expect that several provisions of the affordable care act will have a material effect on our business 
in addition to the changes affected by the affordable care act  the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to other statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited  or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents medicare medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage  includes health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  private fee for service medicare special needs plans and medicare medical savings account plans 
the major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below years ended december  revenue descriptions medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group operating medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group capital outlier outpatient disproportionate share direct graduate and indirect medical education other adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances total medicare net patient revenues includes indirect medical education ime revenue earned by our children s hospital under the children s hospitals graduate medical education payment program administered by the health resources and services administration of hhs 
the other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility which we sold in the three months ended june   inpatient psychiatric units  one inpatient rehabilitation hospital which we closed in the three months ended march   inpatient rehabilitation units  one long term acute care hospital  other revenue adjustments  and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances 
a general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan is provided below 
recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found below under regulatory and legislative changes 
acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system pps 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a system of medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups ms drgs  which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each ms drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular ms drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all ms drgs 
the base payment amount for the operating component of the ms drg payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs  respectively 
using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital  cms assigns to each discharge an ms drg  and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the ms drg assigned 
the ms drg operating and capital base rates  relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually  with consideration given to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  the relative costs associated with each ms drg  and changes in labor data by geographic area 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same ms drg 
to qualify for a cost outlier payment  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the ms drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
a medicare administrative contractor mac formerly known as a medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospital s most recently filed cost report 
generally  if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the ms drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all pps hospitals to be not less than or more than of total ms drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of ms drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments 

table of contents disproportionate share hospital payments in addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries  medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients 
disproportionate share hospital dsh payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by cms and are calculated as a percentage add on to the ms drg payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for dsh payments 
the primary method for a hospital to qualify for dsh payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a dsh percentage that is applied to payments based on ms drgs 
the hospital specific dsh percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the traditional medicare plan part a and supplemental security income ssi percentage  and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for medicaid but not medicare part a 
hospitals receive interim dsh payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report 
cms develops and distributes the hospital specific ssi percentages  typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year ffy  however  the release of the ssi percentages has been delayed in recent years as cms continues to examine and refine the data 
historically  the ssi percentage included only patient days paid under part a 
however  the ffy ssi percentages cms released in june reflect a policy change to include the medicare advantage part c days in the ratio 
the ssi percentages will be used to settle our cost reports 
as a result  during the three months ended june   we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of million as our initial estimate of the impact of using the ffy ssi ratios 
during the three months ended september   we learned that cms had instructed the macs to suspend the settlement of all cost reports including ours in which the ssi percentages would be used 
however  the macs are authorized to use the ssi percentages for current dsh interim payments and tentative settlements for post cost reporting periods pending the release of revised ssi percentages and the and subsequent ssi percentages 
the cost report settlement suspension is still in effect  and we cannot predict with certainty when the suspension will be removed 
during the three months ended june   cms released additional data regarding the ffy ssi percentages specifically  the part c days included in the ffy ssi ratios released in june in addition  cms issued a notice to hospitals indicating that  based on the agency s review of the data  it appeared that a significant number of non teaching hospitals nationwide had not submitted part c claims for ffys and to the medicare part a contractor 
part c claims are submitted to the medicare advantage payer for payment  however  cms requires hospitals to submit a no pay or shadow bill to the medicare part a contractor 
the notice instructed all non teaching hospitals to submit the part c no pay claims for ffys and to the medicare part a contractor by august   and submit an attestation of compliance with the requirement by september  we submitted the part c no pay claims and attestations of compliance by the respective deadlines 
cms has not yet released the ffys and ssi ratios and  according to the cms website  revised ffys and ssi ratios that will include the part c data will not be released until later in ffy despite a recent federal court decision that invalidates the inclusion of the part c days in the ssi ratios  cms has not indicated it intends to change its policy in this regard 
as a result  in the three months ended june   we revised our estimate of the impact of using the ffy ssi ratios for the calculation of medicare dsh payments for our non teaching hospitals for and subsequent periods to reflect the inclusion of the estimated part c days in the ffy ssi ratios  and we recorded an unfavorable adjustment to medicare net revenue of million million related to prior years and million related to the year ended december  
we intend to continue to pursue a reversal of cms policy in this regard through the administrative and judicial appeal process  however  we cannot predict the outcome or timing of the appeals 
the medicare dsh statutes and regulations have been the subject of various administrative appeals and lawsuits  and our hospitals have been included in these appeals for several years 
these types of appeals generally take several years to resolve  in particular for multi hospital organizations  because of cms administrative appeal rules 
the appeals have been further delayed due to cms general moratorium on the release of information critical to certain elements of these appeals 
although a recent federal court decision regarding a dsh appeal brought by another plaintiff was favorable  we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the dsh appeals for our hospitals 
a favorable outcome of our appeals could have a material impact on our future revenues and cash flows 
direct graduate and indirect medical education the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte limits established in  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education dgme and indirect medical education payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into medicare graduate medical education affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements 
we were previously contacted by cms in connection with dgme fte limits and related reimbursement at doctors medical center in modesto  california as a result of our transaction with a county owned hospital in modesto and the ime and dgme residency program sponsored by the county 
we replied to cms that  based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable cms rules  we believe that the dgme fte limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospital s cost reports were substantially correct 
in january  cms preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis 
during the three months ended september   we received notices from our mac of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter 
we have since received settlement notices for the hospital s through cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospital s ime and dgme payments  and the hospital s and cost reports were filed 
table of contents consistent with the mac s disallowance on the prior year cost reports 
additionally  the mac ceased making ime and dgme interim payments to the hospital from june until july  when a newly accredited program as described below became eligible for reimbursement 
although we have formally challenged cms decision to disallow the ime and dgme funding for prior periods  it could take several years to resolve this issue and the outcome is uncertain at this time 
as a result  in the three months ended june   we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of million million related to and prior years and million related to the year ended december   and we did not record any ime or dgme revenue for this hospital through june  cms recently revised certain of its policies regarding the eligibility of teaching programs for medicare ime and dgme reimbursement 
in january  the program sponsored by the county  doctors medical center and other hospitals obtained accreditation and other approvals effective for the academic year beginning july  for a new residency program that we believe will satisfy cms requirements for reimbursement 
on september   our mac approved interim payment rates for dgme and ime reimbursement to doctors medical center retroactive to july  hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 
inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 
payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups 
to be paid under the irf pps  each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the medicare regulations governing irfs 
as of december   all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required threshold 
cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
for filed cost reports  we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
typically  the macs settle cost reports within two years after the end of the cost reporting period  however  due to the aforementioned cms suspension of issuing cost report settlements nationwide  our medicare cost reports for periods ended on or after december  have not yet been settled 
we cannot predict when cms will remove the settlement suspension 
medicaid medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated payments under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care medicaid programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also receive dsh payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenues attributable to dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments were approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets  and the medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a state s budget  states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
the current economic downturn has increased the budgeting pressures on most states  and these budgeting pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending for medicaid programs in many states 
most states began a new fiscal year on july  and  although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets  some states are facing mid year budget gaps 
mid year budget gaps  increased medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn  limits on the ability of states to reduce medicaid eligibility criteria enacted as part of affordable care act and other factors could result in future reductions to medicaid payments or additional taxes on hospitals 
some states are considering proposals that would result in such reductions 
as an alternative means of funding provider payments  several states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting broad based provider taxes to fund the non federal share of medicaid programs 
some states  such as california  as described below  have introduced provider fee arrangements  which enhance rather than reduce funding available to providers 
because we cannot predict what actions the federal government or the states may take under existing legislation and future legislation to address budget gaps or deficits  or implement provider tax or fee arrangements  we are unable to assess the effect that any such legislation might have on our business  but the impact on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be material 
medicaid related patient revenues recognized by our continuing general hospitals in each state for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below years ended december  medicaid managed medicaid medicaid managed medicaid medicaid managed medicaid florida california georgia missouri texas south carolina pennsylvania alabama north carolina nebraska tennessee in october  the governor of california signed legislation supported by the hospital industry to impose a provider fee on general acute care hospitals that  combined with federal matching funds  would be used to provide supplemental medi cal payments to hospitals  as well as provide the state with million annually for children s health care coverage 
the hospital fee program created by this legislation was enacted to provide these payments for up to months retroactive to april and expiring on december  the state submitted the plan to cms for a required review and approval  and on october   cms approved the fee for service portion of the program 
on january   cms issued the final required federal approval of the program 
based on the most recent modeling prepared by the california hospital association cha  the program will result in additional revenue for our hospitals  net of provider fees and other expenses  of approximately million 
we will recognize the million during the three months ending march  because cms did not issue the final required federal approval of the program until january  the final net revenue we receive is subject to receipts from managed care plans  which are due during the three months ending march   and collection of of the fees due from california hospitals  substantially all of which were collected as of december   however  we do not expect the final net revenue that we will recognize in connection with the program to materially differ from our estimates 
during the three months ended december   we made periodic installment 
table of contents payments totaling million of our required payments of million under the program 
also during the three months ended december   we received million in fee for service supplemental proceeds of the aggregate million fee for service and managed care proceeds that we expect to collect 
we anticipate making the remaining million of our required payments and receiving approximately million in additional supplemental proceeds during the three months ending march  the net million of supplemental proceeds received in excess of fees paid during the three months ended december  is considered deferred income and classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  additional legislation to extend the california hospital fee program to coincide with the extension of the increased federal medicaid assistance percentage through june  will be required and is currently under development 
based on the most recent cha model  the extension of the fee program for the six months ending june  could result in approximately million of net revenues for our california hospitals in we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate  the approval of the six month program by cms or the passage of the legislation to extend the fee program 

table of contents regulatory and legislative changes recent regulatory and legislative updates to the medicare and medicaid payment systems are provided below 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient prospective payment system under medicare law  cms is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system 
these updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year 
on july   cms issued the changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for acute care hospitals and fiscal year rates final rule 
the final rule includes the following payment and policy changes effective for discharges on or after october  a net market basket increase of  which includes a full market basket increase of minus the reduction required by the affordable care act for ms drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data  hospitals that successfully report quality measures included in the hospital inpatient quality reporting hiqr program will receive the update for  hospitals that do not participate in the quality reporting program will receive an update of  a net increase of for ms drg capital payments  which includes a capital update increase of minus the reduction as called for by the affordable care act for ms drg capital payments  an additional reduction of to the operating and capital rate updates to recoup of the estimated overpayments in ffys and due to hospital coding and documentation processes in connection with the transition to ms drgs  
table of contents a decrease in the cost outlier threshold from  to  and the addition of new quality measures to the hiqr program and the retirement of one measure of the new measures will be considered in determining a hospital s ffy update  the remaining two measures to be reported in will be considered in a hospital s ffy update 
cms projects that the combined effect of all changes included in the final rule will result in an average decrease in payments to hospitals located in large urban areas populations over one million 
using a reduction as applied to our ipps payments for the months ended september   the estimated impact of the payment changes in the final rule is a decrease in our annual medicare inpatient net revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of factors that may influence our ipps payments by individual hospital  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate

table of contents affordable care act as enacted  the affordable care act will change how health care services are covered  delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals  reduced growth and other reductions in medicare program spending  and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration 
in addition  the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance  expands existing efforts to tie medicare and medicaid payments to performance and quality  and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the affordable care act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
in addition  a disproportionately large percentage of the new medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements 
two such states are florida and texas  where nearly half of our licensed beds are currently located 
on the other hand  the affordable care act provides for significant reductions in medicare market basket updates and reductions in medicare and medicaid dsh payments 
given that approximately of our revenues in were from medicare and medicaid  reductions to these programs may significantly impact us and could offset any positive effects of the affordable care act 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity and the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the law 
furthermore  many of the provisions of the affordable care act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until or later 
in addition  the affordable care act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates  such as the requirement to establish health insurance exchanges and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities  and we are unable to predict the timing and impact of such changes at this time 
it is also possible that implementation of the affordable care act could be delayed or even blocked due to court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law 
because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increases in volumes and revenues and decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  the reductions in medicare spending  the reductions in medicare and medicaid dsh funding  and numerous other provisions in the affordable care act legislation that may affect us 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of the american recovery and reinvestment act was enacted by congress and signed into law by the president in february to stimulate the us economy 
the law created federal tax incentives  expanded unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and increased domestic spending on education  infrastructure and health care  including billion in new spending on health information technology  most of which is for incentive medicare and medicaid payments to physicians and hospitals 
arra requires that hospitals and physicians become meaningful users of electronic health records ehrs and submit quality data as a condition of receiving the incentive payments beginning in on july   cms issued two final rules related to the adoption and dissemination of ehrs 
one of the rules defines the meaningful use requirements that hospitals and other providers must meet to qualify for federal incentive payments for adopting ehrs under arra 
the meaningful use final rule includes the following provisions a requirement that hospitals meet core objectives and select five objectives from a menu of optional objectives for demonstrating that they are meaningful users of ehrs  the remaining five optional objectives may be deferred until year two cms original proposal required hospitals to meet objectives  a requirement that hospitals meet clinical quality measures  instead of as originally proposed  a postponement of the administrative simplification objectives for electronic claims submission and eligibility checks  and a limitation on the ability of states to tailor the federal meaningful use definition only as it pertains specifically to public health objectives and data registries 
the other final rule released on july  describes the technical capabilities required for certified ehr technology 
hospitals and other providers must adopt certified ehr technology  as well as demonstrate meaningful use to qualify for the federal incentive payments 
if we are able to achieve full compliance at all of our hospitals by  we could receive approximately million in total estimated combined medicare and medicaid hospital incentive payments 
however  based on the timeframe we anticipate it will take for us to achieve full compliance with the hit requirements  it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the maximum amount of incentive payments of million 
we will be required to make investments in hit through of approximately million million of which has already been invested compared to approximately million of medicare and medicaid incentive payments that we will likely be able to begin recognizing no later than based on our anticipated 
table of contents hit implementation timeframe 
the medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals would be made over a four year  front weighted transition period 
the medicaid incentive payments  although federally funded  will be administered by the states and are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards 
hospitals that achieve compliance between and will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period 
we anticipate that  in addition to the expenditures we will incur to qualify for these incentive payments  our operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments 
much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements  but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of arra 
however  we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these hit enhancements that are not included in the above amounts 
hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of ehrs or fail to submit quality data by will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to medicare payments 
this reduction  which will be based on the market basket update  will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance 
using an estimated market basket of and our annual medicare inpatient net revenues for the year ended december   should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of ehrs and fail to submit quality data  the penalties would result in reductions to our annual medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately million  million and million in   and and subsequent years  respectively 
we are currently evaluating what changes will be required to our information systems  the cost of those changes  and the time and resources required in order for our hospitals to become meaningful users of hit 
the complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum hit funding permitted under arra 
because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of hit  including cms future implementation regulations  the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates 
medicare payments to physicians in the final rule updating the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs for cy  cms adopted an update of negative that was scheduled to take effect on january  mpfs rates are updated annually based on a formula that includes the sustainable growth rate sgr formula 
the sgr formula has resulted in negative updates since  however  cms has taken action or congress has enacted legislation each year to avoid the negative updates 
on december   the president signed the department of defense appropriations act  into law 
among other things  that act delayed the scheduled medicare payment reduction for physician services until march  additional legislation extended the zero percent update to the mpfs through may  subsequent legislation provided for a update to the mpfs effective for dates of service june  through december  on december   the president signed the medicare and medicaid extenders act of  which delayed a reduction in physician payments that was originally scheduled to take effect on january  and extended the update to the mpfs for one year 
we cannot predict what future actions  if any  congress or cms may take with respect to the mpfs update 
ffy budget proposal the president released his ffy budget proposal on february  the key provisions of the budget proposal affecting medicare and medicaid include funding to continue payments under the mpfs at current levels and offset the costs for the next two years with specific health savings  the termination of funding for the children s hospital graduate medical education payment program  provisions relating to the recovery of erroneous payments made to insurers participating in medicare advantage  and reductions to the medicaid provider tax threshold over a three year period beginning in  which would limit state financing practices that increase federal medicaid spending 

table of contents legislation to approve these proposals must be enacted by congress for them to become effective 
we cannot predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to such legislation or the impact the legislation might have on our revenues  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare and medicaid recovery audit contractor rac initiatives section of the tax relief and health care act of authorized a permanent program involving the use of third party recovery audit contractors racs to identify medicare overpayments and underpayments made to providers 
racs are compensated based on the amount of both overpayments and underpayments they identify by reviewing claims submitted to medicare for correct coding and medical necessity 
cms must approve new issues prior to widespread review by the racs 
we have established protocols to respond to rac requests and payment denials 
payment recoveries resulting from rac reviews are appealable through administrative and judicial processes  and we intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate 
in addition to overpayments that are not reversed on appeal  we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials 
we expect that the racs will continue to seek cms approval to review additional issues 
the affordable care act expanded the rac program s scope by requiring all states to enter into contracts with racs by december  to audit payments to medicaid providers 
cms issued a letter to state medicaid directors on october  that provided preliminary guidance to states on the implementation of medicaid rac programs  created a deadline of december  for states to establish rac programs  and established a deadline of april  for states to fully implement their rac programs 
on february   cms issued a notice temporarily suspending the requirement that states implement their rac programs until the final medicaid rac rule is issued 
we cannot predict with certainty the impact of the medicare and medicaid rac program on our future results of operations or cash flows 
medpac recommendations the medicare payment advisory commission medpac is an independent congressional agency established by the balanced budget act of to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program 
the medpac s statutory mandate is quite broad  in addition to advising congress on payments to private health plans participating in medicare advantage and providers in the original medicare plan  medpac is also tasked with analyzing access to care  quality of care and other issues affecting medicare 
on january   the medpac commissioners voted on final recommendations for their report to congress 
among other things  medpac s report recommends that hospital inpatient and outpatient services in be increased by 
the increase assumes a market basket increase of and a partial phase in of the permanent reduction in the hospital base payment that medpac believes is necessary to account for higher payments resulting from documentation and coding improvements under ms drgs 
the current law requires a market basket reduction and productivity adjustment that the medpac recommendations do not reflect 
further  medpac s report recommends that congress direct cms to recover all overpayments due to ms drg coding improvements 
current law limits such recoveries to those that cms found in ffys and medicare value based purchasing section of the affordable care act requires the secretary of hhs to establish a value based purchasing vbp program for hospital payments beginning in ffy based on hospital performance in on measures that are part of the hospital inpatient quality reporting program 
the vbp program is intended to be budget neutral  with of ipps payments allocated to the program in ffy  and increasing over time to in ffy and beyond 
on january   cms issued a proposed rule for the vbp program  pursuant to which hospital performance on each quality measure would be evaluated based on the higher of an achievement score in the performance period or an improvement score  which is determined by comparing the hospital s score in the performance period with its score during a baseline period of performance 
for ffy  cms proposes a nine month performance period from july  to march   with hospitals being notified of the estimated amount of vbp incentive payments for ffy approximately days prior to october  
table of contents although we believe that our commitment to quality initiatives described in this report will position our hospitals to benefit under the vbp program  we cannot predict with certainty the impact of the vbp program on our results of operations or cash flows 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement or none at all to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments  co insurance or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
at both december  and  approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
based on reserves as of december   a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by approximately million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance 
table of contents estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms  as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in future years 
it is not clear what impact  if any  the increased obligations on managed care and other payers imposed by the affordable care act will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases 
in the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to a number of policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  and who do not have some form of private insurance and  therefore  are responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe that our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including increased unemployment rates  reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems 
at both december  and december   approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance 
we provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our conifer subsidiary  which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts  as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance  that we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact with uninsured patients compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients  which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
a significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts 
under the compact  the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance  which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded 
the uninsured patient accounts  net of contractual allowances recorded  are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process 
on july   president obama signed into law the restoring american financial stability act of the dodd frank act 
among other things  the dodd frank act establishes a new consumer financial protection agency cfpa within the federal reserve and authorizes the cfpa to promulgate regulations to promote transparency  simplicity  fairness  accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services  including debt collection services 
the legislation gives significant discretion to the cfpa in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent to which the operations of our conifer subsidiary could be affected by these developments 

table of contents the estimated costs based on selected operating expenses  which include salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts 
most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospital s eligibility for medicaid dsh payments 
the estimated costs based on the selected operating expenses described above of caring for charity care patients for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our method of measuring the estimated costs uses adjusted self pay charity patient days multiplied by selected operating expenses per adjusted patient day 
the adjusted self pay charity patient days represents actual self pay charity patient days adjusted to include self pay charity outpatient services by multiplying actual self pay charity patient days by the sum of gross self pay charity inpatient revenues and gross self pay charity outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross self pay charity inpatient revenues 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the affordable care act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
however  because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us 
in addition  even after implementation of the affordable care act  we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program

revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased  which included a increase in net patient revenues  compared to the year ended december  increases in pricing  including the provision of higher acuity services and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix  were the largest contributing factors  resulting in a increase in net patient revenues  while declines in our inpatient admissions and outpatient visits resulted in a decrease in net patient revenues 
our net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  there were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
key positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  and the provision of higher acuity services  including a increase in acuity for commercial managed care inpatients 

table of contents key negative factors include an unfavorable shift in our total payer mix  including a decline in commercial managed care admissions  an million unfavorable patient revenue adjustment in the year ended december  related to the portion of our bad debts that will not be reimbursed by medicare  and an unfavorable patient revenue adjustment of approximately million million related to prior years and million related to the year ended december  recorded in the three months ended june  for the estimated impact on our dsh payments as a result of estimated lower ssi percentages at certain of our hospitals compared to million in the year ended december  patient days and total admissions decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  by and  respectively 
our patient volumes in the year ended december  were partially adversely impacted by a decline in flu related volumes  as well as weather related disruptions 
we believe the following factors also contributed to the overall decline in our inpatient volume levels loss of patients to competing health care providers  strategic reduction of services related to our targeted growth initiative  which seeks to de emphasize or eliminate less profitable service lines  and the current weak economic conditions  which we believe have adversely impacted the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals 
net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   despite a decline in total outpatient visits 
the primary reasons for the increase in outpatient revenues are improved terms of our managed care contracts and the provision of higher acuity services 
outpatient revenues were also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of various outpatient centers during the growth in outpatient revenue per visit of was constrained by an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix  including a decline in managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees  the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage  increased health benefits costs  an increase in the number of employed physicians  increased severance costs and higher state unemployment taxes  partially offset by decreased accruals for annual incentive compensation  reduced contract labor expense and discretionary contribution expense of million in the period for contributions to the k plan accounts of employees who were not eligible for annual incentive compensation 
contract labor expense  which is included in salaries  wages and benefits  was million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to the same period in salaries  wages and benefits expense for the year ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by various labor unions 
to date  labor unions represent registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our general hospitals  the majority of which are in california 
we are in the process of renegotiating the collective bargaining agreements for nearly all of these facilities 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from renegotiated agreements 
furthermore  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the renegotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
in addition  under the current terms of our peace accords with two labor unions  up to of our general hospitals may be subject to union organizing activities in supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by in the year ended december  compared to the same period in supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the increased utilization of high cost implants and pharmaceuticals  partially offset by decreases in the cost of pacemakers due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels 
a portion of the increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers 

table of contents we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  bulk purchases  contract compliance  improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedics and implants  and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of broadlane  inc  a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts is primarily due to a basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts  a million increase in uninsured revenues and higher pricing 
these items were partially offset by million of favorable adjustments for medicare bad debts that we will claim on our medicare cost reports and improved managed care accounts receivable balances by aging category 
our self pay collection rate  which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable  declined to approximately as of december  from as of december  the table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at december  and december  december  accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net medicare medicaid net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances managed care self pay uninsured self pay balance after insurance estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary other payers total continuing operations total discontinued operations a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past several years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
at december   our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary 
during and  we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows at march   at june   at september   at december   at march   at june   and at september  these self pay collection rates include payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance  prior to an account being classified and assigned to our collection agency subsidiary 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at december   a hypothetical decline in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
we provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our conifer subsidiary  which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts  as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance  that we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 

table of contents payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts 
we typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately at december  and at december   which includes collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary 
we continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow 
one specific initiative is our center for patient access services cpas  which is a centralized  dedicated operation that performs financial clearance  including completing insurance eligibility checks  documenting verification of benefits  providing required notifications to managed care payers  obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling 
although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days  and accounts receivable by aging category 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations were days at both december  and  within our target of less than days 
ar days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our collection agency subsidiary 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from our medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under our mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in our mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as medicaid 

table of contents the following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our mep  still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and  by aging category december  days days days over days total includes accounts receivable of million and million at december  and  respectively  that are fully reserved 
other operating expenses  net other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by approximately in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage  increases in the costs of repairs  maintenance and technology service contracts million  a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations million  increased costs of contracted services million  increased physician relocation costs million  increased systems implementation costs million  and increased hospital provider fees assessed by the states in which we operate million  which were substantially offset by additional medicaid supplemental payments recognized in revenues 
also partially offsetting these increases was a million  or  decline in malpractice expense to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decline in malpractice expense is principally due to a decrease in the average cost per claim and a decrease in the number of expected claims 
there was minimal impact to expense from a two basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities  compared to million of similar expense in the year ended december  the amount of malpractice expense in the year ended december  may not necessarily be indicative of malpractice expense amounts in future years due to changes in loss experience and interest rates used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities 
declines in rent expense million and a favorable adjustment of million relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to april on behalf of medical residents  which was recorded in the three months ended december   also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
we recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment 
material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital  consistent with our prior estimates during and when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets  this hospital is at risk of future impairments  particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospital s fair value or if the fair value of the hospital s real estate or equipment continues to decline 
the aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was million as of december  in addition  we recorded a million net impairment charge in connection with the sale of nine medical office buildings in florida and million in employee severance and other related costs 
these charges were partially offset by a million credit related to the collection of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals  which had been fully reserved in a prior year 
during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
we recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates 
material adverse 
table of contents trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time  consistent with our prior estimates during when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
we also recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the campus of one hospital that was scheduled to move to a new  replacement campus during our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the former campus for several months during and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings of the campus 
we compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and  because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
the remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  include million of employee severance and other related costs  a million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy  and a million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer had value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property 
our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results in our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospital s most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the costs primarily relate to costs to defend the company in various matters and changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as costs associated with the unsolicited acquisition proposal we received in november the costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the company in a matter to which the company was not a party and costs to defend the company in various matters 
interest expense during the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense primarily relates to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during and gain loss from early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due that we repurchased during the period  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts  issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes 
in addition  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for total cash of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  primarily related to the estimated fair values of new notes issued in note exchanges at less than their par values  net of the write off of unamortized note discounts  issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes tendered  as well as other notes repurchased

income tax benefit during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to million during the year ended december  the benefit recorded in the period is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the net decrease in the valuation allowance during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the estimated realization of deferred tax assets resulting from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against projected future years taxable income 
during the year ended december   after considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  we concluded that the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be reduced by approximately billion

impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
we recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates 
material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time  consistent with our prior estimates during when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets

standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is primarily dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers

table of contents as part of our long term objective to manage our capital structure  we may from time to time seek to retire  purchase  redeem or refinance some of our outstanding debt or equity securities subject to prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
these actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage and capital structure over time  which is dependent on our total amount of debt  our cash and our operating results 
at december   using the last months of adjusted ebitda  our ratio of total long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalent balances  to adjusted ebitda was x 
we anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors 
we intend to manage this ratio by following our business plan  managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure  including  if appropriate  the issuance of equity or convertible securities 
our ability to achieve our leverage and capital structure objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  many of which are described in part i  item a  risk factors  of this report 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements including those required to achieve compliance with the health information technology requirements under arra  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new buildings  and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  which include million  million and million  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the year ending december  will total approximately million to million  including million that was accrued as a liability at december  our anticipated capital expenditures include approximately million to meet seismic requirements for our california facilities 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million of which approximately million was spent prior to january  to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations compared to our estimate as of december  of approximately million 
our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new seismic evaluation tool 
there may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the state of california completes its review of our other hospitals 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending december  also include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit 
we expect to spend approximately million more on such improvements over the next five years 
during the year ended december   we acquired various outpatient centers in california  florida  missouri  new mexico  south carolina  tennessee and texas for an aggregate purchase price of million  which we funded with cash on hand 
these acquisitions were made in furtherance of our efforts to expand our outpatient services and increase our outpatient revenues 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest payments were higher in the period as compared to the and periods primarily due to million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended december  as a result of our exchange of approximately billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and our senior notes due for new senior secured notes  as well as other subsequent debt repurchases that reduced our outstanding debt 
in the year ended december   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates 
it had the effect of converting our 
senior notes due from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month libor plus a floating rate spread of approximately 
during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the senior notes  which substantially offset each other  were recorded in interest expense 
to mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month libor  we also entered into a separate agreement that limited the maximum one month libor to under the interest rate swap agreement 
we realized approximately million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  which we entered into in may and terminated in november depending on then existing market conditions  we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future 
income tax refunds  net of tax payments  were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to income tax payments  net of tax refunds  of approximately million during the year ended december  at december   our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion pretax expiring in to  approximately million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration  general business credit carryforwards of approximately million 
table of contents expiring in to and state nol carryforwards of billion expiring in to for which the associated deferred tax benefit  net of valuation allowance and federal tax impact  is million 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period 
these ownership changes include the offering of stock by us  the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders  as defined in the treasury regulations  or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock 
if such ownership changes by shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed percentage points during the three year period  then section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change 
in january  our board of directors adopted a section rights agreement as a measure intended to deter such ownership changes in order to preserve our nol carryforwards see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
periodic examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes 
the audit of our tax returns for the years ended december  and december  has been completed by the irs 
these returns include deductions for amounts paid in connection with our civil settlement with the federal government and upon which taxes had been paid by us in previous taxable years 
we filed tax refund claims to recover such previously paid taxes  and we received tax refunds of approximately million as of december  upon completion of the audit  we reached a settlement with the irs  which was approved by the congressional joint committee on taxation  in which we agreed to repay approximately million of the refunds previously received plus approximately million of interest 
sources and uses of cash our liquidity for the year ended december  was primarily derived from cash on hand 
we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients increase  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the and periods include the following increased income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  excluding net gain on sales of investments  investment earnings loss  gain loss from early extinguishment of debt  interest expense  litigation and investigation costs  impairment and restructuring charges  and depreciation and amortization in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   lower interest payments of million  primarily due to million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended december  as a result of our exchange of approximately billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and our senior notes due for new senior secured notes and other subsequent debt repurchases with the proceeds from our issuance of preferred stock and cash on hand that reduced our outstanding debt  as well as payments made as a result of our then existing interest rate swap agreement  which we terminated in november lower aggregate annual k matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of million million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   net income tax refunds of million received in the year ended december  compared to net income tax payments of million in the year ended december   lower payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of million  primarily due to million of payments in the year ended december  related to our settlement of wage and hour actions  million less cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations  principally due to accounts receivable collections in the prior year related to divested hospitals  reduced cash flows of million primarily due to the payment of additional accounts payable at december   other changes in working capital and changes in long term liabilities  including the following a million reduction in our professional and general liability reserves primarily due to improved claims experience and claim payments  
table of contents a million receivable recorded in for medicare bad debts that we have claimed or will claim on our medicare cost reports  a substantial portion of which is expected to be collected in  and a million receivable recorded in that we expect to collect in relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid by us prior to april on behalf of medical residents  and million we received in the year ended december  under our then existing interest rate swap agreement  which we terminated in november proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations during the year ended december  aggregated million  primarily from the sale of usc university hospital and usc kenneth norris jr 
cancer hospital 
we continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash 
these initiatives include the sale of excess land  buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets 
in october  we sold nine medical office buildings in florida for aggregate cash proceeds of million 
capital expenditures were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  including approximately million and million in the same respective periods for construction of a replacement hospital for our east cooper regional medical center in mount pleasant  south carolina 
we use fair market value to record our investments that are available for sale 
as shown in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
we have no investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic downturn that will materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants in october  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that  among other things  extended the term of our existing senior secured revolving credit facility amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement is scheduled to expire on october   however  this date could be accelerated to as early as the fourth quarter of if of our notes due in are not repaid  defeased or refinanced business days prior to their maturity 
the amended credit agreement provides  subject to borrowing availability  for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  with a million subfacility for standby letters of credit 
we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our amended credit agreement 
for additional information regarding the amended credit agreement  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our borrowing availability under the amended credit agreement was million based on our borrowing base calculation as of december  there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   and we had approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding 
in august  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes will mature on august  we will pay interest on the senior notes semi annually in arrears on february and august of each year  which payments commenced on february  the notes are general unsecured senior debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively subordinated to our senior secured notes  the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our amended credit agreement to the extent of the collateral 
also in august  we repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for approximately million  including approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase 
we repurchased the senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately million from our sale of new senior notes due and cash on hand 
in connection with these purchases  we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts  issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes 
in july  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our 
senior notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for total cash of approximately million  including less than million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase 
in connection with these purchases  we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs 

table of contents for additional information regarding our long term debt  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
we believe our existing debt agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings 
our cash on hand fluctuates day to day throughout the year based on the timing and levels of routine cash receipts and disbursements  including our book overdrafts  and required cash disbursements  such as interest and income tax payments 
these fluctuations have resulted in intra quarter net operating and investing cash uses of million to million and could cause us to use our senior secured revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity 
during  we could be required to pay the medicare program approximately million as a result of the ssi matter described under disproportionate share hospital payments above unless cms changes its policy regarding the inclusion of medicare advantage days in the calculation of the ssi ratio prior to its removal of the moratorium on cost report settlements 
we would be required to make the payments at the time of the cost report settlements pending the final outcome of our appeals related to this matter 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  availability under our revolving credit facility  anticipated future cash provided by operating activities  and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be adequate to meet our current cash needs 
these sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash requirements could be materially affected by the use of cash in acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of securities  and also by a deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections of this report  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancings  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured 
we do not rely on commercial paper or other short term financing arrangements nor do we enter into repurchase agreements or other short term financing arrangements not otherwise reported in our period end balance sheets 
we continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals  and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations  our consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and include million  million and million  respectively  of net operating revenues and million  million and million  respectively  of income from operations generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements 
in accordance with gaap  the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases 
the current terms of these leases expire between and  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
if these leases expire  we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of december  
table of contents recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues  including contractual allowances  provisions for doubtful accounts  accruals for general and professional liability risks  accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans  accruals for litigation losses  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed 
net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans  as well as certain uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
we have a system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
based on our reserves as of december   a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances would impact the estimated reserves by approximately million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes 
table of contents in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated  however  there are various exceptions that can occur 
such exceptions can include  for example  instances where we are unable to obtain verification because the patient s insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted  a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs  such as medicaid or victims of crime  and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied  and under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an month look back period  and other relevant factors 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance as of december   a hypothetical decline in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
there are various factors that can impact collection trends  such as changes in the economy  which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients  the volume of patients through the emergency department  the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance  and business practices related to collection efforts 
these factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process 
our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to our collection agency subsidiary between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned to our collection agency subsidiary by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our collection agency subsidiary 
managed care accounts are collected through our regional business offices  whereby the account balances remain in the related hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts collected through our regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years 

table of contents changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims  to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors  including the number of expected claims  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments  and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments 
we consider the number of expected claims  average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities 
our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known 
malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim 
based on our reserves and other information as of december   a increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
a increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value  a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves 
our discount rate was  and at december   and  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
the table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported and loss development reserves as of december   and december  case reserves incurred but not reported and loss development reserves total undiscounted reserves several actuarial methods  including the incurred  paid loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported and loss development reserves 
these methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  historical and current case reserves  reported and closed claim counts  and a variety of hospital census information 
based on these analyses  we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims  including the incurred but not reported and loss development reserve estimates 
the determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions 
malpractice claims generally take to years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment 
accordingly  the percentage of reserves as of both december  and representing unsettled claims is approximately 

table of contents the following table  which includes both our continuing and discontinued operations  presents the amount of our accruals for professional liability claims and the corresponding activity therein years ended december  accrual for professional liability claims  beginning of the year expense income related to current accident year prior accident years expense from discounting total incurred loss and loss expense paid claims and expenses related to current accident year prior accident years total paid claims and expenses accrual for professional liability claims  end of year total malpractice expense for continuing operations  including premiums for insured coverage  was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
our discount rate for was and for was 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a one hundred basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease net periodic pension expense for by million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  we calculate the amount of an impairment charge if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 

table of contents fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the following risks future financial results of our hospitals  which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients  terms of managed care payer arrangements  our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers  loss of volumes as a result of competition  and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs  which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses  changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to medicare and medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate  how the hospitals are operated in the future  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment 
material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital  consistent with our prior estimates during and when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets  this hospital is at risk of future impairments  particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospital s fair value or if the fair value of the hospital s real estate or equipment continues to decline 
the aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was million as of december  additionally  in our most recent impairment analysis as of december   we had two hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately million 
these two hospitals had the smallest excess of future undiscounted cash flows over carrying value 
changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the hospitals estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets  which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets  and if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets  impairment charges would occur and could be material 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by applicable accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 

table of contents our continuing operations are structured as follows our california region includes all of our hospitals in california and nebraska  our central region includes all of our hospitals in missouri  tennessee and texas  our florida region includes all of our hospitals in florida  our southern states region includes all of our hospitals in alabama  georgia  north carolina and south carolina  and our two hospitals in philadelphia  pennsylvania are part of a separate market 
these regions and market are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level 
future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
our goodwill balance is primarily related to our southern states region  which totals approximately million  and our central region  which totals approximately million 
in our latest impairment analysis as of december   the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  by approximately and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative profits losses in recent years  adjusted for certain nonrecurring items  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  and the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
prior to the year ended december   we had not included projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by our cumulative losses in recent years 
however  during the year ended december   our judgment about the need for a valuation allowance changed  and we concluded that the valuation allowance could be reduced to million 
as a result  the reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately billion was recorded as a benefit in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations 
our change in judgment resulted from our assessment that positive evidence outweighed negative evidence during thereby resulting in the inclusion of projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance 
the following factors were taken into account in our assessment cumulative profits for the three years ended december   projected profits for based on current business plans  carryforward periods for utilization of federal net operating loss carryovers  significant improvement in operating performance in and as evidenced by improved cost controls  successful renegotiation of managed care contracts on favorable terms  
table of contents successful quality control initiatives as reflected by improved clinical outcomes  successful execution of physician alignment strategies  and expansion of our outpatient business  and formulation of strategic initiatives to address uncertainties presented by the affordable care act and health information technology requirements under arra 
the remaining million balance in the valuation allowance as of december  is primarily attributable to certain state net operating loss carryovers and federal tax credits that  more likely than not  will expire unutilized 
we consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions  and such judgments are subject to periodic review 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected life  expected forfeiture rate  risk free interest rate range  early exercise threshold  and early exercise rate 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to unique events occurring during that time  which caused extreme volatility of our stock price 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 
the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it  in turn  is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns
