item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a  risk factors 
the following discussion takes into consideration our acquisition of mobile storage group  inc msg on june  the operations of msg are included in our operating results for only six months of the twelve months ended december  additionally  in  the results of operations include four other acquisitions beyond msg we completed during there were no acquisitions consummated in either or executive summary although fiscal was a challenging year for us globally with the prolonged weakened economy still impacting businesses and consumers  we were proactive on the cost side of our business and saw signs of positive growth in the last half of despite our total revenue declining approximately from the level  we continued to take essential actions to keep our business right sized  primarily by further reducing payroll costs where possible and by other effective cost management measures allowing us to maintain a strong adjusted ebitda margin of 
we were cash flow positive excluding the msg merger for the third consecutive year as we have continued to manage our operations and capital expenditures and have used this positive cash flow to pay down debt of approximately million since june  we began to see signs of recovery beginning in the second quarter and we also continued to enact selective price increases focusing on customers that had units out on rent for an extended period of time and to date  have observed no measurable difference in the attrition rates for these customers 
by the fourth quarter of  our level of business had finally ceased to decline on a year over year basis 
we continue to invest in our business with the adoption of a hybrid sales model incorporating a local as well as centralized component  with both groups incentivized on the basis of performance 
the salespeople at the branches primarily focus on construction customers who tend to be large multi unit customers that benefit from local service  while those in our nsc in tempe  arizona are targeting the balance of our customers who are generally single unit customers 
we also implemented a similar program in europe in in late  we restructured our manufacturing operations to reduce costs and implemented two rounds of company wide reductions in addition to other headcount reductions  which together resulted in cost savings that continued throughout we continue to monitor activity levels through a variety of metrics we use to determine the optimal efficiencies for our drivers  dispatchers  managers  salespeople and corporate staff needed in the changing business environment without negatively impacting customer service and sales activity levels 
in  we identified certain branch operations that we converted to operational yards  which operate at a significantly lower cost structure than traditional branches  and in  we opened three new greenfield locations as operational yards to redeploy fleet and increase revenue while maintaining that same level of efficiency 
we monitor the effectiveness of our branches and where possible  we will continue to migrate some of our branches to these lower cost operational yards in the future 
in august  we amended our revolving credit facility to reduce the line by million to million  which reduces our ongoing unused line fees 
this amendment also allows a permitted refinancing of our senior notes as well as restricted payments and acquisitions to occur without financial covenant restrictions provided we have million in pro forma excess borrowing availability 
following this amendment  in november we completed an offering of million principal amount of senior notes due and redeemed million principal amount of senior notes due we redeemed the balance of the senior notes due million in january our senior notes do not contain financial maintenance covenants and the financial maintenance covenants under our revolving credit facility are not applicable unless we fall below million in borrowing availability 

table of contents we believe these continued efforts  coupled with managing working capital and controls over capital expenditures will allow us to generate free cash flow in and to continue paying down debt  which remains a top management priority 
we have reduced borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility from million at december  to million at december   leaving us with million of unused borrowing capacity under our facility 
as we continue to seek alternative methods to reduce expenses we are at the same time focusing on sales growth to our core customers and continue our sophisticated sales campaign strategies at our nsc and branches 
we accomplish this in part through increasing salesperson accountability through our disciplined sales processes which we believe has traditionally given us a significant competitive advantage 
general we are the world s leading provider of portable storage solutions  through a total lease fleet of approximately  units at december  we offer a wide range of portable storage products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as our patented locking systems  multiple doors  electrical wiring and shelving 
we derive most of our revenues from leasing of portable storage containers  security offices and mobile offices 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally sell security and mobile office units 
we also sell non core assets  in particular van trailers and timber units  when the opportunity arises 
our sales revenues represented of total revenues in on june   we acquired the outstanding shares of msg and msg became a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini 
we refer to this transaction as the merger or the msg acquisition throughout this annual report 
the msg acquisition was the largest acquisition we have completed and it increased the scope of our operations in both the us and the us our consolidated statements of income for the periods reported include certain estimated expenses expected or incurred related to integration of the business acquired in the msg acquisition and restructuring charges related to restructuring of our manufacturing operations as a result of the msg acquisition 
prior to acquiring msg  we grew both organically and through smaller acquisitions  which we used to gain a presence in new markets 
traditionally  we enter new markets through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then implement our business model  which is usually more focused on customer service and marketing than the acquired business or other market competitors 
given our current utilization levels  we are currently entering new markets through greenfield locations by migrating idle fleet to new low cost operational yards 
these greenfield operational yards do not have all the overhead associated with a fully staffed branch as they typically only have drivers and yard personnel to handle deliveries and pick ups of our fleet 
a new location will generally have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new location  we are typically able to reach company average levels of profitability after several years 
the costs associated with opening a greenfield operational yard are lower than a fully staffed branch which should have a comparatively positive effect on margins 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing new infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum levels of staffing and delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we are able to generate relatively high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  any additional fixed expenses require us to achieve additional revenue in order to maintain our margins 
when we refer to our operating leverage in this discussion  we are describing the impact on margins once we either cover our fixed costs or if we incur additional fixed costs 
the level of non residential construction activity is an important external factor that we examine to determine the direction of our business 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our leased units at december  and december   respectively  and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  increases or decreases in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
beginning in the second quarter of  the level of our construction related 
table of contents business slowed down and then declined 
the decline continued and adversely affected our results of operations 
although the construction business has not returned to pre levels  the level of our construction related business began to stabilize and then increase in in managing our business  we focus on growing leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
our goals are to maintain a stable operating margin and  after the economy returns to normalized conditions  a steady growth rate in leasing revenues 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or extinguishment expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and it provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to exclude the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
for  and  adjusted ebitda excludes the integration  merger and restructuring expenses related to the msg acquisition  the reduction and restructuring of our manufacturing operations and other one time expenses 
in addition  excludes the impairment charge to goodwill 
in managing our business  we measure our ebitda margins from year to year based on the size of the branch 
we define this margin as ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new branch or operational yard  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new location  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new location will have lower ebitda margins in its early years until the branch increases the number of units it has on rent 
because this operating leverage creates higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent growth in leasing revenues  the ebitda margin at a branch will be expected to remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis if expenses remained the same or would decrease if fixed costs increased 
because ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures  as defined by the sec  we include in this annual report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these reconciliations are included in item  selected financial data 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and mobile offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  remanufacture and modify used iso containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment  stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 

table of contents our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data  which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we also have other non core products that are added to our fleet as a result of acquisitions that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
see item business product lives and durability 
during the last five fiscal years  our annual utilization levels averaged and ranged from a low of in to a high of in the average lease fleet utilization was and for and  respectively 
historically  our average utilization has been somewhat seasonal with the low normally being realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter of each year

table of contents twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease in leasing revenues resulted from a decrease in the average number of units on lease  partially offset by a increase in yield 
yield was primarily driven by higher trucking and ancillary revenues  while the average rental rate per unit remained virtually unchanged 
in  decline in both leasing and sales revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in business activity including non residential construction activity and the weakness in the global economy 
our leasing revenue decline in over the same period in the prior year was   and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  as the year over year decline in our business leveled off by the time the year ended 
our revenues from the sale of units decreased million  or  to million in from million in other revenues are primarily related to transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products and represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales relate to our sales revenue and as a percentage of sales revenue decreased slightly to in from in the gross profit margin on sales improved in over levels 
leasing  selling and general expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this slight increase as a percentage of revenues is due to our fixed costs in a declining revenue environment and was partially offset by variable cost saving reductions achieved by the cost cutting measures we implemented in response to the reduced revenue levels  primarily payroll related reductions and migrating a number of our branches to operational yards 
these operational yards do not have all the personnel and overhead expenses associated with a fully staffed branch 
the major decreases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were payroll and related payroll costs  which decreased by million primarily due to reductions in our workforce and the decrease in commission expense resulting from the lower revenues levels  insurance expense  which decreased million due to improved safety programs and general reductions in premiums  and advertising costs  which decreased million as we moved further away from printed advertising campaigns 
delivery and freight costs  including fuel  increased million  and were related to an increase in pick up and delivery activity of units by our drivers or third party vendors  many which were wood modular offices that command higher delivery rates than regular containers 
repairs and maintenance expenses  increased million  and includes the costs of repairing and maintaining our lease fleet as well as our delivery equipment  primarily our trucks  trailers and forklifts 
fixed costs for building and land leases for our locations  including real property taxes  increased million  primarily due to contractual rate increases  lease renewals  additional acreage  new greenfield locations  and property tax increases 
integration  merger and restructuring expenses for were million as compared to million in these costs primarily represent costs related to reductions in our workforce 
adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in and adjusted ebitda margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease is due to a decline in revenues  which were partially offset by our cost cutting measures 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the lower depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to reduced amortization expense of intangible assets  primarily due to customer relationships that are amortized on an accelerated basis  and reduced depreciation expense related to property plant and equipment  primarily due to lower levels of that equipment 
depreciation expense includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet  and the customized erp  crm and other software systems to enhance our reporting environment 
it also includes wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of customer relationships and trade name valuation that were associated with the merger 
since december   
table of contents our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation decreased million 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments within this item interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is attributable to a decrease in our lower average debt outstanding in compared to  principally due to the use of operating cash flow to reduce our debt over the past year 
our average annual debt outstanding decreased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
additionally  we redeemed million of our msg notes in the first quarter of and replaced million of the notes with notes in the fourth quarter of although we continue to reduce outstanding debt  the shift between our floating rate debt and our higher fixed interest rate debt has caused a slight increase in our weighted average interest rates as compared to the same period for the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding the amortizations of debt issuance and other costs 
taking into account the amortizations of debt issuance and other costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in debt restructuring expense in of million relates to the redemption of million of our msg notes and represents the early tender offer and related consent premiums and the write off of remaining unamortized acquisition date discount related to the notes redeemed 
see liquidity and capital resources senior notes 
deferred financing costs write off in of million represents that portion of deferred financing costs associated with the million company elected reduction in the abl agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility 
provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the uk corporate tax rate as well as the continued strengthening of our uk operations and their corresponding increased contribution to the consolidated net income 
our consolidated tax provision is based upon the expected tax rates for our operations in the us  canada  uk and the netherlands 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in the year was negatively affected by expenses of million million after tax  related to the redemption of the msg notes and the reduction in the abl agreement  both discussed above 
in addition  the year was negatively affected by expenses of million million after tax  related to integration  merger and restructuring 
the year was negatively affected by expenses of million million after tax  related to integration  merger and restructuring 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease in leasing revenues resulted from a decrease in the average number of units on lease  and a decrease in yield 
yield was primarily driven by lower ancillary revenues and the mix of the type of units on lease  while the average rental rate per unit remained virtually unchanged 
in  the decline in both leasing and sales revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in business activity level due to a continued decline in non residential construction activity and the economic recession 
our leasing revenues declined in the last two quarters of from the levels 
leasing revenues increased in the first two quarters of because the comparable quarters in excluded the msg merger 
our leasing revenue growth  or decline  rate in over the same period in the prior year was   and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
our revenues from the sale of units decreased million  or  to million in from million in 
table of contents other revenues are primarily related to transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products and represented of total revenues in both and cost of sales relate to our sales revenue and as a percentage of sales revenue decreased slightly to in from in  thus the gross profit margin on sales improved in over levels 
leasing  selling and general expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this slight increase as a percentage of revenues is due to a decline in leasing revenues  which were partially offset by the cost savings achieved in the million decrease in is the result of cost synergies achieved in the msg acquisition in addition to cost cutting measures on the reduced revenue levels 
these cost cutting measures primarily involved reductions in our workforce and migrating a number of our branches to operational yards 
these operational yards do not have all the personnel and overhead expenses associated with a fully staffed branch 
the major decreases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were delivery and freight costs  including fuel  which decreased million  and were related to the pick up and delivery of containers by our drivers or third party vendors  payroll and related payroll costs  which decreased by million primarily in connection with reductions in our workforce  and repairs and maintenance expenses  which decreased million  and which includes the costs of repairing and maintaining our lease fleet as well as our trucks  trailers and forklifts 
fixed costs for building and land leases for our locations  including real property taxes  increased million due to the assumption of leases utilized by the locations added in the merger and contractual rate increases at many of these locations 
integration  merger and restructuring expenses for were million as compared to million in in  these costs primarily represent costs related to reductions to our work force and the repositioning of fleet to their intended location 
in  these costs primarily represented estimated costs for exiting targeted mobile mini branch operations that overlapped with msg s properties  repositioning and relocating assets to their intended location and other costs associated with personnel and office expenses associated with the integration of the companies 
also included in the expense was our estimated cost for restructuring our manufacturing operations including severance  related benefit costs and asset impairment charges for the disposal of manufacturing equipment and inventories that were not used in the restructured environment 
goodwill impairment in represented a non cash charge for a portion of our goodwill related to our uk and the netherlands operations 
there was no goodwill impairment charges recorded in see notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report for a more detailed discussion 
ebitda increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in and ebitda margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
adjusted ebitda was million in as compared to million in and adjusted ebitda margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the depreciation of units acquired through prior years acquisitions 
it also includes wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
depreciation expense also includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet  and the customized erp  crm and other software systems to enhance our reporting environment 
depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of customer relationships and trade name valuation that were associated with the msg merger 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased only by million 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the million of debt we assumed in the merger 
although at the time of the merger  we assumed the msg notes and our interest rate spread under our revolving credit facility increased from libor to libor  our average borrowing rate declined slightly in  due to lower prevailing libor rates 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for

taking into account the amortizations of debt issuance and other costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for our effective tax rate was negatively affected by the goodwill impairment charge of million related to our european operations  which was not tax deductible 
our consolidated tax provision includes the expected tax rates for our operations in the us  canada  us and the netherlands 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet

liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years  our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to our cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings 
for the past three years  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding the merger 
during the past three years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded from our operating cash flow  and from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flow is generally weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units and as a result of seasonal weather in some of our markets 
during  and  we significantly reduced our capital expenditures and were able to fund capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we expect this trend to continue in in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our principal current source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility described below 
senior notes 
at december   we had three series of outstanding senior notes i million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  ii million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  and together with the notes  the mobile mini notes and iii million aggregate principal amount of senior notes originally issued in the amount of million by msg due the msg notes and together with the mobile mini notes  the senior notes 
in january  all of the remaining msg notes were redeemed and ceased to be outstanding 
we issued the notes on november  at an initial offering price of of their face value 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to redeem approximately million of the outstanding msg notes  to pay the redemption and tender offer premium approximately million and accrued interest approximately million on the msg notes  and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering 
we used the remaining net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the senior notes include covenants  indemnities and events of default that are customary for indentures of this type  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  sales of assets and payment of dividends 
management does not believe that the covenants in the senior notes limit our ability to pursue its intended 
table of contents business strategy or its future financing needs 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior notes as of december  revolving credit facility 
on june   we entered into a million abl credit agreement the credit agreement with deutsche bank ag new york branch and the other lenders party thereto 
in august  we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement that  among other things  allows a permitted refinancing of our senior notes and for restricted payments and acquisitions to occur without financial covenant restrictions  provided we have million in pro forma excess borrowing availability as defined in the credit agreement 
we also elected to reduce the credit agreement by million to million  which reduces our ongoing unused line fees 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due on june  the obligations of mobile mini and our subsidiary guarantors under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and million of additional borrowing availability under the credit agreement  based upon borrowing base calculations as of such date 
we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december  amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and repaid during the term may be reborrowed 
outstanding amounts under the credit agreement will bear interest  at our option  at either i libor plus a defined margin  or ii the agent bank s prime rate plus a margin 
the applicable margins for each type of loan will range from to for libor loans and to for base rate loans depending upon our debt ratio  as defined in the agreement  at the measurement date 
based on our debt ratio at december   our applicable interest rate margins for libor loans will be libor plus and prime plus for base rate loans until the next measurement date which is the end of each fiscal quarter and becomes effective the month following management s communication to their lenders 
the credit agreement provides for uk borrowings  denominated in either pounds sterling or euros  by the company s subsidiary mobile mini uk limited  based upon a uk borrowing base and additionally supported by the us and canada borrowing base  if necessary 
for us borrowings  which are denominated in us dollars  the borrowing base is based upon a us and canada borrowing base 
availability of borrowings under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible container fleet  eligible inventory including containers held for sale  work in process and raw materials  machinery and equipment and real property  each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit 
the credit agreement does contain certain financial maintenance covenants  but these maintenance covenants are not applicable unless we have less than million in borrowing availability under the facility 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries  including covenants that restrict their ability to  among other things  i make capital expenditures in excess of defined limits  ii allow certain liens to attach to us or our subsidiary assets  iii repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities  or prepay certain indebtedness  iv incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions  and v make acquisitions or other investments 
we believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next months 
if not  we have sufficient borrowings available under our revolving credit facility to meet any additional funding requirements 
we monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly available information 
based upon that information  we do not presently think that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders might not be able to honor its commitments under the credit agreement 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in as compared to million in and million in the million decrease in over in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income  after giving effect to non cash items and a decrease in working capital 
in  working capital was primarily affected by a decrease in accrued liabilities 
this decrease reflects the continued reduction in certain liabilities associated with the merger and the interest payment in connection with the million redemption of the msg notes 
in  there were decreases in 
table of contents receivables  inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these decreases were primarily due to the weakened economy  our restructured manufacturing operations and reduction of certain liabilities associated with the merger 
in  there were decreases in both inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses providing positive cash flows  which were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these decreases were primarily a result of the merger and the decrease in purchases of inventories due to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in late cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to million in and to net cash used of million in in and  we did not acquire any businesses  compared to cash payments for acquisitions of million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  provided net cash proceeds of million in compared to net cash proceeds of million in and net cash expenditures of million in our capital expenditures for our lease fleet decreased in compared to as we required fewer units to be manufactured or remanufactured from prior acquisitions due to the continued economic slowdown 
proceeds from sale of lease fleet units decreased as compared to additions to the lease fleet primarily included remanufacturing of prior acquisition units and manufactured steel offices 
during the past several years we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
at the end of  we restructured our manufacturing operations to right size our manufacturing requirements considering the large lease fleet we acquired in the msg transaction 
as a result of the acquisition and the current economic conditions  we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on remanufacturing units acquired in prior acquisitions to meet our lease fleet standards as these units are placed on rent 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for technology and communication improvements  delivery equipment and improvements to our branch locations 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
we have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information and communication systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in and million in in november  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  which we used to redeem million in principal amount of msg notes 
in conjunction with the redemption of the msg notes  we incurred approximately million in tender and consent premiums 
earlier in the year we also redeemed million of the msg notes 
in  we reduced our net borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million in addition to reducing other net debt obligations by million 
in  we reduced our net borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million and other net debt obligations of million in addition to redeeming million principal amount of msg notes

in connection with the merger we also assumed certain debt obligations  some requiring monthly installment payments 
we received million  million and million from the exercises of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 

table of contents hedging activities 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements in place to fix interest rates paid on a total of million of our outstanding debt 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are at a variable rate 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and million of senior notes  together with other  primarily unsecured notes payable obligations  and obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms typically ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and office related equipment 
at december   primarily in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately million in letters of credit 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
we enter into operating and capital lease obligations from time to time 
at december   we had million in capital lease obligations 
the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include certain real estate leases that expire in  but have lease renewal options that we currently anticipate to exercise in at the end of the initial lease period

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season 
these retailers usually return these leased units to us in december and early in the following year 
this seasonality has historically caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of each year 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage and mobile office units are recognized on a straight line basis 
delivery and hauling revenues and expenses from our portable storage and mobile office units are recognized when these services are earned 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with our customers 
share based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of our share based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we historically have not paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend rate 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the 
table of contents assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in the past we have issued stock options and restricted stock  which we also refer to as nonvested shares 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
in the share based compensation expense was reduced by million to reflect anticipated shortfalls related to share awards with vesting subject to a performance conditions 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
we operate in one reportable segment  which is comprised of three operating segments that also represent our reporting units north america  the uk and the netherlands 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these three reporting units 
at december   only north america and the uk have goodwill subject to impairment testing 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at december using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  we will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 

table of contents at december   we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures  tax payments and discount rate 
each approach was given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
as of december   neither of the reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values less than their individual net asset carrying values  therefore step two was not required at december  in step two of the impairment test  we are required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
we allocated the fair value of the reporting units to the respective assets and liabilities of each reporting unit as if the reporting units had been acquired in separate and individual business combinations and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting units 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we reconciled the fair values of our three reporting units in the aggregate to our market capitalization at december  the performance of our and annual impairment analyses resulted in no impairment charges to the north america or uk reporting units  where all of our goodwill is recorded 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in  primarily related to the uk reporting unit 
the fair value of the north america and uk reporting units exceeded the carrying value at december  by and  respectively 
at december   million of our goodwill relates to the north america reporting unit and million relates to the uk reporting unit 
the discount rates utilized in the analyses ranged from to while the terminal growth rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis were approximately 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
there were no indicators of impairment at december  and depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
van trailers and other non core products are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
in april  we evaluated our depreciation policy on our steel units and changed the estimated useful life to years from years and decreased the residual value to from 
this results in continual depreciation on steel units for five additional years at the same annual rate of of book value 
this change had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements at the date of the change in estimate 
we made this change because some of our steel units have been in our lease fleet longer than years and these units continue to be effective income producing assets that do not show signs of realizing the end of their useful life 
our historical lease fleet data on our steel units shows we have retained comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of the steel units in our lease fleet 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with 
table of contents the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share effective april prior to april insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable 
table of contents determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 
deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
at december   we have a million valuation allowance and million of deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management believes that certain state net operating loss carryforwards will expire unused and  as a result  has created a valuation allowance of million 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations and  or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
purchase accounting 
we account for acquisitions under the purchase method 
under the purchase method of accounting  the price paid by us  including the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock  if any  is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the convertible redeemable participating preferred stock issued at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired represents goodwill that is subject to annual impairment testing 
earnings per share 
basic net income per share is calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  net of shares subject to repurchase by us during the period 
income allocable to common stockholders is net income less the earnings allocable to preferred stockholders 
diluted net income per share is calculated under the if converted method unless the conversion of the preferred stock is anti dilutive to basic net income per share 
to the extent the inclusion of preferred stock is anti dilutive  we calculate diluted net income per share under the two class method 
potential common shares include restricted common stock and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of nonvested stock awards and upon conversion of convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock method 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements transfers of financial assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that changes the information a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about the transfer of financial assets and continuing interests held in transferred financial assets 
the standard amends previous accounting guidance by removing the concept of qualified special purpose entities 
this accounting standard became effective for the company for transfers occurring on or after january  we adopted this accounting standard and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
multiple element arrangements 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective for arrangements entered into after january  we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
fair value measurements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance which requires new disclosures of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
the guidance also requires disclosure about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for level and level we adopted the provisions of this guidance on january  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued clarification on the accounting guidance for business combinations 
the new accounting guidance clarifies the requirement that public entities that have entered into a new business combination during the year  present comparative financial statements disclosing revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this guidance is effective for business combinations entered into after january  we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
goodwill 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for goodwill impairment testing 
the new accounting guidance states that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the reporting unit should perform step of a goodwill impairment after considering the evidence of adverse qualitative factors that an impairment may exist 
this guidance is effective for business combinations entered into after january  we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on a notional amount of million of debt 
in  comprehensive income included million  net of income tax expense of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes

we currently have branch operations outside the us and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the uk are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non us operations are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us  at our option  to borrow funds locally in pound sterling denominated debt
