item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a canadian corporation  with principal assets and operations in the united states  whose primary business is developing  manufacturing and selling our nano lithium titanate battery cells  batteries and battery packs and providing related design  installation and test services 
our primary focus is marketing our large scale energy storage solutions to power companies and electric grid operators throughout the world 
in addition  we market our batteries to electric and hybrid electric bus manufacturers  and are working to expand into new industrial markets 
starting in we began looking at additional opportunities to expand the application of our battery technology into various industrial markets that have a need for the attributes of our battery technology 
we believe that in the aggregate  our target markets are multi billion dollar emerging markets with room for a number of successful suppliers 
at the present time  we perceive no dominant provider and we believe that as a result of our significant differentiated product attributes  the overall strength of our management team  and the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace  that we have a very good chance of becoming one of the successful suppliers 
our proprietary technology platform gives our products a number of unique  highly sought after attributes that clearly differentiate o ur products from their alternatives 
included in these attributes are substantially longer cycle and calendar lives  a rapid recharge time  the ability to provide instantaneous high power  a wide operating temperature range and increased operational safety 
has been a transition year as we have now completely exited the life sciences and performance materials markets to focus on selling products into the power and energy systems market 
we expect to be the year that we gain traction in the sale of our various battery products 
historically  we have provided contract research services on select projects where we can utilize our resources to develop intellectual property and or new products and technology 
although contract services revenue comprised a significant portion of our total revenues in recent years accounting for   and  respectively in  and  we expect this percentage to immediately diminish as we cease provided services under military contracts and as our battery sales expand 
our revenues have been generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations  and government contracts and grants 
we expect future revenues to consist primarily of product sales 
we currently have agreements in place to develop a suite of energy storage solutions for the stationary power market  provide battery modules to a us based bus manufacturer and are negotiating agreements to develop battery modules for various other industrial applications  supply a one megawatt alti ess energy storage system for a test of wind energy integration and supply our nano lithium titanate powder to an early stage chinese battery manufacturer affiliated with canon although deliveries under such agreement are suspended  we have also sold a battery system and battery cells unde r this agreement 
general outlook we have generated net losses in each fiscal year since incorporation 
revenues from product sales increased from  in to million in from our increasing battery module sales to proterra for their all electric and hybrid commercial buses 
commercial collaborations  contracts and grants increased million from million in to million in primarily as a result of our work with the office of naval research 
however  as a condition to closing the canon investment we have had to abandon all future military business 
we completed our contract with the us office of naval research and most of our nanosensor grant during our current focus is on the development of products in energy storage that we anticipate will eventually bring a substantial amount of higher margin revenues from product sales 
we expect our nano lithium titanate batteries and battery systems to be the source of such higher margin revenues 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following based on the success of the aes megawatt frequency regulation trial  as validated in the kema  inc analysis and report  we have experienced a substantial amount of interest in our large scale battery systems from other entities and are in active sales development discussions with a number of them 
on february   we accepted a million purchase order to supply the university of hawaii hawaii natural energy institute hnei a megawatt alti ess energy storage system for a test of wind energy integration 
we anticipate shipping this system to hnei during the third quarter of on february   we also signed a contract with inversiones energ ticas  sa de cv ine for the supply and installation of a ten megawatt alti ess advanced battery system in el salvador 
total revenues under the contract are million to be re cognized over an expected month period following altair s receipt of the notice to proceed  which is expected in the next days 
under the contract  we are responsible for virtually all of the design  supply  labor  installation and commission of the advanced battery system 
we will provide a one year warranty for the entire system and an additional two year warranty for the batteries and control system 
in june  we signed a contract with proterra  llc  a golden  colorado based leading designer and manufacturer of heavy duty drive systems  energy storage systems  vehicle control systems and transit buses to sell them battery modules for their all electric and hybrid electric buses 
proterra s systems are scalable to all forms of commercial buses and class trucks 
during we sold million of battery modules to proterra 
we anticipate battery module sales to significantly expand to proterra in and future years as they continue to scale up their business 
based on the demonstrated success of our battery in the proterra bus application  we have also entered into discussions with a number of other bus manufacturers or systems integrators regarding the purchase of our battery products for their respective applications 
we are in discussions with a number of industrial manufacturers of fork lifts  elevators and other electric equipment whose use requires the long life  rapid recharge  extreme operating temperature range or other differentiating attributes of our battery technology 
we signed a supply agreement with yte  an affiliate of canon  to provide them with metric tons of nano lithium titanate by the end of which agreement was suspended in february 
as specified in the share subscription agreement with canon  if such transaction closes  we will explore the establishment of an nano lithium titanate manufacturing plant in china to supply yte with over  metric tons of nano lithium titanate per year 
although it is not essential that all of these markets become successful for our battery technology in order to permit substantial long term revenue growth  we believe that full commercialization of several of our battery applications will be necessary in order to expand our revenues enough to create a likelihood of our becoming profitable in the long term 
we remain optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
our operating divisions since early we have been organized into two divisions the power and energy group and an all other division 
during  we operated as three separate divisions  including a performance materials division and a life sciences division in addition to the power and energy group 
based on the results of a comprehensive review of all our activities  strengths  weaknesses  competitive opportunities and the overall market that was conducted during  we determined to focus our future efforts exclusively in the power and energy arena 
as a result  we began in late and early to eliminate or sell our assets and efforts in the life sciences and performance materials divisions 
as of december   all new efforts in the life sciences area had been stopped and the intellec tual property rights associated with that division were assigned to spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc pursuant to an amendment to our existing license agreement 
during  the residual work done in the performance materials market to fulfill commitments with existing customers totaling million in revenue was completed  our interest in the alsher titania joint venture with sherwin williams was transferred to sherwin williams  and all other performance materials related work was stopped 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity as of december   we had cash totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities for compared to was due primarily to less inventory purchases million  a swing from a gain on sale of our spectrum stock in to a loss on the sale of our marketable securities in  primarily our auction rate securities million  and an increase in deferred revenues collected from proterra of  and yte of million 
investing activities for the year ended december  reflect the sale of our auction rate securities and spectrum stock totaling million in net cash proceeds 
additionally  we purchased property and equipment totaling  compared to property and equipment purchases of  made for the year ended december  our cash and short term investments decreased by million  from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to net cash used in operations of million the net source of cash from financing activities of  for the year ended december  primarily reflects the raise of  net of expenses from the at the market sale of common stock less our last payment on the note payable on our reno  nevada building of  plus interest 
we had a single note payable in the original principal amount of million secured by a first lien on our building 
the final payment of principal and interest was due on february  and paid on january  in september of we entered into the share subscription agreement the share subscription agreement with canon investment holdings limited canon under which they have agreed  subject to conditions to closing and the risk of termination  to purchase a number a number of common shares such that  following closing  canon will own of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis 
based upon the number of common shares and the rights to acquire common shares outstanding as of december   we estimate that the number of shares to be purchased will be  at an aggregate purchase price of 
if we issue additional common shares prior to closing  as permitted by recent amendment  the number of shares to be purchased  and the aggreg ate purchase price  will increase 
as a result of restrictive conditions associated with the canon negotiations and then contained in the share subscription agreement  we have been precluded from raising any additional external equity or debt capital since july of as a result of delays in filing of the joint request with the committee for foreign investment in the united states cfius to review the canon transaction and the decision by cfius to extend their initial day review into an additional day review  the transaction did not close in as we were anticipating closing in early february  canon indicated that it was not in a position to close 
the rights under the conditional supply and licensing agreement to purchase our nano lithium titanate  and manufacture batteries using our design principles  were significant motivations for canon to enter into the share purchase transaction  and canon indicated that its operating subsidiary was having difficulty implementing the battery manufacturing technology called for in our conditional supply and licensing agreement 
canon also indicated  although we have not verified  that it had permitted certain credit facilities required to close to expire near the original end date of the share subscription agreement and needed time to re establish such facilities 
on february   we signed the first amendment to share subscription agreement the ssa amendment which  among other things  extended the end date under the share subscription agreement to may  the ssa amendment also authorized us  subject to certain limitations  to sell equity securities in order to raise interim capital 
we have since engaged jmp securities with respect to a possible interim financing 
if we are unable to raise interim capital  we will face a liquidity shortage prior to the anticipate closing of the canon transaction in may assuming we raise interim capital and we close the pending canon equity investment in may  we believe we will have enough cash on hand to fund our operations through and to provide a portion of the capital needed to construct a china based nano lithium titanate manufacturing facility 
if such facility is constructed as anticipated by the share subscription agreement  we will likely need to either seek project financing or other capital specifically for the construction of the facility or use additional capital toward construction of the facility and seek additional capital for operations 
if the canon transaction does not close in may  as expected  we will need to promptly raise additional capital  through a strategic investor or from the equity markets  in order to fun d our operations 
we evaluate our capital needs and the availability of capital on an ongoing basis and  consistent with past practice  expect to seek capital when and on such terms as we deem appropriate based upon our assessment of our current liquidity  capital needs and the availability of capital 
given that we are not yet in a positive cash flow or earnings position  the options available to us are fewer than to a positive cash flow company 
specifically  we would not generally qualify for long term institutional debt financing 
other than the share subscription agreement  we do not have any commitments from any party to provide required capital and may or may not  be able to obtain such capital on reasonable terms 
consistent with past practice we expect to raise additional capital through the sale of common shares  convertible notes  stock options  and warrants 
we do not expect the current economic environment to preclude our ability to raise capital  but the overall cost to the company of doing so will most likely be high 
to the extent we expect shortages in capital and do not have significant order volume  purchases of raw materials would be discontinued and other measures to conserve cash would be implemented as necessary to extend cash availability 
other measures to preserve cash on hand as required would include the following reducing production levels  deferring discretionary expenditures such as capital purchases  internal research costs  training  and routine equipment and building maintenance  eliminating or deferring filling non critical positions through attrition  and reductions in workforce 
over the long term  we anticipate substantially increasing revenues by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales in the stationary power  electric bus and selected other industrial markets 
however  this increase in revenues will be dependent on our ability to transition our stationary power products from prototypes into commercial grade products 
during  we continued making significant expenditures for our battery initiative  with our existing staff and some new equipment for the manufacture of nano lithium titanate products and increased our sales and marketing efforts 
in  we intend to increase the level of spending on our battery initiatives continuing the enhancement of our products and their conversion into commercial grade products 
as we move into  we do not expect to build up our inventory for anticipated sales more than its current level 
because of the size of the ine contract we do expect our inventory of finished goods to be larger than our current inventory level 
with regard to inventory decisions  we also consider the lengthy manufacturing cycle of four to six months required to produce our large battery systems 
depending on the time lag between the initial inventory buildup and the actual sales  our cash balance will be negatively impacted 
since actual sales and production volumes for the full year of are unknown at this time  we are not able to currently estimate our anticipated inventory purchases through december  we expect that we will end  however  w ith an inventory level  excluding inventory specifically tied to identified customer sales  in the same range or lower than we ended liquidity will be a consideration in our final determination of production volumes 
our objective is to manage cash expenditures in a manner consistent with rapid product development that leads to the generation of revenues in the shortest possible time 
capital commitments and expenditures the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands of dollars less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable interest on notes payable contractual service agreements capital leases operating leases unfulfilled purchase orders total contractual obligations depending upon the speed of our revenue growth in  we plan to spend approximately million on production and tooling equipment associated with our power and energy group capacity expansion excluding the construction of a china based nano lithium titanate manufacturing plant 
this level of expenditures assumes that we will continue to rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our cells 
should we change this model and decide to manufacture the cells ourselves  a much higher level of capital investment would be required to build a cell manufacturing capability here in the us the size of this investment would be dependent upon the size of the facility required and to what extent we could use existing available space in our current locations 
in addition  assuming the canon transaction closes and based upon projected nano lithium titanate order volume  in or  we anticipate significant capital expenditures related to the construction of a nano lithium titanate manufacturing plant in china in accordance with the use of proceeds provisions of the share subscription agreement 
such plant is at the early stage of planning  and we cannot reasonably estimate the related capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet transactions during results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected  unaudited  condensed consolidated financial data for the periods indicated

revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  up from million for power and energy group revenue increased million from million in to million in this was due primarily to million of increased battery module sales to proterra and a million increase in revenue from our office of naval research onr contract  offset by  in non recurring revenues in with bae systems 
the onr contract was completed as of december  all other contracts and grants revenue increased million from  in to million in due to our us army nanosensor contract 
cost of goods sold cogs product cogs in the power and energy group increased from  in to million in primarily from increased battery module sales to proterra 
commercial collaborations cogs in the power and energy group dropped from  in to  in due primarily to the nonrecurring contract with bae systems during contract and grants cogs in the power and energy group increased from million in to million in related primarily to the million increase in revenue from our office of naval research contract 
all other contracts and grants cogs increased from  in to million in due to our us army nanosensor contract 
operating expenses total research and development expenses decreased million or from million in to million in power and energy group research and development expenses decreased million from million in to million in both trends were due to the transfer of more costs to cost of good sold that directly related to our office of naval research and us army nanosensor contracts 
total sales and marketing expenses increased million or from to as the result of our effort to enhance our sales penetration into our target markets of electricity generation and distribution and electric buses 
total general and administrative costs were down  or from to as the result of our focus on company wide cost controls 
loss on disposal of assets of  during resulted from the early retirement of various production and research and development related assets no longer used in our power and energy group 
other income and expense the million realized loss on investments during resulted primarily from the sale of our auction rate securities million 
net loss overall net loss of million in versus the overall net loss of million during was the result of our transitions in described above 
overall this transition consisted of eliminating our defense and performance materials businesses as we focused on growing our power and energy group business 
fiscal year vs 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for power and energy group revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for this decrease is attributable to our shift from lower margin contracts and grants revenues partially offset by higher product sales and commercial collaboration revenues  primarily with electric bus manufacturer proterra  llc 
contracts and grants revenue was down million from to this was due primarily to the completion of the onr i contract in november and the ramp up of the onr ii contract starting in june all other revenues for the year ended december  was million compared to million in this net decrease was primarily from million in reduced commercial collaboration revenue from several customers  netted with a  one time license fee revenue from spectrum pharmaceuticals in operating expenses power and energy group cost of goods sold increased million in the power and energy group from million in to million in the warranty and inventory reserves increased from a credit of million in to  in expense in the million credit in resulted from an agreement effective july with phoenix motor cars  whereby the purchase and supply agreement was terminated and the parties resolved all outstanding issues with respect to the warranty associated with the battery packs sold in the  expense in includes a  inventory valuation allowance primarily associated with the cell manufacture issue previously described 
total research and development expense decreased by million  or  from million in to million power and energy group research and development costs decreased million from million in to million in associated with the completion of grant work in research and development costs for all other operations decreased by million attributable to a shift in focus and realignment of resources from life sciences and performance materials to the battery production arena 
the corporate segment research and development expenses primarily reflect the personnel and operating costs associated with our science and technology group which supports the company s overall research and development efforts 
notes receivable extinguishment expense of million in relates to an agreement effective july with phoenix motorcars  whereby all accounts receivable and notes receivable relating to the purchase and supply agreement were cancelled 
settlement and release expense of million in resulted from a settlement agreement with al yousuf llc related to claims associated with their november investment in the company 
total sales and marketing remained relatively flat at million in compared to million in total general and administrative expenses decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease is related to the separation expenses related to our former president and chief executive officer that were incurred in february  and due to strict cost containment in this area of the business during other income and expense interest income decreased by  or  from to on average  a higher average level of cash during than in and lower interest rates in drove this reduction 
interest expense remained flat at approximately  for and realized gain loss on investments increased from an  loss in to an  gain in this  gain in arose primarily from the sale of  shares of spectrum common stock at a higher market price than recorded on our books when the stock was originally received as payment from spectrum for the achievement of certain contract milestones 
net loss the net loss for the year ended december  totaled million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  power and energy group net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million in this increased loss was due to a shift away from low margin contracts and grants revenue in and only partially offset by increased product sales and commercial collaborations revenues  and the million product warranty credit in the net loss of corporate for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million in this decrease is primarily related to a number of one time expenses reflected in the results including the costs associated with the al yousuf llc settlement  the phoenix notes receivable extinguishment and the separation expenses related to our former president and chief executive officer  netted with the alsher titania asset impairment as described above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management based the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to long lived assets  share based compensation  revenue recognition  overhead allocation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  and deferred income tax 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which f orm the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
changes to these judgments and estimates could adversely affect the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist principally of bank deposits and institutional money market funds 
short term investments that are highly liquid have insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of days or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents 
investments that do not meet the definition of cash equivalents are classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
our cash balances are maintained in bank accounts that are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and canada deposit insurance corporation cdic up to a maximum of us  and cn  respectively  per depositor 
at december  and december  we had million and million  respectively  in excess of insurance limits in bank accounts insured by the fdic or cdic 
investment in available for sale securities the investment in short term available for sale securities consisted of  shares of spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc common stock valued at  at december  this stock was received in exchange for ownership assignment of all patent rights associated with renazorbtm and renalantm compounds to spectrum 
spectrum must also pay us future milestone and royalty payments as they develop revenues for these compounds 
on december   we sold all of these shares and realized a loss on sale of investment of  accounts receivable accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers for services and product sales  net of an allowance for losses 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing each customer account and specifically identifying any potential for loss 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows in thousands of dollars beginning balance  january  additions charged to costs and expenses net deductions write offs  net of collections ending balance  december  inventory we value our inventories generally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques 
the standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted every three months 
overhead rates are recorded to inventory based on normal capacity 
any idle facility costs or excessive spoilage are recorded as current period charges 
as of december   we recorded a  inventory valuation allowance due to quality issues with our cell supplier  of which  is recorded as a receivable from our vendor covered under their product warranty 
as of december   we had  of inventory valuation allowance recorded 
research and development expenditures the costs of materials  equipment  or facilities that are acquired or constructed for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred 
research and development expenditures related to materials and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized when acquired or constructed 
research and development expenditures  which include the cost of materials consumed in r esearch and development activities  salaries  wages and other costs of personnel engaged in research and development  costs of services performed by others for research and development on our behalf and indirect costs are expensed as research and development costs when incurred 
foreign currency translation asset and liability accounts  which are originally recorded in the appropriate local currencies  are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates 
revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates for the period 
transaction gains and losses are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
substantially all of our assets are located in the united states of america 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
our estimate of the cash flows is based on the information available at the time including the following internal budgets  sales forecasts  customer trends  anticipated production volumes  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset which may range from to years for most equipment and up to years for our building and related building improvements 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair value based upon market prices  or if not available  upon discounted cash flow value  at an appropriate discount determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the business model 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires us to make significant estimates and consider the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
our assumptions about future sales and production volumes require significant judgment because actual sales prices and volumes have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
until the company s products reach commercialization  the demand for our products is difficult to estimate 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whethe r an impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product or the assets used to produce it  a history of operating or cash flow losses and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are greater than our million investment in long lived assets 
our estimated future cash flows include anticipated product sales  commercial collaborations  and contracts and grant revenue  since our long lived asset base  which is primarily composed of production  laboratory and testing equipment is utilized to fulfill contracts in all revenue categories 
as a result of management s determination to focus on the power and energy segment of the business and reduce resources committed to performance materials and life sciences  in combination with the delays experienced in commercializing our products  the following qualitative reviews were performed regarding our patents and fixed assets in addition to an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if our long lived assets are impaired in the first quarter of  we reviewed our four capitalized patents and determined that three of these patents had value in excess of their net book value of  at that time 
in the first quarter  we determined that the fourth patent no longer had value 
the fourth patent had an original cost of  accumulated depreciation of  and a net value of  accordingly  an impairment charge of  was recorded  and is reflected for the twelve months ended december  during the third quarter of  we reviewed the remaining three capitalized patents and determined that these patents had value in excess of their net book value of  as of december  alsher currently has an exclusive license to use this technology from altair 
based on our assessment  which represents no change from the prior year in our approach to valuing long lived assets  after recording the impairment described above  we believe that our long lived assets are not impaired 
property  plant and equipment held and used are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the following useful lives furniture and office equipment years vehicles years nanoparticle production equipment years building and improvements years we have property  plant and equipment that is held and not used stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the useful lives established for property  plant and equipment held and used 
property plant and equipment  net held and not used included assets being redeployed from our life sciences and performance materials divisions  into our power and energy group 
we redeployed these assets during the second quarter of into our power and energy group or transferred to sherwin williams through our transfer of alsher titania  llc on april  patents related to the nanoparticle production technology are carried at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues were derived from product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a complet ed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
payments received in advance relating to the future performance of services or deliveries of products are deferred until the performance of the service is complete or the product is shipped 
upfront payments received in connection with certain righ ts granted in contractual arrangements are deferred and revenue is recognized over the related time period which the benefits are received 
based on specific customer bill and hold agreements  revenue is recognized when the inventory is shipped to a third party storage warehouse  the inventory is segregated and marked as sold  the customer takes the full rights of ownership and title to the inventory upon shipment to the warehouse per the bill and hold agreement 
when contract terms include multiple components that are considered separate units of accounting  the revenue is attributed to each component and revenue recognition may occur at different points in time for product shipment  installation  and service contracts based on substantial completion of the earnings process 
accrued warranty we provide a limited warranty for battery packs and energy storage systems 
a liability is recorded for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold 
since these are new products  the estimated cost of warranty coverage is based on cell and module life cycle testing and compared for reasonableness to warranty rates on competing battery products 
as sufficient actual historical data is collected on the new product  the estimated cost of warranty coverage will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for estimated warranty obligations may also be adjust ed based on specific warranty issues identified 
non controlling interest in april  the sherwin williams company sherwin entered into an agreement with us to form alsher titania llc alsher  a delaware limited liability company 
alsher is a joint venture combining certain technologies of ours and sherwin in order to develop and produce titanium dioxide pigment for use in paint and coatings and nano titanium dioxide materials for use in a variety of applications  including those related to removing contaminants from air and water 
pursuant to a contribution agreement dated april  among sherwin  alsher  and us  we contributed to alsher an exclusive license to use o ur technology including our hydrochloride pigment process for the production of titanium dioxide pigment and other titanium containing materials other than battery or nanoelectrode materials and certain pilot plant assets with a net book value of  we received no consideration for the license granted to alsher other than our ownership interest in alsher 
sherwin agreed to contribute to alsher cash and a license agreement related to a technology for the manufacture of titanium dioxide using the digestion of ilmenite in hydrochloric acid 
as a condition to enter into the second phase of the joint venture  we agreed to complete the pigment pilot processing plant and related development activities by january the ton pigment pilot processing plant was commissioned in february and the costs associated with this effort were partially reimbursed by alsher 
we contribute any work in process and fixed assets associated with completion of the pigment pilot processing plant to the alsher joint venture 
for each reporting period  alsher is consolidated with our subsidiaries because we have a controlling interest in alsher and any inter company transactions are eliminated refer to note basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements 
the non controlling shareholder s interest in the net assets and net income or loss of alsher are reported as non controlling interest in subsidiary on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and as non controlling interest share in the condensed consolidated statement of operations  respectively 
asset impairment of million in relates to the expense of adjusting alsher titania  llc assets to fair market value as of december  these assets were temporarily idled throughout as we searched for an interested party to acquire our interests in alsher titania 
on april   we sold our share in the alsher titania joint venture to sherwin williams 
we recorded a gain of  on discontinued operations that was comprised of  loss on disposal of fixed assets and  remaining equity in noncontrolling interest 
overhead allocation facilities overhead  which is comprised primarily of occupancy and related expenses  are initially recorded in general and administrative expenses and then allocated to research and development and product inventories based on relative labor costs 
net loss per common share basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period
