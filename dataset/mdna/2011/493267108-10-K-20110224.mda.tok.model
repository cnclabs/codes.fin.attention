income taxes throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we use certain acronyms and abbreviations 
these terms are defined in note summary of significant accounting policies which begins on page 
table of contents introduction this section generally reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years 
some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater detail 
when you read this discussion  you should also consult the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report 
the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the preceding table of contents 
terminology throughout this discussion  references to key  we  our  us and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries 
keycorp refers solely to the parent holding company  and keybank refers to keycorp s subsidiary bank  keybank national association 
we want to explain some industry specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows 
in september  we decided to discontinue the education lending business 
in april  we decided to wind down the operations of austin capital management  ltd  a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers 
as a result of these decisions  we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations 
we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and austin 
our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations 
these portfolios  which are in a run off mode  stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy 
these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments 
we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment 
these activities encompass a variety of products and services 
among other things  we trade securities as a dealer  enter into derivative contracts both to accommodate clients financing needs and for proprietary trading purposes  and conduct transactions in foreign currencies both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates 
for regulatory purposes  capital is divided into two classes 
federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one half of a bank or bank holding company s total risk based capital must qualify as tier capital 
both total and tier capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy  which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition 
as described in the section entitled economic overview  in  the regulators initiated an additional level of review of capital adequacy for the country s nineteen largest banking institutions  including keycorp 
this regulatory assessment continued during and as part of this capital adequacy review  banking regulators evaluated a component of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
for a detailed explanation of total capital  tier capital and tier common equity  and how they are calculated see the section entitled capital 
during the first quarter of  we re aligned our reporting structure for our segments 
previously  the consumer finance business group consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our key corporate bank segment 
we are now reflecting these exit portfolios in other segments 
the automobile dealer floor plan business  previously included in consumer finance  has been re aligned with the commercial banking line of business within the key community bank segment 
in addition  other previously identified exit portfolios included in the key corporate bank segment  including our homebuilder loans from the real estate capital line of business and commercial leases from the equipment finance line of business  have been moved to other segments 
for more detailed financial information pertaining to each segment and its respective lines of business  see note line of business results 
long term financial goals our long term financial goals are as follows target a loan to core deposit ratio range of to 
return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge off ratio range of 
to 
grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of and noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 
create positive operating leverage and complete keyvolution run rate savings goal of million to million by the end of achieve a return on average assets in the range of to

corporate strategy we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value by having a strong balance sheet  consistent earnings growth  and a focus on risk adjusted returns 
we are achieving these goals by implementing our client insight driven relationship strategy  which is built on enduring relationships  client focused solutions with extraordinary client service  and a robust risk management culture 
our strategic priorities for enhancing shareholder value and for creating sustainable long term value were as follows drive sustainable  profitable growth through disciplined execution 
we strive for continuous improvement in our business 
we continue to focus on increasing revenues  controlling costs  and returning to a moderate risk profile in our loan portfolios 
further  we will continue to leverage technology and other workforce initiatives to achieve these objectives 
expand  retain and acquire client relationships 
we work to deepen relationships with existing clients and to build targeted relationships with new clients  particularly those that have the potential to purchase multiple products and services or to generate repeat business 
we aim to better understand our clients and to devise better ways to meet their needs by regularly seeking client feedback and using those insights to improve our products and services 
we will strengthen the alignment between our key corporate bank and key community bank to ensure we deliver the whole array of products and services to our clients 
our relationship strategy and commitment to extraordinary service serve as the foundation for everything we do 
operate within a robust risk management culture 
we will continue to align our risk tolerances with our corporate strategies and goals  and increase risk awareness throughout the company 
our employees must have a clear understanding of our risk tolerance with regard to factors such as asset quality  operational risk and liquidity levels to ensure that we operate within our desired risk appetite 
sustain strong reserves  capital and liquidity 
we intend to stay focused on sustaining strong reserves and capital  which we believe is important not only in today s environment  but also to support future growth opportunities 
we also remain committed to maintaining strong liquidity and funding positions 
attract and retain a capable  diverse and engaged workforce 
we are committed to investing in our workforce to optimize the talent in our organization 
we will continue to stress the importance of training  retaining  developing and challenging our employees 
we believe this is essential to succeeding on all of our priorities 

table of contents strategic developments we initiated the following actions during and to support our corporate strategy during the fourth quarter of  we announced that henry l 
meyer will retire on may   and that beth e 
mooney was elected president and chief operating officer of keycorp and a member of keycorp s board of directors 
mooney will assume the additional role of chairman and chief executive officer on may   and become the first woman ceo of a top us bank 
mooney  who has over years of experience in retail banking  commercial lending  and real estate financing  was previously vice chair of keycorp and head of key s community bank business 
three consecutive profitable quarters in and profit for the entire year 
this positive trend was due to higher pre provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses 
the growth in pre provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin and net interest income  well controlled expenses and improvements in several fee based businesses 
we scored significantly higher than our four largest banking competitors in a third quarter of customer satisfaction survey conducted by the american customer satisfaction index 
our scores were significantly better than bank industry scores across the multiple dimensions  most notably in customer loyalty 
our asset quality metrics significantly improved across the majority of our loan portfolios as we proactively addressed credit quality issues 
nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans decreased 
additionally  net loan charge offs declined compared to the prior year 
our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital  liquidity and reserve levels 
in august  we issued million of year senior unsecured debt at the holding company 
during and  we opened new branches and renovated approximately others 
we expect to open new branches in as part of our long term plan to modernize and strengthen our presence in select markets 
during  we settled all outstanding federal income tax issues with the irs for the tax years  including all outstanding leveraged lease tax issues for all open tax years 
during the third quarter of  we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business  following earlier actions taken in the third quarter of to cease private student lending 
as a result of this decision  we have accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued operation 
additionally  we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets 
during the second quarter of  we decided to wind down the operations of austin  a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers 
as a result of this decision  we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation 
in late  we began a corporate wide initiative designed to build a consistently superior experience for our clients  simplify processes  improve speed to market  and enhance our ability to seize growth and profit opportunities 
as of december   we have achieved million of the targeted run rate savings toward our goal of achieving million to million by the end of over the past three years  we have been exiting certain noncore businesses  such as retail marine and education lending  and have been modernizing our state branch network  coupled with enhancing our online banking to provide clients with a breadth of options that meet their specific banking needs 
as a result of these and other efforts  over the last two years  our workforce has been reduced by  average full time equivalent employees 
economic overview the strength of the economic recovery in the united states varied throughout  however  the year ended with a positive tone 
during the first quarter  gross domestic product gdp increased  the second biggest quarterly increase since the recession began in december of gdp growth continued into the second and third quarters  although at a lower level 
the average quarterly gdp growth of for the first three quarters of represents a significant improvement from the average quarterly change in gdp of 
and also outpaces the ten year average of 
growth in was supported by businesses rebuilding inventory levels and capital spending on equipment and software 
growth was also sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending  which grew at an average monthly rate of 
for  matching the rate of growth in despite the strength in consumer spending  employers remained reluctant to add a significant number of employees to payrolls 
us payrolls increased by 
million during  compared to a decline of million in was the first year of job growth since the recession began 
over million americans lost their jobs during the recession 
the unemployment rate declined to in december of  compared to in december of 
table of contents housing continued to be a drag on consumer wealth in as home buying activity declined after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit  offered as part of the the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of historically low mortgage rates were not enough to attract buyers 
sales of existing homes declined by in compared to a rise in the median price of existing homes in december declined from december  compared to a annual decline a year earlier 
a reduced level of foreclosures helped to stabilize existing home prices 
the number of foreclosures in december declined from the december level 
new home sales declined by in  compared to a decline in the median price of new homes increased by 
new home construction in december declined from the same month in due to an improved economic outlook and functioning of the financial markets  the federal reserve ceased its purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities and closed most of its emergency liquidity facilities during the first quarter of as the economic outlook moderated during the second and third quarters  the federal reserve decided at the november federal open market committee meeting to reinstate quantitative easing through additional agency security purchases 
the federal reserve also held the federal funds target rate near zero throughout all of benchmark term interest rates declined during due to these federal reserve actions and expectations of a slow economic recovery 
during  investors sought the safety of treasury securities at times of heightened fears related to the european sovereign debt crisis 
as a result of these factors  the benchmark two year treasury yield decreased to 
at december   from at december   and the ten year treasury yield decreased to at december  from at december  regulatory reform developments on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
this act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states  reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises  and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies 
the dodd frank act implements numerous and far reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies  including banks and bank holding companies such as key 
for a review of the various changes that the dodd frank act implements  see the supervision and regulation regulatory reform in item business of this report 
many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and or implemented 
interchange fees on december   the federal reserve released proposed rules governing interchange fees that merchants pay to banks when consumers make purchases with their debit cards the proposal 
the proposal would implement provisions of the dodd frank act 
the proposal was open for public comment through february   with the federal reserve expecting implementation of any proposed interchange fee standards by july   should the proposal be adopted 
as previously announced  we currently estimate that approximately million in debit interchange revenue could be impacted by the proposal 
until the regulations are finalized by the federal reserve  it is premature to assess the impact on this combined revenue stream of the proposal 
it is possible that the effect could be significant to the revenue we derive from these activities 
regulation e pursuant to the electronic fund transfer act of during the third quarter of  the federal reserve s final rules regarding regulation e became effective 
regulation e is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers 
regulation e became effective july   for new clients and on august   for existing clients 
regulation e  among other items  prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client without receiving consent from the client to opt in to the financial institutions overdraft services for atm and everyday debit card transactions 
based on the number of clients whom have opted in  we estimate the impact to us was an annualized decline of approximately million in our deposit service charge income during the fourth quarter of this decline is consistent with our previously reported expectations 
however  this amount is subject to change as additional clients make their overdraft decisions 
fdic rulemaking developments several significant developments have impacted deposit insurance assessments 
substantially all of keybank s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 
the fdic assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a risk based assessment rate 
under the risk based assessment system in effect during  annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from 
to 
for each of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution s risk category 
this system will remain in effect for the first quarter of in  the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and 
table of contents the amount of keybank s assessment prepayment was million 
for  our fdic insurance assessment was million 
as of december   we had million of prepaid fdic insurance assessment recorded on our balance sheet 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  and requires the dif reserve ratio to increase to by september   rather than by december   as previously required 
to implement these and other changes to the current deposit insurance assessment regime  the fdic issued several proposed rules in on february   the fdic adopted their final rule on assessments 
under the final rule  which is effective on april   keybank s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from 
to 
for each of its new assessment base  depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating keybank s regulatory rating  ability to withstand asset and funding related stress  and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank s failure 
we estimate that our expense for deposit insurance assessments will be to million 
demographics we have two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 
the effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business segments operate 
key community bank serves consumers and small to mid sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit  investment  lending and wealth management products and services 
these products and services are provided through a state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions rocky mountains and northwest  great lakes  and northeast 
commercial and industrial loan growth in our middle market portfolio is improving 
we are particularly encouraged as we experienced commercial loan growth during the fourth quarter of in the northeast region 
trends are improving in the great lakes  rocky mountains and northwest regions as the economic recovery migrates across the country 
merger and acquisition activity is also increasing and we expect businesses to begin to draw on their available credit facilities and cash to make investments in their production capabilities that have been postponed over the past several years 
figure shows the geographic diversity of our key community bank segment s average core deposits  commercial loans and home equity loans

key corporate bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally  within and beyond our state branch network  as well as internationally 
the real estate capital and corporate banking services business consists of two business units 
real estate capital provides lending  debt placements  servicing  and equity and investment banking services to developers  brokers and owner investors dealing primarily with nonowner occupied properties 
corporate banking provides a full array of commercial banking products and cash management services 
equipment finance meets the equipment leasing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers  distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients 
the institutional and capital markets business consists of two business units 
keybanc capital markets provides commercial lending  treasury management  investment banking  derivatives  foreign exchange  equity and debt underwriting and trading  and 
table of contents syndicated finance products and services to large corporations and middle market companies 
victory capital management manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios for a national client base 
additional information regarding the products and services offered by our key community bank and key corporate bank segments are described further in this report in note line of business 
since the beginning of the financial crisis  results for key corporate bank have been adversely affected by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets 
in  credit losses in the key corporate bank declined and the overall recovery in the equity markets led to growth in the market values of assets under management  and stability in the market value of other assets primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading 
we saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of we used this as an opportunity to continue to sell certain of our nonperforming assets 
we were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at prices that were close to their carrying value as recorded on our books 
figure  which appears later in this report in the loans and loans held for sale section  shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location 
as previously reported  we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and  since december   we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties portion of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by billion  or  to million 
additional information about loan sales is included in the credit risk management section 
critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex 
consequently  we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies 
these choices are critical  not only are they necessary to comply with gaap  they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 
in our opinion  some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance  or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances  they may prove to be inaccurate  or we may find it necessary to change them 
we rely heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions 
a brief discussion of each of these areas follows 
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses 
for example  we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  lending policies  underwriting standards  and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
for all tdr s  regardless of size  as well as all other impaired loans with an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
for example  a specific allowance may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain that the loan will be repaid in full 
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate 
the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly  and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower 
however  since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects  and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating  we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 
at december   the key community bank reporting unit had million in goodwill  while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill 
in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions  we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses 
for example  class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg  one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment 
conversely  the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile 
in either case  historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

table of contents even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management s determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio 
to illustrate  an increase in estimated losses equal to one tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december   would indicate the need for a million increase in the level of the allowance 
the same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a million increase in the allowance 
such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results 
following the above examples  a million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share  a million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share 
as we make decisions regarding the allowance  we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes 
nonetheless  if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate  the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted  possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
valuation methodologies effective january   we adopted the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models  which are based on third party data as well as our judgment  assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality  liquidity  interest rates and other relevant market available inputs 
we describe our adoption of this accounting guidance  the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note under the heading fair value measurements and in note fair value measurements 
at december   billion  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these assets were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
at december   billion  or  of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level or level at december   million  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
approximately of these assets were classified as level or level at december   there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
to determine the values of assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  including loans held for sale  principal investments  goodwill  and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note under the heading loans held for sale 
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments  predominantly in privately held companies 
the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors  including the target company s financial condition and results of operations  values of public companies in comparable businesses  market liquidity  and the nature and duration of resale restrictions 
the fair value of principal investments was million at december   a positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our earnings by approximately million million after tax  or 
per share 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 
fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach 
we perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable 
however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit 
table of contents representing the unit s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit s net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
as a result of our sale of tuition management systems in december  customer relationship intangible assets of million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during during  we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of million million after tax  or 
per common share 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges 
due to the economic uncertainty experienced since  we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill  as necessary 
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses  including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions  are presented in note employee benefits 
when potential asset impairment is identified  we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie  temporary or other than temporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment 
for example  unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity  those deemed other than temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors 
additional information regarding temporary and other than temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december   is provided in note securities 
derivatives and hedging we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes 
these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance  which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements 
accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance  as well as to assess hedge effectiveness  identify similar hedged item groupings  and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices 
however  interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve 
in the future  these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities 
although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition  a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note under the heading derivatives and note derivatives and hedging activities 
contingent liabilities  guarantees and income taxes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor  and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations  are summarized in note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees 
we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee  but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount 
see note for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december  it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake 
in the normal course of business  we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities 
we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate 
however  if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate  the tax reserves may need to be adjusted  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 
additionally  we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized  and therefore recorded 
the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods  projected future taxable income  potential tax planning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items 
these assessments are subjective and may change 
based on these criteria  and in particular our projections for future taxable income  we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods 
however  changes to the evidence used in our assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
table of contents operations in the period in which they occur 
for further information on our accounting for income taxes  see note income taxes 
during  we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

in april  we decided to wind down the operations of austin  a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers 
as a result of these decisions  we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts 
included in the loss from discontinued operations in is a charge for intangible assets impairment related to austin 
the earnings improvement in resulted from improved pre provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses when compared to results in were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses  write offs of certain intangible assets and write downs of certain commercial real estate related investments 
with three consecutive profitable quarters  and continued signs of increased economic activity on the part of our clients  we believe that we are positioned well to compete with other businesses in our core financial measures strong capital  enhanced liquidity  adequate loan and lease loss reserves  as well as our exit from riskier lending categories represent a firm foundation for the year ahead 
net interest margin from continuing operations was for this was an increase of basis points from this increase was primarily due to lower funding costs  which began in the latter part of we continue to experience an improvement in our mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts 
this benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay downs on loans 
during  our net interest margin was under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels throughout the year 
this resulted in a larger decrease in interest rates on earning assets than that experienced on interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents we saw an increase in loan demand within our core commercial client base during the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of our exit portfolios  our commercial and industrial and leasing portfolios both experienced loan growth for the first time since the fall of however  there can be no assurance this will continue in  as many clients have sufficient liquidity resources to meet current operating needs 
in  credit quality also continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both key community bank and key corporate bank 
net loan charge offs and nonperforming loans declined each quarter during at december   nonperforming assets stood at their lowest level since the third quarter of net charge offs for were billion  a decrease of million from during the same period  commercial loan net charge offs decreased by million  primarily driven by lower charge offs from the commercial real estate construction portfolio 
at december   our nonperforming loans totaled billion and represented of period end portfolio loans  compared to at december  nonperforming assets at december  totaled billion and represented of portfolio loans  oreo and other nonperforming assets  compared to billion and at december  most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural  the real estate commercial mortgage  and the real estate construction portfolios 
our exit loan portfolio accounted for million  or  of total nonperforming assets at december   compared to million  or  at december  our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to billion from billion one year ago 
at december   our allowance represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans compared to and  respectively at december  one of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio 
in addition  we are continuing to work down the loan portfolios that have been identified for exit to improve our risk adjusted returns 
further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled credit risk management 
at december   our tier common equity and tier risk based capital ratios were and  compared to and  respectively at december  in  we completed a series of successful transactions that generated approximately billion of new tier i common equity to strengthen our overall capital 
additionally  we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions during while in the midst of weak loan demand and a soft economy 
our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was for the fourth quarter of  compared to for the fourth quarter of this improvement was accomplished by growing our noninterest bearing deposits  now and money market deposits  reducing our reliance on wholesale funding  exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities 
during  we originated approximately billion in new or renewed lending commitments 
over the last two years  we have opened new branches and renovated approximately others  expanding key s state branch network to  branches 
further  we plan to build an additional new branches in we also recently announced that we scored significantly higher than our four largest competitor banks in a third quarter of customer satisfaction survey conducted by the american customer satisfaction index

c certain financial data for periods prior to have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of our january   adoption of new accounting guidance regarding the offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
figure presents certain financial measures related to tangible common equity and tier common equity 
the tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors 
we believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
since the commencement of the scap in early  the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier risk based capital known as tier common equity 
because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity essentially tier risk based capital less preferred stock  qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier risk based capital  this focus on tier common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories 
this increased focus on tier common equity is also present in the basel committee s basel iii guidelines  which us regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations expected to be issued in the summer of the enactment of the dodd frank act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities excluding tarp cpp preferred stock issued to the united states or any federal government entity before october  being treated as tier eligible capital 
this three year phase out period  which commences january   will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier capital 
tier common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  this measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier common equity  we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 
figure also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non gaap measures 
the table also shows the computation for pre provision net revenue  which is not formally defined by gaap 
management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

table of contents income was a million improvement in net losses from loan sales  a million improvement in investment banking income  and a million gain from the sale of tuition management systems in december the growth in noninterest income was offset in part by a million decrease in trust and investment services income which was primarily due to reduced brokerage commissions in the institutional and capital markets line of business 
noninterest income was also adversely impacted by a million decline in operating lease revenue and a million decrease in letter of credit fees 
the provision for loan and lease losses declined by billion from  reflecting lower levels of net loan charge offs  primarily from the commercial loan portfolio 
key corporate bank s provision for loan and lease losses was less than net loan charge offs by million as we continued to experience improved asset quality

results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loan related fee income  and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
there are several factors that affect net interest income  including the volume  pricing  mix and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the volume and value of net free funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and equity capital  the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk  interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace  and asset quality 
to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable  some not  we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable equivalent basis ie  as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate 
for example  of tax exempt income would be presented as  an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of would yield figure shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense  and their respective yields or rates over the past six years 
this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years 
the net interest margin  which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding  is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
taxable equivalent net interest income for was billion  and the net interest margin was 
these results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of billion and a net interest margin of for the prior year 
the increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs 
we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts 
this benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset during by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year resulting primarily from pay downs on loans 
we also experienced improved yields on loans due to lower levels of nonperforming loans 
compared to the prior year  funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long term debt and the exchanges of capital securities for our common shares 
in the prior year  the net interest margin remained under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels 
this resulted in a larger decrease in the interest rates on earning assets than that experienced for interest bearing liabilities 
further compression of the net interest margin came from higher levels of nonperforming assets and the termination of certain leveraged lease financing arrangements 
average earning assets for totaled billion  which was billion  or  lower than the level 
this reduction reflects a billion decrease in loans during the year  caused by soft demand for credit  paydowns on our portfolios as 
table of contents commercial clients deleveraged  and the run off in our exit portfolios 
the decline in loans was partially offset by an increase of billion in securities available for sale 
the size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during and we sold billion of commercial real estate loans during and billion during since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse ie  there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements  we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate 
more information about the related recourse agreement is provided in note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees under the heading recourse agreement with fnma 
in addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above  we sold other loans totaling billion including billion of residential real estate loans during and billion including billion of residential real estate loans during in the fourth quarter of  we transferred loans with a fair value of million from held for sale status to the held to maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans 
we sold million of education loans included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet during  and million during in late september  we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report 
we transferred million of loans million  net of million in net charge offs from the held to maturity loan portfolio to held for sale status in late september  in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets

trust and investment services income trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income 
the primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in figure the decrease of million  or  is primarily attributable to lower fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and fees 
the increase in personal asset management and custody fees is largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional asset management and custody fees

at december   our bank  trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 
table of contents billion  compared to billion at december  as shown in figure  most of the decrease was attributable to reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios  offset by an increase in the equity portfolio 
the decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities  a decline on spreads  and client departures 
when clients securities are lent out  the borrower must provide us with cash collateral  which is invested during the term of the loan 
the difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client 
this business  although profitable  generates a significantly lower rate of return commensurate with the lower level of risk than other types of assets under management 
the decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies 
the decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter decision to wind down the operations of austin

service charges on deposit accounts the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts is due primarily to changing client behaviors involving lower overdraft transactions  which generate overdraft fees as well as a decline in other deposit service charge related fees 
a recent component of the decrease was due to the implementation of regulation e  which went into effect on july   for new clients and august  for our existing clients 
the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated with existing regulation e rules was in line with our expectations 
the decrease from to was due primarily to lower overdraft transactions  which generated fewer overdraft fees 
additionally  because of the prevailing low interest rates and unlimited fdic insurance  our corporate clients maintained larger amounts on deposit  which has the effect of reducing transaction service charges on their noninterest bearing deposit accounts

personnel as shown in figure  personnel expense  the largest category of our noninterest expense  decreased by million  or  in  following a million  or  decline in from the decrease was due largely to a million decrease in our employee benefits expense 
the employee benefits expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions

the decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most of our portfolios  with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio 
commercial loan portfolio commercial loans outstanding were billion at december   a decrease of billion  or  since december  this decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients use of the strength of the capital markets to raise debt and equity  pay downs on our portfolios and the run off in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk 
we are beginning to see pockets of improvements in commercial lending as business is strengthening in certain regions

the loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large  middle market and small business clients 
these loans decreased billion or from one year ago

this compares to an increase of million during  which was due to the deteriorating market conditions in both the income properties and residential properties segments of our commercial real estate construction portfolio 
as previously reported  we have undertaken a process to reduce our exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans 
the secondary market for income property loans has been severely constrained for the past three years and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
in years prior to the economic downturn  we did not provide permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects  permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage backed securities market or other lenders 
with other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained  we are currently providing interim financing for certain of our relationship clients when their commercial real estate construction projects are completed 
during and  we extended the maturities  for up to five years  of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion 
we applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longer term extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees  offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate  to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates 
in cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements  we have transferred these loans to the asset recovery group for resolution 
in  there were million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans  of which million related to commercial real estate 
as shown in figure  at december   of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner occupied properties  compared to at december  approximately and of these loans were construction loans at december  and  respectively 
typically  these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan 
the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments 
uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases  driving rental rates and occupancy rates down 
as we have experienced during  we expect vacancy rates for retail  office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom  and certain sectors ie  apartments are showing solid signs of improvement 
according to property and portfolio research  inc  vacancy fell in the third quarter of in every major property type  but it remained above year ago levels with the exception of apartments 
rent growth remains flat to negative again with the exception of apartments  and is at or nearing a trough  however  modest declines are possible over the next year in office  retail  and warehouse property types 
once rents bottom  the anticipated recovery will likely be modest 
if the economic recovery stalls  and or job growth continues to disappoint  vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain 
the resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio  particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components  which comprise of our commercial real estate loans 
commercial property values peaked in the fall of  having experienced increases of approximately since and since the most recent moody s real estate analytics  llc commercial property price index december shows a drop in values from the peak  up in the past year 
as of october  prices were up a modest over the prior month  the second consecutive monthly gain 
while overall prices may be reaching a bottom  market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location 
competition for the best assets in the top markets is driving prices higher  while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative 
if the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market ie  vacancy rates  the stability of rental income and asset values  and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments  our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 
commercial lease financing 
we conduct financing arrangements through our equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business 
commercial lease financing receivables represented of commercial loans at december   and at december  as previously reported  we ceased conducting new business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 
table of contents commercial loan modification and restructuring certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients 
loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower 
in many cases  borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital  collateral  guarantees or income sources 
modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs 
modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  tdr classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 
our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions  principal deferral  or forgiveness of principal 
loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types 
the table below provides the amount of tdrs by the primary type of concession made at each period end 
since our volume of tdr activity is relatively new over the last five quarters  it is too early to gauge the success of the different types of concessions 
our success will be significantly influenced by economic conditions going forward 
although we have restructured these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrowers  given the uncertainty of the current economic situation  we are not able to predict how these restructured notes will ultimately perform 
figure shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs 
figure commercial loan accruing and nonaccruing tdrs december  in millions interest rate reduction forgiveness of principal other modification of loan terms total commercial tdrs a total commercial and consumer tdrs total commercial tdrs to total commercial loans total commercial tdrs to total loans total commercial loans total loans a prior to  the amounts of tdrs were negligible  and therefore we have not included such periods in the figure above 
figure quantifies restructured loans  tdrs  using our three note structure 
figure commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status december  in millions commercial tdrs by note type tranche a tranche b tranche c total commercial tdrs a commercial tdrs by accrual status nonaccruing accruing held for sale total commercial tdrs a total commercial and consumer tdrs a prior to  the amounts of tdrs were negligible  and therefore we have not included such periods in the figure above 

table of contents the benefits derived from multiple note tdrs are recognized when the underlying assets predominantly commercial real estate have been stabilized with a level of leverage supportable by ongoing cash flows 
right sizing the a note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition 
similarly  appropriately sized a notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance 
other benefits include the borrower s retention of ownership and control of the asset  deleveraged and sustainable capital structure often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed fire sales 
as the objective of the multiple notes tdr is to achieve a fully performing and well rated a note  we focus on sizing the a note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards 
this typically will include a debt coverage ratio of or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than years 
the b note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal 
the b note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the a note is under consideration 
in many cases  the b note has then been charged off contemporaneously with the a note being returned to accrual status 
alternatively  both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above 
in many cases where a three a  b  c note structure has been utilized  the c notes are fully charged off at the time of the tdr 
in the very few instances where the c note is not charged off  there is a pending equity event  additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the c note balance shortly after the tdr 
all loans processed as a tdr  including a notes and any non charged off b or c notes  are reported as tdrs during the year in which they are consummated 
returning an a note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time 
our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status 
primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment collateral is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the a note with a sufficient excess generally 
although our policy is a guideline  considerable judgment is required to review each borrower s circumstances 
extensions certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients 
project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity  however  due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates  an increased number of loans have been extended 
extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship  the status of the project and near term prospects for both the client and the collateral 
in all cases  pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms ie  amortization  covenants and term that are appropriate for the risk 
typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown  increased amortization  additional collateral  increased guarantees  and or a cash flow sweep 
as previously mentioned  some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option  pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 
most project loans by their nature are collateral dependent as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan 
pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any 
therefore  pricing may remain the same eg  the loan is already priced at or above current market 
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs  particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made 
in the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made  we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr 
extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 
guarantors a detailed guarantor analysis is conducted for all new extensions of credit  at the time of any material modification extension  and typically annually  as part of our on going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures 
this analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets  income statements  tax returns  and real estate schedules 
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences  the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities  including size  quality  and nature of asset base  
table of contents net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value  leverage  standing liquidity  recurring cash flow  contingent and direct debt obligations  and near term debt maturities 
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within days of the calendar fiscal year end 
income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly 
in some cases  disclosure of certain information including liquidity  certifications  status of asset sales or debt resolutions  and real estate schedules may be required more frequently 
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt  if the guarantor is solvent 
in limited circumstances  we would not seek to enforce the guaranty  including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor s verified financial condition 
we are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss  cost and the expense of collections 
as of december   we had million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than and were accounted for as performing loans 
these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization  a satisfactory borrower payment history  and acceptable guarantor support 
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding decreased by billion  or  from one year ago 
as shown in figure in the credit risk management section  the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio 
most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment 
the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio 
virtually all of this portfolio at december  is derived primarily from the regional banking line of business within our key community bank 
the remainder of the portfolio  which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of  was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments

as previously reported  we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio 
we expect the portfolio continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products  and discontinue the education lending business 
we ceased originating new education loans effective december  and account for this business in discontinued operations 
in the latter half of  there has been public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders 
our number of home loan foreclosures is small the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by key and third parties  initiated per month  through december  is  compared to approximately  such mortgage loans and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio 
a review of our foreclosure processes which is still ongoing has not uncovered any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits

at december   loans held for sale included million of commercial mortgages which decreased by million from december   and million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by million from december  in the absence of quoted market prices  we use valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost 
the models are based on third party data  as well as assumptions related to prepayment speeds  default rates  funding cost  discount rates and other relevant market available inputs 
in light of the volatility in the financial markets  we have reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect current market conditions 
as a result  no significant adjustments to our assumptions were required during during  we recorded net unrealized losses of million and net realized gains of million on our loans held for sale portfolio 
these net gains are reported in net gains losses from loan sales on the income statement 
we have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry  having exited this business in the fourth quarter of loan sales as shown in figure  during  we sold billion of commercial real estate loans  billion of residential real estate loans  million of commercial loans and million of commercial lease financing 
most of these sales came from the held for sale portfolio 
additionally  we sold million of education loans included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet  which are excluded from figure due to unfavorable market conditions  we have not securitized any education loans since among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy  our a lm needs  the cost of alternative funding sources  the level of credit risk  capital requirements  and market conditions and pricing

table of contents securities available for sale the majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of cmos  which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage backed securities 
cmos generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements 
at december   we had billion invested in cmos and other mortgage backed securities in the available for sale portfolio  compared to billion at december  as shown in figure  all of our mortgage backed securities are issued by government sponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we employ an outside bond pricing service to determine the fair value at which these securities should be recorded on the balance sheet 
in performing the valuations  the pricing service relies on models that consider security specific details  as well as relevant industry and economic factors 
the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices  interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions 
we review valuations derived from the models to ensure they are consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets 
figure mortgage backed securities by issuer december  in millions fhlmc fnma gnma total during  we had net gains of million from cmos and other mortgage backed securities  all of which were unrealized 
the net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the aoci component of shareholders equity 
we continue to maintain a moderate asset sensitive exposure to near term changes in interest rates 
we periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established a lm objectives  changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio  and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed 
these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 
in addition  the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits 
although we generally use debt securities for this purpose  other assets  such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit  are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 
during  our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs

deposits and other sources of funds domestic deposits are our primary source of funding 
during  these deposits averaged billion and represented of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets  compared to billion and during the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure in the section entitled net interest income 
the decrease in average domestic deposits compared to was due to a decline in certificates of deposit  or more and other time deposits 
this decline was offset by an increase in now and money market deposit accounts  and noninterest bearing deposits 
the mix of deposits continues to change as higher costing certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts  such as now and money market savings accounts  or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low rate environment 
wholesale funds  consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short term borrowings  averaged billion during  compared to billion during the change resulted from a million increase in foreign office deposits and a million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which was offset partially by a billion decline in bank notes and other short term borrowings 
substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 
accordingly  we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic 
on november   the fdic published a final rule to announce an amended dif restoration plan requiring depository institutions  such as keybank  to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the third and fourth quarters of and for all of  and on that date  keybank paid the fdic million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods 
for  our fdic insurance assessment was million 
at the end of the year  we had million of prepaid fdic insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet 
on february   the fdic adopted their final rule on assessments 
under the final rule  which is effective on april   keybank s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from

capital availability and management as a result of market disruptions in previous periods  we closely monitor the availability of capital which had been severely restricted for financial services companies to different degrees since august while we have been successful in raising additional capital  lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per common share results 
while the capital markets have recently been more favorable  we cannot predict whether those more favorable market conditions will continue 
we determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses 
in that regard  we will continue to emphasize our client relationship strategy 
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance 
all of our capital ratios remain strong at december  our strong capital and improved liquidity position us to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the dodd frank act 
our shareholders equity to assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries 
risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market items  subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors 
currently  banks and bank holding companies must maintain  at a minimum  tier capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of and total capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio increased basis points from to  and our total risk based capital ratio increased basis points from to 
another indicator of capital adequacy  the leverage ratio  is defined as tier capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets 
leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution 
bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s risk adjusted measure for market risk as we have must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
all other bhcs must maintain a minimum ratio of 
as of december   our leverage ratio increased by basis points from to 
the enactment of the dodd frank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities excluding cpp preferred stock issued to the united states or any federal government entity before october  being eligible tier risk based capital 
this three year phase out period  which commences january   will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier capital 
these changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs  savings and loan holding companies  and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio  leverage ratio  and total risk based capital ratio represented   and  respectively 
the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp and union state bank capital trusts contribute billion or   and basis points to our tier risk based capital ratio  tier leverage ratio  and total risk based capital ratio  respectively  as of december  under the fdia prompt corrective action standards  federal bank regulators group fdic insured depository institutions into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
a well capitalized institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of for tier risk based capital  for tier leverage capital  for total risk based 
table of contents capital and must not be subject to any written agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
if these provisions applied to bank holding companies  we would qualify as well capitalized at december  we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change 
analysis on a pro forma basis  accounting for the phase out of our trust preferred securities as tier eligible and therefore as tier instead as of december   also determines that we would qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  with the pro forma tier risk based capital ratio  pro forma leverage ratio  and pro forma total capital ratio being   and  respectively 
the current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function 
investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or keybank 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
as a result of the financial crisis  the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier risk based capital  known as tier common equity  and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies  including keycorp 
because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity essentially tier risk based capital less preferred stock  qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier risk based capital  such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard 
the modifications mandated by the dodd frank act are consistent with the renewed focus on tier common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks  bhcs  and covered nonbank financial companies  which resulted from the financial crisis 
because tier common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  this measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure 
figure in the highlights of our performance section reconciles key shareholders equity  the gaap performance measure  to tier common equity  the corresponding non gaap measure 
our tier common equity ratio was at december   compared to at december  at december   we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of million compared to million at december  in prior years  we had been in a net deferred tax liability position 
generally  for risk based capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for the year  or ii of the amount of an institution s tier capital 
based on these restrictions  at december   million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from tier capital and risk weighted assets compared to million at december  we anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk based capital purposes will decline in coming quarters 
basel iii on december   the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  now officially identified as basel iii 
as discussed more fully in this report s supervision and regulation section beginning on page  basel iii requires higher and better quality capital  better risk coverage  the introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk based requirement  measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress  the use of contingent capital to provide an additional level of protection for depositors and creditors  and the introduction of two global liquidity standards 
basel iii introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for tier common equity 
when the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included  the resulting minimum levels for tier capital and total risk based capital will be higher than the us s current well capitalized minimums 
we have prepared pro forma estimates of our capital ratios using the basel iii capital guidelines 
these estimates indicate that our capital levels are currently above the basel iii minimums  including the capital conservation buffer and the phasing out of trust preferred securities as tier capital pursuant to the dodd frank act 
the us banking regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to basel iii 
the basel iii final capital framework provides for implementation to commence january  in light of basel iii s timeline and us regulators support for basel iii  a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be issued in mid

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off balance sheet arrangements  which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 
variable interest entities a vie is a partnership  limited liability company  trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party 
the entity s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the entity s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns 
the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity  and substantially all of the entity s activities involve  or are conducted on behalf of  investors with disproportionately few voting rights 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations  we also consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity  ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading basis of presentation and note variable interest entities

unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than generally are carried at cost 
investments held by our registered broker dealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria 
these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments

risk management overview like all financial services companies  we engage in business activities and assume the related risks 
the most significant risks we face are credit  liquidity  market  compliance  operational  strategic and reputation risks 
we must properly and effectively 
table of contents identify  assess  measure  monitor  control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability 
certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 
during  our management team continued to enhance our erm program 
our erm committee  which consists of the chief executive officer and other senior executives  is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite 
the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy  policy  framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company 
the erm committee reports to the risk management committee of our board of directors 
annually  the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program  as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories 
we continue to enhance our erm program and related practices and to use a risk adjusted capital framework to manage risks 
this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 
our board of directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise wide risks in a manner that is effective  balanced and adds value for the shareholders 
the board inquires about risk practices  reviews the portfolio of risks  compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances  and receives regular reports about significant risks both actual and emerging 
to assist in these efforts  the board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the audit committee and the risk management committee 
the audit committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit  financial reporting  compliance risk and legal matters  the implementation  management and evaluation of operational risk and controls  information security and fraud risk  and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors 
the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance 
the risk management committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk and liquidity risk including the actions taken to mitigate these risks  as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing 
the risk management committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital 
the risk management committee reviews the erm reports and  in conjunction with the audit committee  reviews reports of material changes to the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee charters  and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 
the audit and risk management committees meet jointly  as appropriate  to discuss matters that relate to each committee s responsibilities 
in addition to regularly scheduled bi monthly meetings  the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 
committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting 
all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 
federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution 
we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks  and comport with regulatory expectations 
market risk management the values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity values  commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective market rates or prices 
for example  the value of a fixed rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase 
similarly  the value of the us dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies 
the holder of a financial instrument faces market risk when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 
most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk  which is inherent in the banking industry  is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity 
such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates  and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity in accordance with our risk appetite  and within policy limits established by the erm committee 
interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates  including economic conditions  the competitive environment within our markets  and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products 
the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk  gap risk  yield curve risk and option risk 

table of contents we face basis risk when floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities reprice at the same time  but in response to different market factors or indices 
under those circumstances  even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing  interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount 
gap risk occurs if interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund for example  deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time 
yield curve risk is the exposure to non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity if interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve 
for example  if medium term interest rates decline  the rates on three to five year automobile loans also will decline  but the cost of one to two year certificates of deposit may not change 
a financial instrument presents option risk when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty 
for example  when interest rates decline  borrowers may choose to prepay fixed rate loans and refinance at a lower rate 
such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment the principal plus some interest  but unless there is a prepayment penalty  that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan 
deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk 
net interest income simulation analysis 
the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and off balance sheet positions and the current and projected interest rate environments 
the simulation assumes that projections of our on and off balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends  targets and plans established by the alco committee and the lines of business  and consensus economic forecasts 
typically  the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  and term rates were to move in a similar fashion 
in light of the low interest rate environment  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months 
after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes  we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment 
the analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables  including other market interest rates and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments 
one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity  including a sustained flat yield curve  an inverted slope yield curve  changes in credit spreads  an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates 
another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities  changes in lending spreads  prepayments on loans and securities  other loan and deposit balance changes  investment  funding and hedging activities  and liquidity and capital management strategies 
simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model 
actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the following inputs balance sheet composition  customer behavior  product pricing  market interest rates  realized investment  hedging and funding activities 
actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from anticipated or unknown events 
we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled  and validate those assumptions on a regular basis 
our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile 
figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at december  and at december   our simulated exposure to a change in short term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive 
alco policy limits for risk management call for the identification of actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 
as shown in figure  we are operating within these limits 

table of contents figure simulated change in net interest income december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment as interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time  we have gradually shifted from a liability sensitive position to an asset sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances 
although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities  improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities  and this has served to moderate further increases in the asset sensitive positioning 
our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume  mix  maturity and pricing of loan and deposit flows 
as changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy  management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile 
the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished  and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing  magnitude  frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re pricing relationships  lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two year horizon 
these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve month horizon 
to capture longer term exposures  we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 
economic value of equity modeling 
eve complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve and twenty four month horizons 
eve measures the extent to which the economic values of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates 
eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths 
under the current level of market interest rates  the calculation of eve under an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points 
this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities 
those assumptions are based on historical behaviors  as well as our expectations 
we identify actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
we are operating within these guidelines 
management of interest rate exposure 
we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate asset liability management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures 
specifically  we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities  issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates  and using derivatives predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
figure shows all swap positions which we hold for a lm purposes 
these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed upon amounts of assets and liabilities ie  notional amounts to another interest rate index 
for example  fixed rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap 
the volume  maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged

derivatives not designated in hedge relationships our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in note we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio 
using two years of historical information  the model estimates the maximum potential one day loss with a confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  five out of trading days  or three to four times each quarter 
we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by the risk capital committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the market risk committee established as part of key s erm program 
at december   the aggregate one day trading limit set by the committee was million 
we are operating within these constraints 
during  our aggregate daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were million  million and million  respectively 
in  our aggregate daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis  we monitor loss limits  use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests 
we report our market risk exposure to the risk management committee of the board of directors 
liquidity risk management we define liquidity as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned  as well as unanticipated  changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis 
this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity  as well as each entity s capacity to manage through adverse conditions 
it also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient funding 
oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the keycorp board s risk management committee  the keybank board of directors  the erm committee and the alco 
these groups regularly review various liquidity reports  including liquidity and funding summaries  liquidity trends  peer comparisons  variance analyses  liquidity projections  hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports 
the reviews generate a discussion of positions  trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make 
when liquidity pressure is elevated  monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive 
we meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues 
in addition  we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds 
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events 
an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency 
examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation  or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

table of contents on november   moody s  a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities  announced the downgrade of ratings of ten large us regional banks  including keybank  previously identified as benefiting from systemic support 
keybank s short term borrowings  senior long term debt and subordinated debt ratings received a one notch downgrade from p to p  a to a  and a to baa  respectively 
the new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by moody s in connection with the securitizations that key services  and impact the ability of keybank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by key and rated by moody s 
these escrow deposit balances range from to billion 
since the downgrade  keybank has been in discussions with moody s regarding an alternative investment vehicle for these funds that would be acceptable to moody s and maintain the funds at keybank 
subsequent to moody s announcement that was publicly issued on january   moody s indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of as a result of this decision by moody s  keybank has determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets 
keybank has ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position 
managing liquidity risk we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding 
in the normal course of business  we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank 
in a heightened monitoring mode  we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently  and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment 
erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods 
ultimately  they estimate the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
we continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio 
during the third quarter of  our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced  though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source 
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period 
as part of the plan  we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding 
the portfolio at december  totaled billion 
the liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of billion of unpledged securities  billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and million of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account 
additionally  as of december   our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion at the federal home loan bank 
long term liquidity strategy our long term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding 
key community bank supports our client insight driven relationship strategy  with the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit based funding to reduce our liquidity risk 
we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor this strategy 
our target loan to deposit ratio is between  which we calculate as total loans  loans held for sale  and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of funding include customer deposits  wholesale funding  liquid assets  and capital 
if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances  we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets 
conversely  excess cash generated by operating  investing and deposit gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 
we actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources  including short and long term debt  and secured borrowings 
liquidity programs we have several wholesale funding programs  which are described in note short term borrowings  which enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning 
table of contents normally 
the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed 
there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 
liquidity for keycorp the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions and occasional guarantees of subsidiary s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences  and pay dividends to shareholders 
our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short term cash position  which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty four months or less with existing liquid assets 
another key measure of parent company liquidity is the liquidity gap  which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons 
we generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods 
typically  the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year  up to the date of dividend declaration 
during  keybank did not pay any dividends to the parent  however  nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent million in dividends 
as of the close of business on december   keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval 
to compensate for the absence of dividends  the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long term debt and stock 
during  the parent made capital infusions of million to keybank  compared to billion during the parent company generally maintains cash and short term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty four months 
at december   the parent company held billion in short term investments  which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations 
during  the parent company issued million of a five year medium term fixed rate senior note 
we believe that this successful issuance demonstrates our ability to access the wholesale funding markets without an fdic guarantee 
additional cash flow at the parent included million of maturing debt  million of interest and dividend payments  and various other cash flows netting to a million outflow 
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past twelve months  we have increased our liquid asset portfolio  which includes overnight and short term investments  as well as unencumbered  high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios 
liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources  as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals 
from time to time  keycorp or its principal subsidiary  keybank  may seek to retire  repurchase or exchange outstanding debt  capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase  privately negotiated transactions or other means 
such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity and capital requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
we generate cash flows from operations  and from investing and financing activities 
during  we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of short term investments to increase the balance of our securities available for sale portfolio 
during  the issuance of common shares was used to fund the reduction of short term borrowings and long term debt and to increase the balance of our securities available for sale portfolio 
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december  and credit ratings our credit ratings at december  are shown in figure we believe that these credit ratings  under normal conditions in the capital markets  will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 
conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of and the third quarter of  however  the availability of credit is limited and the cost of funds is higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption 
figure reflects the credit ratings of keycorp securities at december  if our credit ratings fall below investment grade  that event could have a material adverse effect on us 
such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds  trigger additional collateral or funding requirements  and decrease the number of 
table of contents investors and counterparties willing to lend to us 
ultimately  credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income 
on april   moody s  a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities  indicated that  if enacted into law  the financial reform bill then proposed by senator christopher dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen us banks  including keybank  because the legislation could weaken moody s assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions 
moody s has publicly reported that keycorp holding company ratings did not benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by moody s 
keybank long term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch uplift due to systemic support 
subsequently  on july   moody s announced its review for possible downgrade of the ratings of the ten large us regional banks  including keybank 
according to moody s  the ratings reviewed benefited from an expectation of increased government support since moody s review considered its government support assumptions in light of the recent passage of the dodd frank act 
keybank long term deposit  short term borrowings  senior long term debt  and subordinated long term debt ratings were previously identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade 
on november   moody s announced the downgrade of keybank s short term borrowings  senior long term debt and subordinated debt one notch from p to p  a to a  and a to baa  respectively 
in conjunction with the ratings changes  moody s upgraded their ratings outlook on the ratings from negative to stable 
subsequent to moody s announcement that was publicly issued january   moody s indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits related to our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of for information on the impact that moody s action has had  see note mortgage servicing assets

like other financial services institutions  we make loans  extend credit  purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts  all of which have related credit risk 
credit policy  approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program 
risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies 
these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 
our credit risk management is responsible for credit approval  is independent of our lines of business  and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans 
only credit risk management is authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies 
it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate  but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination  verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter 
most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring 
this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling 
commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings 
the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation  the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility 
default probability is determined based on  among other factors  the financial strength of the borrower  an assessment of the borrower s management  the borrower s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook 
types of exposure  transaction structure and collateral  including credit risk mitigants  affect the expected recovery assessment 

table of contents credit risk management uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans 
these models  known as scorecards  forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant 
the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system  which allows for real time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products 
we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 
we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios 
for individual obligors  we employ a sliding scale of exposure  known as hold limits  which is dictated by the strength of the borrower 
our legal lending limit is approximately billion for any individual borrower 
however  internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to approximately of that amount 
as of december   we had two client relationships with loan commitments of more than million 
the average amount outstanding on these two individual obligor commitments was million at december  in general  our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 
we manage industry concentrations using several methods 
on smaller portfolios  we may set limits based on a percentage of our total loan portfolio 
on larger or higher risk portfolios  we may establish a specific dollar commitment level or a maximum level of economic capital 
in addition to these precautions discussed above  we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives  including the use of credit derivatives primarily credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk 
credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party 
at december   we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations 
we also sell credit derivatives primarily index credit default swaps to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks 
at december   the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was million 
occasionally  we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps 
these transactions with other lenders generated fee income 
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
related gains or losses  as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection  are included in the trading income component of noninterest income 
these swaps decreased our operating results by million for compared to a decrease of million last year 
we also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales 
our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 
selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section

watch and criticized assets watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 
criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead  or have led  to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources  potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources  such as collateral liquidation 
criticized assets showed significant improvement during from one year ago 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was billion  or of loans  compared to billion  or  at december  the allowance includes million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of million at december   compared to million that was allocated for impaired loans of billion one year ago 
for more information about impaired loans  see note asset quality 
at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was of nonperforming loans  compared to at december  we estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
briefly  we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
for all tdrs  regardless of size  as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
a specific allowance also may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full 
the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 
as shown in figure  our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by million  or  during the past twelve months 
in general  this decrease is attributed to an improved economic outlook  more favorable conditions in the capital markets  improvement in client income statements  and continued run off in the exit loan portfolio 
more specifically  this contraction was associated with favorable risk rating migration experienced in the loan portfolio throughout the year  coupled with a decline in loans outstanding and a reduction in our general allowance  which encompasses the application of historical loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics and assessment of factors such as changes in economic condition and changes in credit policies or underwriting standards 
both key community bank and key corporate bank showed a decline in their level of allowance during the largest declines occurred in the real estate capital and corporate banking services and national leasing lines of business 
these lines of business experienced the most significant improvement in the underlying credit metrics which determine the allowance 
our delinquency trends continued to decline during our liability for credit losses on lending related commitments decreased since by million to million at december  when combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses  our total allowance for credit losses represented of loans at the end of compared to at the end of

operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk  which is the risk of loss from violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules and regulations  prescribed practices or ethical standards and contractual obligations 
due to the passage of the dodd frank act  large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance 
this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk 
we have created and continue to create work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act 
resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges  increased operational costs  harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities 
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk  alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance  a system of internal controls and reporting 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws  rules and regulations  and to improve the oversight of our operational risk 
for example  an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses 
this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action 
we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes 
this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 
primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business 
our operational risk management function manages the operational risk management program which provides the framework for the structure  governance  roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key 
the operational risk committee  a senior management committee  oversees our level of operational risk  and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities 
this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program 
our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls 
risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee  and independently supports the audit committee s oversight of these controls
