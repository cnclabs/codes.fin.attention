the corporation is subject to interest rate risk the corporation s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the corporation s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal open market committee 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the corporation receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the corporation s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the corporation s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the corporation s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the corporation s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned net interest income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s management of interest rate risk 
the corporation s allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient the corporation maintains an allowance for possible loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and 
table of contents unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the corporation s control  may require an increase in the allowance for possible loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
furthermore  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses  the corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for possible loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned allowance for possible loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
the corporation s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas the corporation s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which the corporation operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the corporation provides banking and financial services to customers across texas through financial centers in the austin  corpus christi  dallas  fort worth  houston  rio grande valley and san antonio regions 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the corporation s products and services as well as the ability of the corporation s customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the corporation s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions in texas  whether caused by recession  inflation  unemployment  changes in securities markets  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
the corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose the corporation to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  the corporation s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the corporation cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the corporation 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area the corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets where the corporation operates 
the corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
also  technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services 
table of contents traditionally provided by banks 
for example  consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
further  many of the corporation s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the corporation can 
the corporation s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the corporation s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which the corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors 
customer satisfaction with the corporation s level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the corporation s competitive position  which could adversely affect the corporation s growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision the corporation  primarily through cullen frost  frost bank and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
these regulations affect the corporation s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
other changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the corporation to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products the corporation may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operations
