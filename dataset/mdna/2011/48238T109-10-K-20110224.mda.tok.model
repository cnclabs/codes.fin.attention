certain initiatives that management considers important to our long term success include substantial capital investment in e business  information technology  facility relocations and expansions  as well as operating initiatives designed to enhance overall efficiencies  have significant risks associated with their execution  and could take several years to yield any direct monetary benefits 
accordingly  we cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful 
in addition  we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business 
overview we provide whole car and salvage auction services in north america 
our business is divided into three reportable business segments  each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry adesa auctions  iaai and afc 
the adesa auctions segment consisted primarily of a whole car auction network in north america at december  vehicles at adesa s auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators  financial institutions  rental car companies  used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers 
adesa also provides value added ancillary services including inspections  storage  transportation  reconditioning and titling and other administrative services 
the iaai segment consisted of salvage vehicle auctions and related services provided at sites in north america at december  the salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged or low value vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies and charity donation vehicles  as well as recovered stolen or theft vehicles 
the salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as transportation  titling  salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services 
the afc segment provides short term  inventory secured financing  known as floorplan financing  primarily to independent used vehicle dealers 
at december   afc conducted business through branches in north america 

table of contents the holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate office  such as salaries  benefits  and travel costs for our management team  certain human resources  information technology and accounting costs  and incremental insurance  treasury  legal and risk management costs 
holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on the corporate debt structure 
intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain information technology costs allocated by the holding company 
industry outlook and trends whole car during the period from to  despite fluctuations in economic conditions  new vehicle sales and churn ie  the rate of ownership transfer of vehicles in the used vehicle market  used vehicles sold in north america through whole car auctions remained within the relatively narrow range of approximately million to million used vehicles per year 
we estimate that the vehicle population in the united states has increased from million units in to in excess of million units in and therefore the used vehicle market  and hence the used vehicle auction industry  have an even larger inventory of potential transactions to draw from 
a larger vehicle population may partially offset any short term decreases in new vehicle sales  which we believe has resulted in vehicle auction volumes remaining fairly consistent over the last several years 
however  we estimate that whole car auction volume was approximately million to million units for the year ended december  we believe that  despite challenging conditions in the overall economy and the automotive industry in  and and the attendant fluctuations in new vehicle sales and churn  used vehicle auction volumes in north america in the foreseeable future will be within the range of approximately million to million used vehicles per year 
the decline in industry auction volumes in as compared to the period from to reflects a reduction in units sold by institutional consignors 
this decrease has been partially offset by an increase in dealer consignment units sold in as compared to salvage during the period from through  the north american salvage vehicle auction industry volumes increased 
vehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry 
as vehicles become more complex with additional enhancements  such as airbags and electrical components  they are more costly to repair following an accident and insurance companies are more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss 
the percentage of claims resulting in total losses steadily increased to over in and was slightly below in for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   we believe the salvage industry auction volumes were down slightly 
to the extent this trend continues or a decline in the salvage vehicle auction industry volumes occurs  it could have an adverse impact on iaai s results of operations 
automotive finance in and  the overall economy and in particular the automotive finance industries faced pressures which negatively affected the used vehicle dealer base 
in excess of  independent dealers went out of business during and  almost a reduction in the independent dealer base 
used vehicle dealers experienced a significant decline in sales which resulted in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans which increased credit losses 
in addition  the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans was impacted to some degree by the volatility in the vehicle pricing market 
to the extent these negative trends recur  they could have a material adverse impact on afc s results of operations 
despite the negative factors and trends impacting the automotive finance industry in and  afc s financial results improved in the second half of and throughout afc implemented a number of strategic initiatives in and early designed to tighten credit standards and reduce risk and exposure in 
table of contents its portfolio of finance receivables 
these initiatives have resulted in a substantial ongoing improvement in the aging of the managed portfolio  which was just under percent current at december  in addition  afc s managed portfolio of finance receivables grew approximately percent from december  to million at december  the average value of a vehicle on floorplan at afc has increased approximately from december  to december  general in and  significant changes occurred in the economy which impacted our business 
a lack of availability of consumer credit for retail used vehicle buyers  a decline in consumer spending  a reduction in the number of franchised and independent used vehicle dealers in the united states  reduced miles driven and decreases in commodity prices such as steel and platinum all negatively impacted us 
additionally  factors that influenced our business in included increases in used vehicle prices  supply constraints resulting from the decline in new vehicle sales during the recession  a decrease in the number of repossessions  lower loan default rates and fewer vehicles being classified as total loss vehicles by the insurance industry 
the availability of financing to franchised dealerships and consumers from the vehicle manufacturers captive finance companies and their respective remarketing programs may also impact the supply of vehicles to the wholesale auction industry in the future 
a change in the supply of used vehicles could impact the value of used vehicles sold  conversion rates calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale and adesa s profitability on the sale of vehicles 
in addition  we believe the reduced number of lease originations in and will negatively impact the supply of off lease vehicles available at auction in and seasonality the volume of vehicles sold at our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
this seasonality is caused by several factors including weather  the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers  the availability and quality of salvage vehicles  holidays  and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles  which affects the demand side of the auction industry 
used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions 
in addition  mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur  resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall 
as a result  revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis 
the fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather 
sources of revenues and expenses our revenue is derived from auction fees and related services at our whole car and salvage auction facilities and dealer financing fees and interest income at afc 
although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees  our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold 
prior to january   afc s net revenue consisted primarily of securitization income and interest and fee income less provisions for credit losses 
securitization income was primarily comprised of the gain on sale of finance receivables sold  but also included servicing income  discount accretion  and any change in the fair value of the retained interest in finance receivables sold 
accounting standards update amended asc  transfers and servicing  and we adopted the new guidance on january  as a result of adopting the guidance  our consolidated statement of income no longer reflects securitization income  but instead reports interest and fee income  provision for credit losses and other income associated with our securitized finance receivables  in the same line items in our statement of income as non securitized receivables 
interest expense associated with the related obligation is now recorded below operating profit as interest expense in our consolidated statement of income 
additionally  we no longer record a gain on sale for securitization activity 
table of contents since finance receivables securitized no longer receive gain on sale treatment 
the impact of the elimination of gain on sale treatment resulted in a reduction of pre tax income of approximately million in the first quarter of our operating expenses consist of cost of services  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs  subcontract services  supplies  insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices 
cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs  sales and marketing  information technology services and professional fees

income taxes our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  excluding the effect of the discrete items  our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and december  would have been and  respectively 
the change in the tax rate  excluding the effect of discrete items  was primarily attributable to the reduction of expenses permanently nondeductible for tax purposes  the increase in consolidated pre tax profits and lower tax rates in state and foreign jurisdictions 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in  which reflects the recognition of the impact of certain tax deductions which will not impact future periods 
as such  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately the statutory income tax rate in  not taking into consideration unknown future events

december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents restricted cash working capital amounts available under credit facility cash flow from operations there were related outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which reduce the amount available for borrowings under our credit facility 
working capital a substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services provided 
the majority of our working capital needs are short term in nature  usually less than a week in duration 
due to the decentralized nature of the business  payments for most vehicles purchased are received at each auction and branch 
most of the financial institutions place a temporary hold on the availability of the funds deposited that generally can range up to two business days  resulting in cash in our accounts and on our balance sheet that is unavailable for use until it is made available by the various financial institutions 
over the years  we have increased the amount of funds that are available for immediate use and are actively working on initiatives that will continue to decrease the time between the deposit of and the availability of funds received from customers 
there are outstanding checks book overdrafts to sellers and vendors included in current liabilities 
because a portion of these outstanding checks for operations in the us are drawn upon bank accounts at financial institutions other than the financial institutions that hold the cash  we cannot offset all the cash and the outstanding checks on our balance sheet

on october   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement 
as part of the amendment  we paid an amendment fee of basis points to approving lenders  based on commitments outstanding as of october   on the effective date of the amendment 
the amendment became effective with the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  including the consummation of our initial public offering and the prepayment of million or more of term loan b 
the amendment i allowed kar llc to own less than of our outstanding capital stock  ii permitted us to use proceeds from the initial public offering and any future offering of common stock plus unrestricted cash on hand at the time of the initial public offering to repay  redeem  repurchase or defease  or segregate funds with respect to  one or more of our senior subordinated notes  fixed senior notes and floating senior notes and iii permitted us to pay accelerated management fees to our equity sponsors in connection with the termination of our ongoing financial advisory fees with them

the revolving credit facility also provides for both base rate revolving borrowings and swingline borrowings at a rate of prime plus a margin of basis points 
term loan b bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus a margin of basis points 
our million revolving line of credit was undrawn as of december  there were related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million at december   which reduce the amount available for borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  our canadian operations have a c million line of credit  which was undrawn as of december   however  there were related letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately c million at december   which reduce credit available under the canadian line of credit  but do not affect amounts available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in accordance with terms of the credit agreement  of the net proceeds from the initial securitization of afc s canadian receivables were used to prepay million of term loan b in february in addition  as part of the november amendment to the credit agreement  we prepaid million of term loan b in the fourth quarter of using cash on hand 
there are no further scheduled quarterly installments due on term loan b and the remaining balance is due at maturity october  
on december    million was outstanding on term loan b 

table of contents the credit agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  a financial covenant requiring a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio be satisfied as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if revolving loans are outstanding  and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make acquisitions  consummate change of control transactions  dispose of assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make investments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
the leverage ratio covenant is based on consolidated adjusted ebitda which is ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude among other things a gains and losses from asset sales  b unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness  c certain non recurring gains and losses  d stock option expense  e certain other noncash amounts included in the determination of net income  f management  monitoring  consulting and advisory fees paid to the equity sponsors  g charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting  h unrealized gains and losses on hedge agreements  i minority interest  j expenses associated with the consolidation of salvage operations  k consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction  operating restructuring and business improvement efforts  l expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases  software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts  m expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions  and n any impairment charges or write offs of intangibles 
the covenants contained within the senior credit facility are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial liquidity  as the violation of these covenants could result in a default and lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
in addition  the indentures governing our notes contain certain financial and operational restrictions on paying dividends and other distributions  making certain acquisitions or investments  incurring indebtedness  granting liens and selling assets 
these covenants affect our operating flexibility by  among other things  restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business  as well as to fund general corporate purposes 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility at december  we believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand  working capital  cash provided by operating activities  and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our short and long term operating needs for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements and debt service payments for the next twelve months 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented herein  are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
they are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered substitutes for net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as substitutes for cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity 
ebitda is defined as net income loss  plus interest expense net of interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings  as described above in the discussion of certain restrictive loan covenants under credit facilities 
management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors 
in addition  management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate our performance and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under gaap 
these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

table of contents summary of cash flows year ended december  dollars in millions net cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow was primarily impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in net income 
the change in operating assets was driven by the reduction in retained interests in finance receivables sold and a reduction in finance receivables held for sale  which resulted from the adoption of accounting standards update asu the new guidance specifies that the finance receivable transactions on or subsequent to january  under our revolving sale agreement be included in our balance sheet 
net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of the net increase in finance receivables held for investment which resulted from the adoption of asu as discussed above 
in addition  there was an increase in cash spent on acquisitions and on capital expenditures in for a discussion of the company s capital expenditures  see capital expenditures below 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the million increase in obligations collateralized by finance receivables which resulted from the application of asu as discussed above 
the increase in obligations collateralized by finance receivables was partially offset by an increase in payments on long term debt  including payments for the early extinguishment of debt and related prepayment penalties totaling million 
in addition  in  we received net proceeds from our initial public offering of million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the years ended december  and approximated million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were funded primarily from internally generated funds 
we continue to invest in our core information technology capabilities and capacity expansion 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million for fiscal year anticipated expenditures are primarily attributable to ongoing information system projects  upkeep and improvements at existing vehicle auction facilities  improvements in information technology systems and infrastructure and expansion and relocation of existing auction sites that are at capacity 
future capital expenditures could vary substantially based on capital project timing and the initiation of new information systems projects to support our business strategies 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below sets forth a summary of our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of december  some of the figures included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we may actually pay in future periods could vary from those reflected in the table

off balance sheet arrangements and adoption of accounting standards update afc sells the majority of its us dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  consolidated  special purpose subsidiary afc funding corporation  established for the purpose of purchasing afc s finance receivables 
a securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by afc funding corporation to a bank conduit facility of undivided interests in certain eligible finance receivables subject to committed liquidity 
the agreement expires on april  afc funding corporation had fully utilized its committed liquidity of million from a third party conduit for us finance receivables at december  afc believes the current aggregate maximum commitment totaling million and available cash will be adequate to fund additional growth in its us finance receivables 
prior to the expiration of the securitization agreement  the company expects to pursue an amendment or new agreement to increase committed liquidity available under the securitization agreement 
we completed an agreement for the securitization of automotive finance canada  inc s afci receivables in february this securitization facility provides up to c million in financing for eligible finance receivables through another third party conduit 
the initial funding for securitization of canadian finance receivables resulted in net proceeds of million and the recording of the related obligations 
the agreement expires on april  
table of contents asu amended asc  transfers and servicing  and we adopted the new guidance on january  the new guidance specifies that the finance receivable transactions on or subsequent to january  under our revolving sale agreement be included in our balance sheet 
this resulted in an increase in assets and related obligations in obligations collateralized by finance receivables were million at december  in addition  the new guidance eliminated securitization income accounting and resulted in the recording of fee and interest income and interest expense for the finance receivable transactions under the revolving sale agreement 
the elimination of securitization income accounting resulted in a reduction of pre tax income of approximately million in the first quarter of at december   afc managed total finance receivables of million 
at december   afc managed total finance receivables of million  of which million had been sold without recourse to afc funding corporation 
undivided interests in finance receivables were sold by afc funding corporation to the bank conduit facility with recourse totaling million at december  finance receivables include million classified as held for sale  which are recorded at lower of cost or fair value  and million classified as held for investment at december  finance receivables classified as held for investment include million related to receivables that were sold to the bank conduit facility that were repurchased by afc at fair value when they became ineligible under the terms of the collateral agreement with the bank conduit facility at december  the face amount of these receivables was million at december  afc s allowance for losses of million and million at december  and december   respectively  includes an estimate of losses for finance receivables held for investment as well as an allowance for any further deterioration in the finance receivables after they are repurchased from the bank conduit facility 
additionally  accrued liabilities of million for the estimated losses for loans sold by the special purpose subsidiary were recorded at december  these loans were sold to a bank conduit facility with recourse to the special purpose subsidiary and came back on the balance sheet of the special purpose subsidiary at fair value when they became ineligible under the terms of the collateral arrangement with the bank conduit facility 
as of december   the outstanding receivables sold  the retained interests in finance receivables sold and a cash reserve of percent of total sold receivables serve as security for the receivables that have been sold to the bank conduit facility 
as of december   million of finance receivables and a cash reserve of percent of finance receivables securitized serve as security for the million of obligations collateralized by finance receivables 
the amount of the cash reserve depends on circumstances which are set forth in the securitization agreements 
after the occurrence of a termination event  as defined in the us securitization agreement  the bank conduit facility may  and could  cause the stock of afc funding corporation to be transferred to the bank conduit facility  though as a practical matter the bank conduit facility would look to the liquidation of the receivables under the transaction documents as their primary remedy 
proceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank conduit facility are used to fund new loans to customers 
afc  afc funding corporation and afci must maintain certain financial covenants including  among others  limits on the amount of debt afc and afci can incur  minimum levels of tangible net worth  and other covenants tied to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio 
the securitization agreements also incorporate the financial covenants of our credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in the securitization agreement 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting measurements that management believes are most critical to the reported results of our operations and financial condition include uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts  goodwill and long lived assets  self insurance programs  legal proceedings and other loss contingencies and income taxes 

table of contents in addition to the critical accounting estimates  there are other items used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in cases where management estimates are used  they are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
in addition  our most significant accounting policies are discussed in note and elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in this annual report on form k 
uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts are based on management s evaluation of the receivables portfolio under current economic conditions  the volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio credit quality  review of specific collection matters and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition in estimating losses 
specific collection matters can be impacted by the outcome of negotiations  litigation and bankruptcy proceedings 
due to the nature of our business  substantially all trade receivables are due from vehicle dealers  salvage buyers  institutional customers and insurance companies 
we generally have possession of vehicles or vehicle titles collateralizing a significant portion of these receivables 
at the auction sites  risk is mitigated through a pre auction registration process that includes verification of identification  bank accounts  dealer license status  acceptable credit history  buying history at other auctions and the written acceptance of all of the auction s policies and procedures 
afc s allowance for credit losses includes an estimate of losses for finance receivables held for investment  as well as an allowance for any further deterioration in the finance receivables after they are repurchased from the bank conduit facility 
additionally  prior to  an accrued liability was recorded for the estimated losses for loans sold by afc s subsidiary  afc funding corporation 
these loans were sold to a bank conduit facility with recourse to afc funding corporation and came back on the balance sheet of afc funding corporation at fair value when they became ineligible under the terms of the collateral arrangement with the bank conduit facility 
afc controls credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits  underwriting and collateral management monitoring procedures  which includes holding vehicle titles where permitted 
goodwill and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may be impaired 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market valuation relative to our book value 
in assessing goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding 
table of contents estimated future cash flows and earnings  changes in our business strategy and economic conditions affecting market valuations related to the fair values of our three reporting units which consist of our three operating and reportable business segments adesa auctions  iaai and afc 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with asc  business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the total amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that asset  we would recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for recovery is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows 
our impairment analysis is based on the current business strategy  expected growth rates and estimated future economic conditions 
self insurance programs we self insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program  as well as a portion of our automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
we have insurance coverage that limits the exposure on individual claims 
we also have insurance coverage that limits the total exposure to overall automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
the cost of the insurance is expensed over the contract periods 
we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits  automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims 
trends in healthcare costs could have a significant impact on anticipated claims 
if actual claims are higher than anticipated  our accrual might be insufficient to cover the claims costs  which would have an adverse impact on the operating results in that period 
legal proceedings and other loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various legal proceedings and other loss contingencies  many involving litigation incidental to the business and a variety of environmental laws and regulations 
litigation and other loss contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes of such matters are often very difficult to predict and generally are resolved over long periods of time 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often are dependent on the judgment about potential actions by third parties 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or otherwise disclosed  in accordance with asc  contingencies 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted 
if the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued  this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
legal fees are expensed as incurred 

table of contents income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
we record our tax provision based on existing laws  experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current irs or other taxing authority examinations and management s understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we establish reserves when we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged by a taxing authority 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance accounting standards update on the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the new guidance  which amends asc  receivables  requires further disaggregated disclosures that improve financial statement users understanding of the nature of an entity s credit risk associated with its financing receivables and the entity s assessment of that risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses as well as changes in the allowance and the reasons for those changes 
the new guidance is generally effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december   however  certain aspects of the guidance pertaining to activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  as asu only applies to financial statement disclosures  the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued new guidance accounting standards update on fair value measurements 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires disclosure of details of significant transfers in and out of level and level measurements and reasons for the transfers 
in addition  a gross presentation of activity within the level roll forward  presenting separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements is required 
the new guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december   with the exception for the gross presentation of the level roll forward  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance accounting standards update on the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  transfers and servicing  eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after november  this new guidance requires inclusion of loans sold to a bank conduit facility as well as the related obligation originated after december   in our financial statements 
we adopted the guidance on january  this resulted in an increase in assets and 
table of contents related obligations in obligations collateralized by finance receivables were million at december  in addition  the new guidance eliminated securitization income accounting and resulted in the recording of fee and interest income and interest expense for the finance receivable transactions under the revolving sale agreement 
the elimination of securitization income accounting resulted in a reduction of pre tax income of approximately million in the first quarter of in october  the fasb issued new guidance accounting standards update on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance which amends asc  revenue recognition  addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
in addition  asu significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu on the consolidated financial statements  however  the company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our foreign currency exposure is limited and arises from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  particularly intercompany loans  as well as from translation of the results of operations from our canadian and  to a much lesser extent  mexican subsidiaries 
however  fluctuations between us and us currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non us subsidiaries 
to the extent such repatriation is necessary for us to meet our debt service or other obligations  these tax inefficiencies may adversely affect us 
we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge changes in the canadian or mexican exchange rates 
canadian currency translation positively affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  canadian currency translation negatively affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  currency exposure of our mexican operations is not material to the results of operations 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings 
accordingly  interest rate fluctuations affect the amount of interest expense we are obligated to pay 
we use interest rate derivative agreements to manage the variability of cash flows to be paid due to interest rate movements on our variable rate debt 
we have designated our interest rate derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the earnings impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded upon the recognition of the interest related to the hedged debt 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is recognized in current earnings 
there was no significant ineffectiveness in the years ended december  or in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate term loan b credit facility 
the interest rate swap agreement had an effective date of june   matures on june  and effectively results in a fixed libor interest rate of on million of the term loan b credit facility 
in may  we also purchased an interest rate cap for million with a notional amount of million to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate term loan b credit facility when one month libor exceeds 
the interest rate cap relates to a portion of the variable rate debt that is not covered by an interest rate swap agreement 
the interest rate cap agreement had an effective date of june  and matures on june  
table of contents the fair values of the interest rate derivatives are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from a commercial bank 
at december  and december   respectively  the fair value of the interest rate swap was a million unrealized loss and an million unrealized loss recorded in other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  at december  and december   respectively  the fair value of the interest rate cap was a less than million asset and a million asset recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate derivatives are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   there was a net unrealized loss totaling million  net of tax benefits of million 
at december   there was a net unrealized loss totaling million  net of tax benefits of million 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties  however  non performance is not anticipated 
we have only partially hedged our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt 
a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our variable rate debt instruments to a hypothetical basis point increase in short term rates for the years ended december  and would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively
