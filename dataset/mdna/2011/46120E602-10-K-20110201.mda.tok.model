we design  manufacture and market da vinci surgical systems  which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery 
we believe that this new generation of surgery  which we call da vinci surgery  is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery open surgery and minimally invasive surgery  or conventional mis 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  or consoles  a patient side cart and a high performance vision system 
the da vinci surgical system translates the surgeon s natural hand movements  which are performed on instrument controls at a console  into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system provides the surgeon with intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition d vision  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to deliver higher value minimally invasive surgical procedures to their patients 
we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy invasiveness 
here procedure efficacy is a 
table of contents measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself 
when the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options  we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci procedures  potentially driving a disruptive change in the marketplace and can lead to the broad adoption of robotic surgery 
these adoptions occur procedure by procedure  and are driven by the relative patient value of da vinci procedures against alternatives for the same disease state 
business model 
in our business model  we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  derived from sales of instruments  accessories and service 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for between million and million  depending on configuration and geography  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we then generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our endowrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery  at which point they are replaced 
we also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  typically at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending on the configuration of the underlying system 
recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue 
recurring revenue increased from million  or of total revenue in  to million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in the increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems 
we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained the necessary clearances to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
as we make additions to target procedures  we will continue to seek the necessary clearances 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures december transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures during first quarter of  we received clearances to market our da vinci si surgical system in the united states and europe 
in november  we received regulatory shonin approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor  and welfare mhlw for our da vinci s system in japan 
during the year ended december   we sold da vinci s systems in japan 
these sales were primarily made to early adopters 
we are currently focusing our 
table of contents efforts with johnson johnson kk medical company japan on obtaining specific reimbursement approvals for da vinci procedures in japan 
if we are not successful in obtaining system wide single procedure reimbursements or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures  then the demand of our products could be limited 
we have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from johnson johnson kk medical company japan in our japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to meet government requirements 
we have partnered with adachi co  ltd as our separate independent distribution partner in japan who is responsible for marketing  selling  and servicing our products in japan 
business events and trends economic environment 
during the first half of  the world wide economic recession curtailed capital purchases of our da vinci surgical systems 
the total da vinci surgical systems sold in the year ended december  exceeded those sold during the same period of by systems 
da vinci si surgical system product launch 
during the second quarter of we launched our newest da vinci model  the da vinci si 
the da vinci si brings to market three significant innovations 
first  our insite imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease of use 
the hd imaging system s increased performance is similar to the move from p to i in commercial television 
we believe that the increased visual performance will continue to enhance surgeon precision and confidence and may contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times 
secondly  the da vinci si surgeon console s user interface was redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da vinci products and other operating room devices  such as electro surgical units 
the new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort 
we believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training 
the third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeon s console for use during surgery  which will allow new methods of training da vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da vinci surgery 
with the da vinci si  a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da vinci arms during a case 
we believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases 
the da vinci si surgical system was fda approved and ce marked upon launch and is currently available in most countries other than japan 
da vinci si systems are available with an option to purchase a second console 
existing da vinci s instruments and most da vinci s accessories  excluding endoscopes and drapes  are compatible with the da vinci si system 
we will continue to sell  service and support the da vinci s surgical system 
our sales of the standard da vinci surgical system have substantially ended  however  we continue to service and support this product line 
most customers who purchased da vinci s surgical systems in the first quarter of were offered the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da vinci s surgical systems to da vinci si surgical systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade 
the upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da vinci s camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da vinci si camera or other accessories 
these customers were given until june  to accept our offer 
total revenue in an amount equal to the discount  of approximately million  was deferred in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we recognized million of revenue from offers declined  upgrades completed or accessories delivered 
in the third quarter of  we completed all accepted da vinci si system upgrade offers and recognized the remaining million of deferred revenue 
the deferral and subsequent recognition did not impact the comparability of the results for the year ended to any other year 
market acceptance of the da vinci si surgical system has been positive since its market introduction in the second quarter of in the year ended december   out of systems sold were da vinci si surgical systems  representing approximately of system sales 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we introduced the new si e model of the da vinci surgical system 
the arm si e system is designed to deliver core da vinci functionality  providing a flexible  capable and economical solution for many robotic assisted procedures 
the da vinci si e system is fully upgradeable to the da vinci si model by adding a fourth arm third instrument arm  and other enhancements 
during the year ended december   we sold da vinci si e systems 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the da vinci skills simulator 
the simulator is a practice tool which will begin shipping in early for the da vinci si surgical system that gives a user the opportunity to practice his or her facility with the surgeon console controls 
the simulator incorporates three dimensional  physics based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment 
the user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console 
the suite of exercises includes novice  intermediate  and advanced levels 
upon completion of a skills exercise  the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task specific metrics 
the skills simulator is intended to augment  not replace  existing training programs for the da vinci si surgical system 
financial highlights total revenue increased to  million  or  during the year ended december  from  million during the year ended december  approximately  da vinci procedures were performed during the year ended december   up approximately from last year

operating income increased to million  or during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  operating income included million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock programs 
we ended fiscal with  million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased by million during driven by cash flow from operations and million generated from employee stock programs  partially offset by million used to repurchase and retire million shares of common stock  and million used for capital expenditure and the purchase of intellectual property 
procedure adoption we believe the adoption of da vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure  and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer greater patient value than non da vinci alternatives 
we believe the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes  less surgical trauma  or both 

table of contents an increasing body of peer review literature has indicated that dvp offers improved functional outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy with less surgical and post surgical morbidity 
favorable clinical outcomes have also been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology  which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion 
for most patients  a minimally invasive approach using the da vinci surgical system offers reduced pain  less blood loss  shorter hospital stays  reduced post operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities when compared to open surgery 
in  approximately  surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system  up approximately compared to the growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by da vinci hysterectomy dvh in the us  da vinci prostatectomy dvp outside the us and pull through procedures in the urology and gynecology categories nephrectomy partial and full  sacralcolpopexy  myomectomy  cystectomy  pyeloplasty in the us during  dvh became our highest volume procedure  surpassing dvp 
dvh procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  cases in  of which approximately  were for the treatment of cancer and the remaining  related to benign conditions 
the very large majority of our dvh volume came from the us market  where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately  to  cases  of which about  are for cancer 
dvp procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  cases worldwide  in the large majority of the approximately  prostatectomies performed each year in the us are done robotically with the da vinci 
us dvp volume was essentially flat  with the majority of our worldwide dvp growth coming from european markets 
other procedures non dvh dvp grew over in to approximately  cases 
growth in these other da vinci procedures is comprised of pull through procedures such as da vinci partial nephrectomy in urology and da vinci sacralcopopexy in gynecology as well as other procedures  which we term emerging procedures 
emerging procedures are earlier in their development  such as da vinci transoral robotic surgery tors in head and neck surgery 
while early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value  their growth is off of a small absolute base and their future growth rates are uncertain 
technology acquisitions we continue to make several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies 
total investments in intellectual property and related technologies during the year ended december  were million  compared to during the year ended december  amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
building acquisition during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement to purchase acres of land and buildings for million in sunnyvale  california by june this property is in close proximity to our existing headquarters 
although we entered into the agreement to support the potential growth of our business there is no guarantee that the planned growth and expansion will take place in the timeframe we expected  or at all

total revenue increased to  million during the year ended december  from  million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da vinci surgery 
we believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure  driving higher system and recurring revenue 
our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects penetration in our target procedures 
dvh and dvp are our two largest procedures  representing more than of our total procedures over the past several years 
revenue within the united states accounted for   and of total revenue during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment in the us

procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dvh and dvp being the largest drivers of growth 
utilization per installed system for the year ended december  also increased as compared with the year ended december  instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from to systems revenue increased to million during the year ended december   up from million during the year ended december  primarily due to more systems sold in we sold da vinci surgical systems during the year ended december   compared with in the year ended december  of the systems sold during the year ended december  were the da vinci si surgical systems  of which systems were dual console configurations 
we had da vinci standard and da vinci s surgical systems traded in during the year ended december   compared with standard systems traded in during the year ended december  all of the da vinci s trade ins occurred during the fourth quarter 
prior to the fourth quarter  transactions involving customers transitioning from da vinci s to a da vinci si system were included in upgrade revenue and excluded from the system count 
the fourth quarter treatment reflects the current nature of the higher priced transactions where customers are now shipped completely new da vinci si systems in exchange for their used da vinci ss  rather than receiving component level field upgrades of their da vinci s units 
the average selling price asp of million was higher than the asp of million  resulting from a higher percentage of the higher priced single and dual console da vinci si surgical systems in the systems product mix

procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dvh and dvp being the largest drivers of growth 
utilization per installed system for the year ended december  also increased as compared with the year ended december  instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from to instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined approximately during primarily due to the impact of initial stocking orders 
the amount of revenue related to stocking orders is less impactful as the base of installed systems grows 
in addition  we believe our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase 
we expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the future
