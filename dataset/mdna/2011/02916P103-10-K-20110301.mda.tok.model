item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements  including as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
see special note regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this report and risk factors set forth in item a of this report 
overview we are a leading north american designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars 
we also lease  repair and refurbish railcars  provide fleet management services and design and manufacture certain railcar and industrial components 
we provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services 
we operate in two segments manufacturing operations and railcar services 
manufacturing operations consist of railcar manufacturing  railcar leasing and railcar and industrial component manufacturing 
railcar services consist of railcar repair and refurbishment services and fleet management services 
the north american railcar market has been  and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical 
the recent economic downturn and restricted credit markets have seen modest improvements but had a negative effect on the railcar manufacturing market in which we compete  resulting in increased competition and significant pricing pressures in this downturn adversely affected the sales of our railcars and other products and caused us to slow our production rates in as compared to  resulting in a significant decrease in comparable shipments and revenues 
for the year ended december  we reported a net loss 
throughout  railcar loadings have increased and the number of railcars in storage has decreased  as reported by an independent third party industry analyst 
along with these improvements  which may or may not continue  we have received an increased number of requests for quotations and were successful in securing approximately  railcar orders in we believe that these improvements appear to indicate that the railcar market has begun and will continue to improve and based in part on these factors  we currently expect our railcar orders and shipments to increase in  as compared to we cannot assure you that the railcar market will continue to improve or that our railcar orders and shipments will increase 
our railcar services segment experienced growth due to increased volumes at railcar repair plants and railcar repair projects completed at our railcar manufacturing facilities 
these higher volumes along with our seasoned workforce have generated additional efficiencies in completing repair projects 
we plan to continue to utilize available capacity at these facilities for certain repair projects in

selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses increased in to million from million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to a million increase in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation  outside services and a non recurring legal settlement recorded in the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to increased expense related to our stock appreciation rights sars  which was driven by an increase in the stock price in as compared to interest expense and interest income net interest expense for was million  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense  as compared to million of net interest expense for  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense 
the million decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to the higher interest rate that was earned on corporate bonds purchased and sold in  as the sale proceeds were reinvested at a lower rate of return 
the million increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest caused by a decrease in capital expenditures

gross profit our gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross profit margin increased to in from in the increase in overall gross profit margin was primarily driven by an increase in railcar services and effective cost management  all partially offset by a decrease in railcar shipments 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations remained constant at for both and this was primarily attributable to fixed overhead cost control measures and strong labor efficiencies at most of our manufacturing locations offset by lower volumes 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to labor efficiencies  increased volume and a favorable mix of work 
selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses decreased in to million from million in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to decreased workforce and other cost cutting measures partially offset by a legal settlement and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to increased expense for sars  which was driven by a trend of increasing stock price levels in as compared to a trend of decreasing stock price levels in interest expense and interest income net interest expense for was million  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense  as compared to million of net interest expense for  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had net working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
our cash position at december  consists of cash proceeds from our unsecured senior notes issued in february  net cash proceeds from our short term investment activity and overall cash used in operations 
outstanding and available debt unsecured senior notes in february  we issued million of unsecured senior fixed rate notes  which were subsequently exchanged for registered notes in march notes 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the terms of the notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt  issue disqualified or preferred stock  make certain restricted payments and enter into certain significant transactions with stockholders and affiliates 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined and as measured on a rolling four quarter basis  is less than to and based on this ratio  certain of these covenants  including our ability to incur additional debt  have become further restricted 
as of december   and for the year then ended  we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the notes 
commencing on march   the redemption price is set at of the principal amount of our unsecured senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  and declines annually until it is reduced to of the principal amount of our unsecured senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from and after march  our unsecured senior notes are due in full plus accrued unpaid interest on march  cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our accounts receivables  processing of payroll and associated taxes and payments to our suppliers 
our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
our net loss of million was impacted by non cash items including depreciation and amortization expense of million  joint venture losses of million  stock based compensation of million relating to sars that settle in cash and other smaller items 
cash used in operating activities included an increase of million of accounts receivable including those from affiliates  an increase of million of inventory and an increase of million of income taxes receivable 
cash provided by operating activities included an increase of million in accounts payable including those to affiliates  an increase in accrued expenses and taxes of million  a decrease of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease of million in interest receivable  due from affiliates 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventory was primarily due to increased sales and production levels in december as compared to december the increase in income taxes receivable was primarily due to our net loss of million 
the increase in accrued expenses and taxes was primarily due to an increase in accrued stock based compensation relating to sars that settle in cash at december  compared to december  the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to an increase in production and inventory levels and the timing of payments in compared to the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to a decrease in advances to the workers compensation insurance carrier and the timing of corporate insurance payments in as compared to the decrease in interest receivable is primarily attributable to the sale of corporate bonds in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this amount includes million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  million of equity contributions and loans to our ohio castings  axis  amtek railcar and usrc joint ventures  partially offset by a million cash inflow from the sale of short term investments 
the million in capital expenditures was primarily for the purchase of equipment at multiple locations and for projects to improve operating efficiencies and maintenance activities 
some of these purchases are described in further detail below under capital expenditures 

table of contents capital expenditures we continuously evaluate facility requirements based on our strategic plans  production requirements and market demand and may elect to change our level of capital investments in the future 
these investments are all based on an analysis of the estimated rates of return and impact on our profitability 
we could pursue opportunities to reduce our costs through vertical integration of component parts 
from time to time  we may expand our business  domestically or abroad  by acquiring other businesses or pursuing other strategic growth opportunities including  without limitation  joint ventures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including costs that were capitalized related to refurbishment and replacement of existing assets and facilities  improvements for cost reduction purposes and expansion activities at our railcar repair facilities that were completed during future liquidity we believe that our existing cash balance of million will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our expected operating requirements over the next twelve months 
we expect our future cash flows from operations to be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the overall economy  the number of our railcar orders and shipments and our production rates 
our future liquidity may also be impacted by the number of our new railcar orders leased versus sold 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our indenture and any other indebtedness we may enter into  and our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by other matters discussed under risk factors  and trends and uncertainties discussed in this discussion and analysis  as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect our long term liquidity 
our current capital expenditure plans for include projects that we expect will maintain equipment  improve efficiencies and reduce costs and various capital expenditures related to projects that have carried over into these capital expenditure plans may also include expenditures to further integrate our supply chain 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete any of our projects on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
other potential projects  including possible strategic transactions that could complement and expand our business units  will be evaluated to determine if the project or opportunity is right for us 
we anticipate that any future expansion of our business will be financed through existing resources  cash flow from operations  term debt associated directly with that project or other new financing 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet existing financial covenants or obtain term debt or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 
dividends during each quarter since our initial public offering in january until the second quarter of  our board of directors declared cash dividends of per share of our common stock to stockholders of record as of a given date 
the last dividend was declared in may and paid in july subsequently  in august  our board of directors indefinitely suspended our quarterly dividend payments and any decision to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results  strategic plans  capital improvements  financial condition  debt covenants and other factors  including provisions of our indenture 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations senior unsecured notes interest payments on senior unsecured notes pension and postretirement funding total the operating lease commitment includes the future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases for property and equipment leased by us 
as of december   we were not party to any enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
on february   we issued million of unsecured senior notes that are due on march  the interest rate on these notes is 
these notes have interest payments due semiannually on march and september of every year 
our pension funding commitments include minimum funding contributions required by law for our two funded pension plans as well as expected benefit payments for our one unfunded pension plan 
our postretirement benefits are also unfunded thus the participants and we must fund premium payments 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table above  our gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million 
while it is uncertain as to the amount  if any  of these unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled by means of a cash payment  we do not currently expect any significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in july  we entered into an agreement with axis to purchase new railcar axles 
we do not have any minimum volume purchase requirements under this agreement 
contingencies in connection with our investment in ohio castings  we have guaranteed a million state loan that provides for purchases of capital equipment  of which million was outstanding as of december  the state loan is scheduled to be fully paid off in june the two other partners of ohio castings have made identical guarantees of this obligation 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities  and negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
certain real property we acquired from acf in has been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination 
acf is an affiliate of mr 
carl icahn  the chairman of our board of directors and  through ielp  our principal beneficial stockholder 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of this property prior to its transfer to us by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
as of the date of this report  we do not believe that we will incur material costs in connection with any investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties  but we cannot assure that this will be the case 
if acf fails to honor its obligations to us  we could be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

table of contents we were named the defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit  nicole lerma v 
american railcar industries  inc  filed on august  in the circuit court of greene county  arkansas civil division 
the court reached a verdict in our favor on may  the plaintiff did not appeal the decision within the timeframe allowed 
we are from time to time party to various other legal proceedings arising out of our business 
such proceedings  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we believe that there are no proceedings pending against us that if the outcome was unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
axis loan axis entered into a credit agreement in december as amended  the axis credit agreement 
during  we  through ari component and the other initial partner acquired this loan from the lenders party thereto  with each party acquiring a interest in the loan for million  the then outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan we acquired 
the total commitment under the term loan is million with an additional million commitment under the revolving loan 
ari component is responsible to fund of the loan commitments 
the balance outstanding on these loans  due to ari component  was million of principal and million of accrued interest  both as of december  ari component s share of the remaining commitment on these loans was million as of december  see note for further information regarding this transaction and the terms of the underlying loan 
we are in discussions with axis and the other initial partner of axis regarding the potential renegotiation of the term loans  as it is not currently anticipated that axis will be able to repay the term loans in accordance with the axis credit agreement  beginning march  we cannot guarantee that any renegotiation will be accomplished on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  or in a timely manner 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
a summary of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of these policies involve a high degree of judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies  in management s judgment  are those described below 
if different assumptions or conditions prevail  or if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results could be materially different from those reported 
revenue recognition revenues from railcar sales are recognized following completion of manufacturing  inspection  customer acceptance and title transfer  which is when the risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer 
paint and lining work may be outsourced to an independent contractor and  as a result  the sale for the railcar may be recorded after customer acceptance when it leaves the manufacturing plant and the sale for the lining work may be separately recorded following completion of that work by the contractor  customer acceptance and final shipment 
revenues from railcar leasing are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
revenues from railcar and industrial components are recorded at the time of product shipment  in accordance with our contractual terms 
revenue for railcar maintenance services is recognized upon completion and shipment of railcars from our plants 
revenue for fleet management services is recognized as performed 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of our production facilities 
if any of our production facilities are not operating at normal capacity  unallocated production overheads are recognized as a current period charge 
we evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case  the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during the year ended december   no triggering events occurred 
the criteria for determining impairment of such long lived assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long lived assets 
if the long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the estimated fair value of the long lived assets is measured by estimating the present value of the future discounted cash flows to be generated 
the north american railcar market has been  and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical  generally fluctuating in correlation with the us economy 
while the economy and the railcar market remained weak throughout  we believe that this downturn is temporary  reflecting the cyclical nature of the industry  and that railcar orders will recover in the future 
independent third party industry analysts are also forecasting the railcar market to recover as the economy improves 
as a result  at this time  we do not believe that the decline in our shipments and revenues  which we view as temporary  warrants an impairment analysis of our long lived assets 
therefore  an impairment analysis was not performed for the year ended december  however  we intend to continue to monitor our long lived assets for impairment in response to events or changes in circumstances 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with a past business acquisition  all allocated to a reporting unit that is part of our manufacturing operations segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
whether an impairment of goodwill is required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value  which is determined using a combination of methods  including management s best estimate of future discounted cash flows expected to result from the business 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired and the impairment recognized equals such difference 
we performed the annual impairment test as of march   noting no adjustment was required 
we utilized the market and income approaches and significant assumptions  discussed below  in the march  impairment test 
market approach the market approach produces indications of value by applying multiples of enterprise value to revenue as well as enterprise value to earnings before depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes 
the multiples indicate what investors are willing to pay for comparable publicly held companies 
when adjusted for the risk level and growth potential of the subject company relative to the guideline companies  these multiples are a reasonable indication of the value an investor would attribute to the subject company 
income approach the income approach considers the subject company s future sales and earnings growth potential as the primary source of future cash flow 
we prepared a five year financial projection for the reporting unit and used a discounted net cash flow method to determine the fair value 
net cash flow consists of after tax operating income  plus depreciation  less capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the discounted cash flow method considers a five year projection of net cash flow and adds to those cash flows a residual value at the end of the projection period 
significant estimates and assumptions used in the evaluation were forecasted revenues and profits  the weighted average cost of capital and tax rates 
forecasted revenues of the reporting unit were estimated based on historical trends of our plants that the reporting unit supplies parts to  which are driven by the railcar market forecast 
forecasted margins were based on historical experience 
the reporting unit does not have a selling  administrative or executive staff  therefore  an estimate of salaries and benefits for key employees was added to selling  administrative and other costs 
the weighted average cost of capital was calculated using our estimated cost of equity and debt 

table of contents all of the above estimates and assumptions were determined by management to be reasonable based on the knowledge and information at the time of the evaluation 
as such  this carries a risk of uncertainty 
there could be significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  unionization of our workforce or other factors that might significantly affect the reporting unit s cost structure and negatively impact the projection of financial performance 
if the railcar industry forecasts or our market share were to change significantly  the fair value of the reporting unit would be materially adversely impacted 
other events that might occur that could have a negative effect would be a natural disaster that would render the facility unusable  a significant litigation settlement  a significant workers compensation claim or other event that would result in a production shut down or significant expense to the reporting unit 
the march  evaluation equally weighted the values derived from each approach to arrive at the fair value of the reporting unit 
the resulting fair value exceeded the carrying value by over resulting in no impairment 
product warranties we record a liability for an estimate of costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranty when manufacturing revenue is recognized 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of up to five years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our warranty liability based on changes in these factors 
actual results differing from estimates could have a material effect on results from operations in the event that unforeseen warranty issues were to occur 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense or benefit is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different from that taken by us  differences in a tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
any such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the consolidated financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate for recoverability our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax liabilities net of million of deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have established a valuation allowance of million for one deferred tax asset that is set to expire in for all other deferred tax assets  we consider it more likely than not that we will have taxable income in the future that will allow us to realize our deferred tax assets  and there are no other valuation allowances recorded at this time 
it is possible that some or all of our deferred tax assets could ultimately expire unused 
as of december   we had million in current income taxes receivable and million in long term income taxes receivable 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected investment return on plan assets  mortality rates and retirement rates  as discussed below discount rates the discount rate assumptions used to determine the december  benefit obligations and the expense amounts were for our pension plans and for our postretirement benefit plans 
we review these rates annually and adjust them to reflect current conditions 
we deemed these rates appropriate based on the citigroup pension discount curve analysis along with expected payments to retirees 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets for our funded pension plans of for is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumptions are primarily long term  prospective rates of return 

table of contents mortality and retirement rates mortality and retirement rates are based on actual and anticipated plan experience 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans effect on december  effect on pre tax projected change in assumption pension expense benefit obligation in thousands decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected return on assets n a increase in expected return on assets n a the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our postretirement benefit plan effect on pre tax effect on december  postretirement service projected change in assumption cost and interest cost benefit obligation in thousands decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate this sensitivity analysis reflects the effects of changing one assumption 
various economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
environmental certain real property we acquired from acf in has been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination 
acf is an affiliate of mr 
carl icahn  the chairman of our board of directors and  through ielp  our principal beneficial stockholder 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of this property prior to its transfer to us by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
as of the date of this report  we do not believe that we will incur material costs in connection with any investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties  but we cannot assure that this will be the case 
if acf fails to honor its obligations to us  we could be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
further  we cannot assure that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings  or that we will be able to recover under our indemnity provisions if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  or that such costs would not be material to us 
stock based compensation our share based awards have included stock options  sars and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our equity instrument awards and other share based awards issued under the equity incentive plan 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the equity award  future volatility  dividend yield  forfeiture rate and the risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected term of sars based on sec staff accounting bulletins official text topic d  which addressed the expected term aspect of the black scholes model 
it stated that companies that did not have adequate exercise history on equity instruments were allowed to use the simplified method prescribed by the sec  which called for an average of the vesting period and the expiration period of grants with plain vanilla characteristics 
these characteristics included service based vesting  instruments granted at the money along with certain other requirements 

table of contents both our stock options and sars have fair value estimates that are generated from the black scholes calculation 
this calculation requires inputs as mentioned above that may require some judgment or estimation 
we use our best judgment at the time of the grant to estimate fair value on the stock options to record the expense of those options over the vesting period of those options 
all sars granted are classified as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  given that they settle in cash  and thus  must be revalued every period 
as such  the fair value estimates on the sars we granted to our employees are subject to volatility inherent in the stock price since it is based on current market values at the end of every period 
stock based compensation on all equity awards is expensed using a graded vesting method over the vesting period of the instrument 
as of december   all compensation costs related to stock options and restricted stock have been recognized 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested portion of outstanding sars were approximately million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately months 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  amounts due to from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is determined by the market close price 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements for variable interest entities vie 
the new guidance requires on going assessments to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie and amends the primary beneficiary assessment and disclosure requirements 
this guidance was effective for the first interim and annual reporting period that begins after november  this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially steel and heavy castings 
the cost of steel  heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents more than half of our direct manufacturing costs per railcar 
given the significant volatility in the price of raw materials  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we believe that the risk to our margins and profitability has been somewhat reduced by the variable pricing provisions in place with certain of our current railcar manufacturing contracts 
these contracts adjust the purchase prices of our railcars to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of certain raw materials and components and  as a result  we are able to pass on to certain of our customers any increased raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars we plan to produce and deliver to them during we believe that we currently have excellent supplier relationships and do not currently anticipate that material constraints will limit our production capacity 
such constraints may exist if railcar production was to increase beyond current levels  or other economic changes were to occur that affect the availability of our raw materials
