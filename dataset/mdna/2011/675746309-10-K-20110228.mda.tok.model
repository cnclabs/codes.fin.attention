the following discussion of our results of operations  financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview operations summary the homeq acquisition and related shutdown costs in and the altisource separation and related income taxes in have significantly impacted our consolidated operating results 
the operating results of the homeq servicing business are included in the servicing segment since the acquisition on september  as a result of the separation on august   ocwen ceased  beginning on that date  to record operating results from the mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments 
the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years indicated 
we have provided a more complete discussion of operating results by line of business in the segments section

versus residential servicing fees were higher than as a result of fees from hamp modifications and the effects of billion of upb additions to the servicing portfolio including approximately billion on september  related to the homeq acquisition and billion added by the saxon acquisition in the second quarter 
however  process management fees and other revenues declined as a result of the separation 
operating expenses increased slightly in despite the separation because of non recurring expenses of  associated with the homeq acquisition and because of litigation expense of  incur red in connection with the cartel verdict and the proposed settlement of the mdl proceeding 
income from operations declined by  or  in as compared to other expense  net increased due to higher interest expense on borrowings related to the homeq acquisition of  and realized losses on sales of our remaining auction rate securities of  other expense  net also includes a  write off of a commercial real estate investment 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by gains of  from the sale of our general partnership interests in three affordable housing projects during the fourth quarter

net income attributable to ocwen increased by  as compared to versus our residential servicing revenues declined from due to lower annual average upb and fewer total completed loan modifications due in large part to the delays associated with the implementation of the hamp 
process management fees and other revenues declined because of the separation 
operating expenses declined in in part because of the separation 
in addition  servicing operating expenses for benefited from lower amortization expense on a smaller msr portfolio  reduced staffing levels and fewer loan payoffs 
income from operations declined by  or  in as compared to other expense  net declined dramatically due to gains on auction rate securities in compared to losses in  representing a  improvement and a reduction in interest expense as advances and advance financing balances declined despite higher average spreads and facility fees in compared to income from continuing operations before taxes climbed to  in from  in as noted above  we incurred a significant non recurring income tax expense associated with the separation and increased our liability for selected tax items by  representing the full amount of recognized deferred tax assets arising from deductibility of losses in a servicing advance finance structure 
these two items contributed to a higher effective tax rate in  the deferred portion of which was non cash 
as a result  income from continuing operations declined  or in as compared to discontinued operations for includes a pre tax gain of  realized on the sale of bok 
primarily due to the tax impact of the separation and the increase in our liability for selected tax items  net income declined from to change in financial condition summary the overall increase in our assets of  or during was principally the result of the following changes cash increased by  we liquidated our remaining investment in auction rate securities which had a fair value of  at december  through sales and the settlement of two litigation actions 
total advances increased by  largely as a result of the billion of servicing upb we acquired as part of the homeq acquisition in the third quarter and the billion of servicing upb we acquired in the saxon acquisition in the second quarter 
following acquisition  advances related to both the homeq and the saxon portfolios declined 
the increase in advances related to newly acquired portfolios was partly offset by declines in advances related to the existing portfolios 
loans restricted for securitization investors of  represent loans held by four securitization trusts that  effective january   we began to include in our consolidated financial statements under the provisions of asc  consolidation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
msrs increased by  due primarily to purchases of  including  as part of the homeq acquisition  offset by amortization expense of  we recorded goodwill of  related to the homeq acquisition 
other assets increased by  as a result of an increase in debt service accounts and debt issuance costs related to new borrowings incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition 
in addition  we were required to deposit  of cash collateral with the counterparties to interest rate swap agreements we entered into during the second quarter of liabilities increased by  or  during primarily because of the following items match funded liabilities increased by  reflecting the issuance of  of notes under the term asset backed securities loan facility talf program and the issuance of  of notes in connection with the financing of the advances acquired as part of the homeq acquisition   of which was outstanding at december  secured borrowings owed to securitization investors of  consists of certificates issued by the four securitization trusts that we began to include in our consolidated financial statements effective january  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings increased  due to a  senior secured term loan facility that we entered into in connection with homeq acquisition and secured borrowings of  under repurchase agreements 
these borrowings were partly offset by  of mandatory repayments and  of optional payments on the senior secured term loan and the first annual  repayment in march on our  fee reimbursement advance 
we fully repaid the investment line term note which had an outstanding balance of  at december  debt securities declined  as a result of repurchases 
in january  we repurchased in the open market  par value of our capital trust securities at a discount to par value 
other liabilities increased by  due to accruals of  established primarily in connection with the mdl and cartel litigation  a  derivative liability that represents the fair value of interest rate swaps we entered into during the second quarter of  accrued rent expense of  associated with our early termination of the homeq office leases and a our assumption of a  liability for checks held for escheat in connection with the homeq acquisition 
these increases were offset in part by a  reduction in the liability for selected tax items primarily due to the reversal of a reserve related to an advance financing structure 
liquidity summary we define liquidity as unencumbered cash balances plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity 
our liquidity as of december   as measured by cash and available credit  was  a decrease of  or  from december  at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  our available credit on collateralized but unused advance financing capacity was  at december  compared to  at december  our investment policies emphasize principal preservation by limiting investments to include securities issued by the us government  a us agency or a us government sponsored enterprise money market mutual funds money market demand deposits currently  we have primarily invested cash that is in excess of our immediate operating needs in money market demand deposit accounts 
furthermore  our investment policies are intended to minimize credit and counterparty risk by establishing risk limits designed to limit our exposure to each counterparty in relation to our equity with reference to each counterparty s long term credit ratings 
we regularly monitor and project cash flow timing in connection with our efforts to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on maintaining cash and unused borrowing capacity that is sufficient to meet the needs of the business at december    of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused 
however  as noted above  the amount of collateral pledged to these facilities limits additional borrowing  and only  of this amount is readily available 
the unused borrowing capacity in the servicing business may be utilized in the future by pledging additional qualifying collateral to these facilities 
we have begun to implement our plan to reduce unused borrowing capacity relative to the current levels of advances and match funded advances to a level that we consider prudent to meet our funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances in order to reduce interest expense 
interest rate risk summary interest rate risk is a function of i the timing and ii the dollar amount of assets and liabilities that re price at each point in time 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest rate sensitive liabilities mature or re price at different speeds  or different bases  than interest earning assets 
we have executed a hedging strategy aimed to largely neutralize the impact of changes in interest rates within a certain time period based on the projected excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over assets 
as of december   the value of our outstanding hedges was similar to the net exposure of projected interest rate sensitive liabilities and interest rate sensitive assets for the next several years 
future variances between the projected excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over assets and actual results could cause us to become over hedged or under hedged 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our use of derivatives 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our servicing business 
msrs are an intangible asset representing the right to service a portfolio of mortgage loans 
we generally obtain msrs by purchasing them from the owners of the mortgage loans 
as of december   we held residential msrs with a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  we account for our residential msrs using the amortization method 
all newly acquired msrs are initially measured at fair value 
we amortize the balance of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date 
we determine estimated net servicing income using the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio  which  absent new purchases  declines over time from prepayments and scheduled loan amortization 
we adjust amortization prospectively in response to changes in estimated p rojections of future cash flows 
we group the loans that we service into strata based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
our primary strata include subprime alt a high loan to value we estimate the fair value of our msrs by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
the significant components of the estimated future cash inflows for msrs include rate at which upb declines delinquencies servicing fees and ancillary income interest rate used for computing float earnings cost of servicing compensating interest expense discount rate interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances our internal valuation uses the same inputs but with reference to our historical experience rather than the assumptions of other industry participants 
the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage of upb by strata projected over the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value the primary assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of msrs by strata as of december  include the cost of financing advances month libor plus  float earnings month libor  a discount rate and the cost of servicing representing industry averages  which vary by strata and ranged from per year for a performing alt a loan to  per year for a loan in foreclosure 
we perform an impairment analysis of our msrs by strata based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for any strata we recognize an impairment valuation allowance 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as follows increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float earnings on higher float balances and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions will increase interest expense for financing servicing advances although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize 
valuation of loans held for resale loans held for resale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value 
we account for the excess of cost over fair value as a valuation allowance with changes in the valuation allowance included in gain loss on loans held for resale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
at december   all loans held for resale were measured at fair value because their cost of  exceeded their estimated fair value of  when we enter into an agreement to sell a loan to an investor at a set price  the loan is valued at the commitment price 
the fair value of loans for which we do not have a firm commitment to sell is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we stratify our fair value estimate of uncommitted loans held for resale based upon the delinquency status of the loans 
we base the fair value of our performing loans on the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows 
significant assumptions include collateral and loan characteristics  prevailing market conditions and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
the fair value of our non performing l oans is determined based upon the underlying value of the collateral supporting the loan and the estimated period and cost of disposition of the collateral 
deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment are involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and gross deferred tax liabilities of resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  we reduced our liability for selected tax items by  primarily as a result of deductions related to a servicing advance finance structure and to statute expirations 
we conduct periodic evaluations of positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized in future periods 
among the factors considered in this evaluation are estimates of future taxable income  future reversals of temporary differences  tax character ordinary versus capital and the impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented if warranted 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary at december  goodwill we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments  which are components one level below our business segments  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows based on a two step impairment test 
we evaluate the recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net carrying value including goodwill 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use for each segment discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
our goodwill impairment test involv es the making of estimates and the exercise of management judgment 
from time to time  we may obtain assistance from third parties in our evaluation 
the discounted cash flow valuation methodology uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows achieved 
in projecting our cash flows  we use projected growth rates or where applicable the projected prepayment rate 
for the discount rate  we use a rate which reflects our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting units over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
at december   the entire  balance of goodwill relates to the homeq acquisition and is included in the servicing segment 
we will perform our annual impairment test of the goodwill related to the homeq acquisition on august st of each year beginning in we will test for impairment sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we did not perform an annual impairment test during because the entire balance of goodwill was distributed to altisource on august  as part of the separation 
our annual test of goodwill for impairment t hat we completed in did not indicate any impairment 
however  in the second quarter of  we did record an impairment of the remaining  of goodwill related to bok  which was held for sale  based on offers that we had received that were less than carrying value 
litigation we monitor our litigation matters  including advice from external legal counsel  and regularly perform assessments of these matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
segment results and financial condition for each of our business segments  the following section provides a discussion of the changes in financial condition during the year ended december  and a discussion of pre tax results of operations for the annual periods ended december   and due to the separation as of august   neither the assets and liabilities  nor the subsequent operations of the mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments are included in our financial results

we consider all other loans to be non performing 
subprime loans represents the largest category  or strata  of residential loans we service 
at december   we serviced  subprime loans with a upb of  this compares to  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  and  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  excluding the homeq and saxon portfolios acquired in  the upb and number of non performing residential assets serviced as a percentage of the total portfolio were and  respectively  at december  does not include  employees transferred to ocwen as a result of the homeq acquisition  all of whom have since been terminated 
newly hired ocwen employees in the united states  india and uruguay are now supporting the servicing related duties for the loans acquired from homeq 
the following table provides information regarding the changes in the upb of our portfolio of residential assets serviced amount of upb count portfolio at beginning of year additions runoff portfolio at end of year versus residential servicing and subservicing fees increased due to the increase in the upb of residential assets serviced and an increase in modifications 
the average upb of residential assets serviced was higher in while residential servicing and subservicing fees increased by 
servicing fees for include  earned on the homeq portfolio for the period from the acquisition date of september  through december  at december   the percentage of upb representing servicing rather than subservicing was  a increase as compared to on december  this increase was a result of the billion of servicing upb that we acquired in the homeq acquisition and the billion of upb that we acquired in the saxon acquisition 
however  revenue declined relative to average upb in as compared to due primarily to a higher mix of subservicing in prior to our acquisition of the homeq and saxon servicing portfolios and to lower initial revenue yield on these acquired portfolios 
the effect on revenues of the homeq and saxon acquisitions was tempered by the fact that initial revenues from newly acquired servicing are principally the contractual servicing fee and late fees 
other ancillary revenues  which are driven by the resolution of non performing loans  ramp up gradually in the first year after the acquisition 
when we return a loan to performing status  we recognize revenue in the form of deferred servicing fees and late fees 
for loans modified under hamp  we earn hamp fees in place of late fees 
excluding hamp fees  we recognized loan servicing fees and late charges of  and  during and  respectively  as a result of modifications completed 
hamp fees were  and  in and  respectively 
hamp success fees that we earned on loans that were still performing at the one year anniversary of their modification represent  of the total hamp fees in we earned no success fees in  the first year of hamp 
we completed a total of  modifications during as compared to  during in  of completed modifications were hamp as compared to in as of december   we estimate that the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments was  compared to  as of december  the increase in is primarily due to the billion of servicing upb acquired in the homeq acquisition and the billion of servicing upb that we acquired in the saxon acquisition in the second quarter 
process management fees  revenues primarily comprised of referral commissions for residential reo properties sold through our network of brokers  were  lower in largely due to a decline in the number of properties sold 
sales of reo declined as loan modifications and short sales increased and as the foreclosure timeline lengthened 
partly offsetting the decline in commissions was a  increase in fees earned from altisource in connection with the preparation of foreclosure and similar documents on loans that have defaulted 
prior to the separation in august  servicing received a share of such fees from the former technology products segment as a reduction of allocated tec hnology and communication expense 
operating expenses increased by  primarily due to  of expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition  including severance and warn act compensation of  occupancy and equipment costs of  and professional fees of  occupancy and equipment costs include lease termination costs of  and a depreciation charge of  to write off leasehold improvements in connection with our decision to shutdown the leased homeq facilities that we acquired in sacramento  california and raleigh  north carolina 
we also established a  reserve in connection with the proposed settlement of the mdl proceeding incl uding  in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter 
corporate overhead expenses allocated to servicing increased by  primarily due to a decline in the relative size of the non servicing segments following the spin off of the former os segments to altisource in august in addition  the effect of the separation on our recognition of default document preparation fees as described above increased operating expenses by  in excluding the expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition and the reserve accrual for the mdl proceeding  operating expenses in the servicing segment increased by  or in  which is substantially less than the growth in average upb 
the decline in the normalized expense ratio is attributable to lower amortization expense relative to upb as long term cpr expectations decreased and low incremental operating expense as upb increases 
the overall delinquency rates at the end of and are similar 
within these composite totals  the delinquency rate on the portfolio that existed at the end of declined substantially in  but this decline was offset by higher delinquency rates on the newly acquired homeq and saxon portfolios 
delinquency rates on both the homeq and saxon portfolios have declined since boarding but are still higher than the rate for the prior portfolios 
excluding the effects of any new acquisitions or of any changes to foreclosure processes that may occur in  we expect overall delinquency rates to decline which represents a continuatio n of current trends 
the increase in total advances is the result of advances acquired as part of the homeq and saxon acquisitions 
excluding advances related to the homeq and saxon portfolios  total advances declined by  in we expect advances to continue to decline in before any new acquisitions or foreclosure process changes 
prepayment speed was lower in primarily due to a decline in real estate sales as loan modifications and short sales increased and as the foreclosure timeline lengthened 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately in interest expense on borrowings for was higher than principally because of an increase in average borrowings on advance facilities  the closing of the  senior secured term loan  higher average interest rates on the subordinated notes on the homeq advance facility and the costs associated with the increase in unused advance financing capacity 
these increases were partly offset by lower spreads on advance facilities 
average servicing borrowings increased by during as compared to as average advances and match funded advances increased by during the same period 
interest expense for includes  of net settlements related to interest rate swap agre ements that we entered into during the second quarter of versus servicing and subservicing fees declined due to the decline in the average upb of residential assets serviced and lower modifications in due to the implementation of hamp 
compliance with hamp borrower documentation requirements caused loan modifications that would ordinarily have been completed in to be delayed 
lower average custodial account balances  due to lower upb and reduced loan payoff collections  and lower interest rates also contributed to the overall decline in total revenues 
as subservicing and special servicing arrangements represent a larger portion of our portfolio  we expect revenues to decline 
however  we anticipate such declines to be more than offset by lower amortization and interest expense 
we estimate that during the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments increased by  to  as of december  operating expenses benefited from lower msr amortization expense  reduced staffing levels and lower servicing and origination expense 
amortization expense declined in as the projected average prepayment speed cpr fell and we shifted our portfolio composition to more subservicing arrangements leading to a lower average msr balance in  as compared to our efforts to reduce staffing levels resulted in a decline in compensation and benefits expense as we reduced our average us headcount and maintained our india staffing level 
approximately two thirds of the decline in average us employment was due to our decision in july not to renew our contract with the us de partment of veterans affairs va 
servicing and origination expense declined as a result of a decline in voluntary loan payoffs 
the delinquency rate remained relatively stable in total advances have continued to decline in  however  the effects of implementing hamp slowed the rate of decline 
lower upb and increased sales of reo also contributed to the decline in advances 
prepayment speed was lower in primarily due to a decline in loan payoffs partly offset by an increase in real estate sales 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately for we completed  modifications in as compared to  in in  of completed modifications were hamp and the remaining non hamp 
the split between hamp and non hamp modifications is to be expected since the earliest period in which completed hamp modifications could occur was the third quarter 
we completed  modifications in the fourth quarter of  of which  were hamp and  were non hamp 
the number of completed modifications in the fourth quarter of was higher than the  modifications completed in the third quarter of completed modifications were lower in the second and third quarters of than in prior quarters because of the challenges imposed by the need to collect the requisite documentation from borrowers and make the changes in our work streams necessitated by the hamp program 
hamp modification offers were extended to  borrowers in interest expense in was lower than in principally because of the decline in match funded advances coupled with our strategy of reducing advance financing through the use of cash reserves and the proceeds of our equity offering 
at december   of match funded advances were funded through borrowings as compared to at december  although the majority of our credit facilities bear interest at rates that are adjusted regularly based on month libor  our average effective interest rate for did not decline in proportion to the decline in libor 
this is principally the result of the higher spreads over libor charged on the new match funded facilities that we add ed in and and higher facility fees charged by the lenders on the new facilities and on the renewal of existing facilities regardless of the amount of borrowing 
the following table shows selected assets and liabilities of our servicing segment as of december advances match funded advances mortgage servicing rights residential receivables  net goodwill debt service accounts prepaid lender fees and debt issuance costs  net other total assets match funded liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings servicer liabilities accrued expenses checks held for escheat deferred income servicing liability accrued interest payable other total liabilities the increase in advances during is primarily due to the  of advances acquired in connection with the billion of servicing upb we acquired from homeq servicing 
in addition  we acquired  of advances in connection with the billion of servicing upb acquired in the saxon acquisition in the second quarter 
in addition to the  of msrs we acquired as part of the homeq acquisition  the saxon acquisition included  of msrs 
these additions were offset in part by amortization of  the increase in receivables primarily reflects the growth in the servicing portfolio in receivables include reimbursable expenditures due from investors and amounts to be recovered from the custodial accounts of the trustees 
partly offsetting the increase attributed to portfolio growth  the amount due from freddie mac in connection with a loan subservicing agreement declined from  at december  to  at december  goodwill recorded in connection with the homeq acquisition 
see note for additional information regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the homeq acquisition 
in connection with the establishment of the  advance facility that we used to finance the advances acquired as part of the homeq acquisition we paid  of fees  including a  securitization fee 
these costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over three years to the amortization date of the notes 
we also funded a debt service reserve account in the initial amount of  the outstanding balance of this advance facility at december  was  we paid  of fees in connection with the  senior secured term loan facility agreement that was used to fund a portion of the homeq acquisition

the balance also includes the  accrual established in connection with the proposed settlement of the mdl proceeding during the increase during is due to the  of checks held for escheat that we assumed in connection with the homeq acquisition

in consolidation  we eliminate our investment in the securities we hold that were issued by the trusts  as well as the related interest income and the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value 
the securitization trusts are essentially pass through entities 
however  as a result of including the trusts in our consoli dated financial statements we established an allowance for losses on the loans and real estate held by the trusts 
for  the trusts generated income from continuing operations before income taxes of  which includes the effect of the reversal of a portion of the allowance for loan losses in the amount of the decrease in the allowance results from a decline in the unpaid principal balance of the loans and real estate and an improvement in the past due status of nonperforming loans  particularly loans more than days delinquent and loans in foreclosure 
see note to our consolidated financial statements securitizations of residential mortgage loans  for additional information 
versus interest income was higher in than it was in principally because of the effects of including the four securitization trusts in our consolidated financial statements beginning january  the trusts generated interest income of  in this effect was partially offset by lower interest income on loans held for sale because of an decline in the upb of the portfolio during in addition  in we have eliminated in consolidation the interest income on the securities we hold that were issued by the trust 
interest expense declined largely because of the repayment in september of a facility used to finance our loans held for resale 
loss on loans held for resale  net decreased because of a smaller loan portfolio  fewer loans entering non performing status and a slowing of the declines in the valuation of the loan portfolio 
the change in other  net  is principally attributable to  of losses on loans recognized by the securitization trusts offset by from the reversal of a portion of the allowance for loans losses on trust loans and a increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap held by one of the trusts 
versus interest expense declined in  compared to  due to a lower average loan principal balance  the repayment of debt and lower interest rates 
we repaid the remaining outstanding notes on september interest income declined due to a lower average loan principal balance  increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans increased defaults and unrecoverable losses on the underlying mortgage loans and lower interest rates

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity as of december   as measured by unencumbered cash plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity was  a decrease of  or  from december  at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  we have invested cash that is in excess of our immediate operating needs primarily in money market deposit accounts 
investment policy and funding strategy 
our primary sources of funds for near term liquidity are collections of servicing fees and ancillary revenues  proceeds from match funded liabilities  proceeds from lines of credit and other secured borrowings  and payments received on loans held for resale 
in addition to these near term sources  additional long term sources of liquidity include proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds are payments for advances in excess of collections on existing servicing portfolios  payment of interest and operating costs  purchase of msrs and related advances  and repayments of borrowings 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements 
we regularly monitor and project cash flow by period in connection with our efforts to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on three measures requirements for maturing liabilities compared to dollars generated from maturing assets and operating cash flow  the change in advances and match funded advances compared to the change in match funded liabilities and unused borrowing capacity 
at december    of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused 
we maintain unused borrowing capacity for three reasons as a protection should advances increase due to increased delinquencies  as a protection should we be unable to either renew existing facilities or obtain new facilities and to provide capacity for the acquisition of additional servicing rights 
outlook 
as noted in the overview liquidity summary section  we have begun to implement our plan to reduce unused borrowing capacity relative to the current levels of advances and match funded advances to a level that we consider prudent to meet our funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances in order to reduce interest expense 
we also monitor the duration of our funding sources 
with the increase in the term of our funding sources  we have better matched the duration of our advances and corresponding borrowings and further reduced the relative cost of up front facility fees and expenses 
our  of talf issuances   variable funding term note and  homeq facility which is funded with three year term notes account for of our drawn advance financing on december  debt financing summary 
during  we issued  of notes in connection with the financing of advances acquired as part of the homeq acquisition  renewed a  advance note  entered into a  senior secured term loan that was issued with an original issued discount of  and used to fund a portion of the homeq acquisition as well as for general corporate purposes  of which  was repaid in  renewed and extended a variable funding note with a maximum borrowing capacity of  issued  of advance receivable backed notes under the talf program  fully repaid  on our auction rate securities investment line  renewed a  advance note  entered into financing agreements collateralized by ocwen real estate asset liquidating trust notes with a par value of  repurchased capital trust securities with a face value of  repaid  on our original  fee reimbursement advance  and repaid  on our original  term note 
maximum borrowing capacity for match funded advances increased by  from  at december  to  at december  this increase is the result of our issuance of  of notes in connection with the financing of advances acquired as part of the homeq acquisition  our issuance of a  talf note and our ability to renew and increase other advance facility notes before they entered their amortization period 
these increases were partly offset by our termination in december of a  facility that was about to enter its amortization period 
despite an increase in advances and match funded advances of  that resulted primarily from o ur acquisition of the billion homeq servicing portfolio and the billion saxon servicing portfolio  our unused advance borrowing capacity increased from  at december  to  at december  our ability to finance servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity 
two of our match funded advance facilities that are rated are subject to increases in the financing discount if deemed necessary by the rating agencies in order to maintain the minimum rating required for the facility 
while fitch has placed the notes under our advance receivable backed note series on negative watch  we do not expect future advance rate changes to have a material effect on our liquidity 
our ability to continue to pledge collateral under each advance facility depends on the performance of the collateral 
currently  the large majority of our collateral qualifies for financing under th e advance facility to which it is pledged 
as discussed in the business corporate strategy and outlook strategic priorities  recent inquiries into servicer foreclosure processes could result in actions by state or federal governmental bodies  regulators or the courts that could result in a further extension of foreclosure timelines 
if this results in an increase in advances  the effect on liquidity will be lessened if ocwen maintains its ability to utilize spare capacity on its advance facilities as approximately of the increase in advances could be borrowed 
conversely  if foreclosure moratoria are issued in a manner that is undefined such that there is a question around whether advances on foreclos ed properties can be recovered in a timely manner  ocwen may no longer be obligated to advance and may be able to recover existing advances in certain securitizations from pool level collections which could cause advances to decrease 
if any fines are assessed  this will reduce earnings and cash 
one of our match funded advance facilities has provisions that limit new borrowing if average foreclosure timelines extend beyond a certain time period which under extreme circumstances could adversely affect liquidity by reducing our average effective advance rates 
the extension of foreclosure timelines thus far has been more than offset by increases in other forms of resolution and advances have continued to decline 
absent more drastic foreclosure process changes  we expect advances to continue to decline 
some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt in relation to our equity  require that we do not exceed maximum levels of delinquent loans and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets and earnings 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in restrictions on new borrowings or the early termination of our borrowing facilities 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants and do not expect them to restrict our activities 
on january   we voluntarily repaid  of the senior secured term loan  and on february  we repaid an additional  we made these prepayments in order to absorb excess liquidity and to reduce interest expense 
following these payments  the remaining principal balance of the senior secured term loan is  by not repaying this facility in full and instead repaying the remaining balance as the next four mandatory repayments come due  we will keep this facility open through the end of which may enable us to utilize the accordion feature of the loan to fund additional servicing acquisitions should attractive opportunities arise

involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the financing of our servicing advances and in the securitization of mortgage loans 
our securitizations of mortgage loans were structured as sales 
the spes to which we transferred the mortgage loans were qspes and  therefore under previous accounting rules  were not subject to consolidation through we have retained both subordinated and residual interests in these spes 
where we are the servicer of the securitized loans  we generally have the right to repurchase the mortgage loans from the spe when the costs exceed the benefits of servicing the remaining loans 
as disclosed in the recent accounting developments below  accounting standards were amended effective january  to eliminate the concept of a qspe 
we reevaluated these qspes as well as all other potentia lly significant interests in other unconsolidated entities to determine if we should include them in our consolidated financial statements 
we determined that four of these loan securitization trusts are vies and that we are the primary beneficiary 
we have included these four trusts in our consolidated financial statements effective january  we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because the transfer did not qualify for sales accounting treatment  because we have the majority equity interest in the spe  or because we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
however  ols has guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under one of our match funded facilities 
the maximum amount p ayable under the guarantee is limited to of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period

in addition to certain of our financing spes  we have invested in several other vies primarily in connection with purchases of whole loans 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we report the vie in our consolidated financial statements

asu asc  transfers and servicing 
the amendments in this update eliminated the exceptions for qspes from the consolidation guidance asc  consolidation and clarified that the objective of the standard is to determine whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
this statement modified the financial components approach previously used and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when th e transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset 
this statement requires that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained including a transferor s beneficial interest and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
enhanced disclosures are required to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
we adopted this standard effective january  as a result of which  we reevaluated certain qspes with which we had ongoing relationships as further described under asu  below  and reassessed the adequacy of our disclosures with regard to our servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
asu asc  consolidation 
the amendments in this update require an enterprise to perform ongoing periodic assessments to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
we adopted this standard effective january  this analysis replaced the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for identifying the primary beneficiary of a vie to an approach focused on identifying which enterprise the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of th e entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
in addition to reintroducing the concept of control into the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie  this statement also amended the existing standards to require enhanced disclosures that provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
the enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a vie 
the additional disclosures required by this statement are included in note to the consolidated financial statements principles of consolidation 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements securitizations of residential mortgage loans  we previously excluded certain loan securitization trusts from our consolidated financial statements because each was a qspe 
effective january   we reevaluated these qspes as well as all other potentially significant interests in other unconsolidated entities to determine if we should include them in our consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of asu on january  we began consolidating four residential mortgage loan securitization trusts and recorded a  increase in total assets  a  increase in liabilities and a  increase in th e opening balance of retained earnings
