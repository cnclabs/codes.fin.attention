item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report on form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in us dollars 
management overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need 
our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide 
headquartered in foster city  california  we have operations in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we market products in the hiv aids  liver disease  respiratory and cardiovascular metabolic therapeutic areas 
our product portfolio is comprised of atripla efavirenz mg emtricitabine mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate mg  truvada emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  viread tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtriva emtricitabine for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection  hepsera adefovir dipivoxil and viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b  ambisome amphotericin b liposome for injection for the treatment of severe fungal infections  letairis ambrisentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah  ranexa ranolazine for the treatment of chronic angina  vistide cidofovir injection for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and cayston aztreonam for inhalation solution as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis cf patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa p 
aeruginosa 
in addition  we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty paying collaborative agreements 
for example  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc  roche markets tamiflu oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment and prevention of influenza  glaxosmithkline inc gsk markets hepsera and viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in certain territories outside of the united states  gsk also markets volibris ambrisentan outside of the united states for the treatment of pah  astellas pharma us  inc markets ambisome for the treatment of severe fungal infections in the united states and canada  astellas us llc markets lexiscan regadenoson injection in the united states for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging  rapidscan pharma solutions  inc markets rapiscan regadenoson in certain territories outside of the united states for the inducement of pharmacological stress and or vasodilation of the coronary vasculature strictly for purposes of diagnosing cardiovascular disease  menarini international operations luxembourg sa markets ranexa in certain territories outside of the united states for the treatment of chronic angina  and japan tobacco inc japan tobacco markets truvada  viread and emtriva in japan 
business highlights during  we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline programs 
our antiviral franchise  in particular atripla and truvada  continued to drive product sales growth both in the united states and within the big five european union markets  which are comprised of the united kingdom  france  germany  italy and spain 
our cardiovascular franchise also delivered strong results for the year with the contributions of letairis and ranexa to our total revenues 
our newest product  cayston  in the respiratory area  was well accepted in north america and certain countries of europe  showing continued revenue growth throughout 
table of contents during the year  we also made strategic decisions to advance and focus our research and development r d pipeline efforts  including in the hiv area  in september  we announced that we had submitted a marketing authorization application to the european medicines agency for marketing approval of the single tablet regimen of truvada and tibotec pharmaceuticals tibotec investigational non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  tmc rilpivirine hydrochloride  for the treatment of hiv infection in adults 
in november  we announced that we had submitted a new drug application nda to the us food and drug administration fda for marketing approval of the single tablet regimen of truvada and tibotec s tmc  for the treatment of hiv infection in adults 
in january  we received a refuse to file notification from the us fda 
in its communication  the fda requested additional information with respect to the chemistry  manufacturing and controls section of the nda submission 
in february  we re filed our new drug application  which included the requested information  and are awaiting the fda s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review 
also in the hiv area  during  we initiated both phase clinical studies for our investigational fixed dose  single tablet quad regimen of elvitegravir  cobicistat formerly gs and truvada 
the two phase studies are evaluating the single tablet fixed dose regimen versus a standard of care among hiv infected treatment na ve patients 
in the second quarter of  we also initiated a phase study evaluating the efficacy  safety and tolerability of cobicistat  our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain hiv medicines and other antivirals 
in september  we released positive week results from two of our ongoing phase clinical studies in hiv infected patients 
the first were from the study of our fixed dose  single tablet quad regimen of elvitegravir  cobicistat and truvada versus atripla 
the second were from the study of cobicistat boosted atazanavir plus truvada compared to ritonavir boosted atazanavir plus truvada 
in the liver disease area  our hepatitis c virus hcv pipeline now includes seven unique molecules spanning six therapeutic classes with different mechanisms of action 
five of these compounds are currently in clinical trials  and two are slated to enter human clinical studies in early in october  we announced data from a phase a study showing that our investigational compounds gs and gs  used in conjunction with current standard of care therapies  produced substantial suppression of hcv within days of treatment 
additionally  in october  we announced new data from the open label phase of two pivotal phase clinical trials studies and evaluating the four year efficacy of viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection  which show that viread maintains antiviral suppression with no development of resistance through four years of treatment 
data also show significant s antigen loss  a marker of the resolution of chronic hbv infection  in hbeag positive patients 
also in the liver disease area  in july  john mchutchison  md  joined gilead as senior vice president  liver disease therapeutics to lead the efforts to advance discovery and development programs in the liver disease area 
in the respiratory area  we announced in october that our head to head phase clinical trial of cayston versus tobramycin inhalation solution tis in cf patients with p 
aeruginosa achieved its co primary endpoint of superiority of cayston to tis for mean actual change in forced expiratory volume in one second fev  a measure of lung function percent predicted across three treatment cycles six months 
earlier in the year  in february  we received marketing approval from the fda for cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cf patients with p 
aeruginosa 
in the cardiovascular and metabolic areas  in december  we announced the termination of artemis ipf  our phase study of ambrisentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf 
this decision follows an interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and safety data by the study s data monitoring committee and our review of those data  which did not show evidence of a treatment benefit in the group of patients randomized to receive ambrisentan 

table of contents during the year  we also expanded our pipeline through strategic acquisitions 
we completed the acquisition of arresto biosciences  inc arresto in january for million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels 
arresto was a privately held  development stage biotechnology company based in palo alto  california  focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer 
the company s lead product is gs formerly ab  a humanized monoclonal antibody mab targeting the human lysyl oxidase like loxl protein 
in addition to an ongoing phase study of gs in patients with advanced solid tumors  a phase study is being conducted to evaluate gs in patients with ipf 
we completed the acquisition of cgi pharmaceuticals  inc cgi in july for up to million in cash  the majority as an upfront payment and the remaining based on the achievement of certain clinical development milestones 
cgi was a privately held development stage pharmaceutical company based in branford  connecticut  primarily focused on small molecule chemistry and protein kinase biology 
the lead preclinical compound from cgi s library of proprietary small molecule kinase inhibitors targets spleen tyrosine kinase syk and could have unique applications for the treatment of serious inflammatory diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis 
financial highlights our operating results for were led by total product sales of billion  an increase of over total product sales of billion for the increase in product sales was driven primarily by our antiviral franchise atripla  truvada  viread  hepsera and emtriva  due mainly to the strong growth in atripla sales 
atripla contributed billion  or  to our antiviral product sales 
atripla product sales for increased from primarily due to sales volume growth in the united states and europe 
truvada product sales for comprised billion  or of antiviral product sales 
truvada product sales for increased from primarily due to sales volume growth in the united states and europe 
foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of million and million on our revenues and pre tax earnings  respectively  compared to product sales in the united states were driven primarily by our antiviral franchise but also reflected growth in sales of our cardiovascular products 
antiviral product sales in the united states increased in compared to  resulting from the continued growth of patient and market share in the united states 
with respect to our cardiovascular franchise  ranexa sales in the united states were million in  reflecting a continued growth in demand as ranexa prescriptions have increased by since our acquisition of cv therapeutics  inc cv therapeutics in april ranexa sales were million in for the period subsequent to our acquisition of cv therapeutics 
furthermore  letairis sales contributed million to product sales in the united states  reflecting a increase from our newest product  cayston  also contributed million during its first year of sales in  the majority of which was in the united states 
product sales in europe were driven by antiviral product sales  which increased in compared to  due to continued strong growth in demand 
while we saw demand growth for our products in europe  the effect was partially offset by recent mandatory price reductions in certain european countries and foreign currency exchange impact from a strengthening us dollar relative to european currencies 
royalty revenues recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were million for  an increase of million or from royalty revenues of million for other royalty revenues  which include royalties from gsk for hepsera  royalties from astellas for lexiscan and royalties from japan tobacco for truvada  contributed to the increase in total royalty revenues  partially offset by tamiflu royalties from roche which decreased from million in to million in our r d and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million  or for compared to the increase was due primarily to impairment charges related to in process r d 
table of contents ipr d assets acquired from cv therapeutics  higher headcount and expenses to support our expanding commercial activities and clinical studies expenses related to increased hiv research activities  partially offset by lower r d expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with tibotec 
we approved and communicated a plan during the second quarter of to close our research operations in durham  north carolina and consolidate our liver disease research activities in foster city  california 
we believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in the liver disease area 
during the year  we incurred a total of million of restructuring expenses related to employee severance and facilities related expenses under this plan 
in december  we closed our operations in durham 
we do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan 
financing activity cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by billion during  driven primarily by our operating cash flows of billion and proceeds of billion from the issuance of convertible senior notes  net of issuance costs  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
under our current three year  billion stock repurchase program authorized in may  we repurchased billion of our common stock through december  in may  we had completed the billion stock repurchase program previously authorized in january for the year  we utilized a total of billion of cash to repurchase and retire million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share 
our board authorized an additional three year  billion stock repurchase program in january for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock which will commence upon the completion of our existing program authorized in may we intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase our shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically 
we issued billion of convertible senior notes in july in a private placement and purchased convertible note hedges as well as sold warrants for a net cost of million 
the cost of the convertible note hedges will be tax deductible over the life of the notes 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing our conversion prices for the notes 
our interest expense for increased by million compared to  due primarily to increased interest expense related to the notes 
we have used and will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay existing indebtedness 
healthcare reform in march  healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the united states 
as a result  we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers  including medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the b drug pricing program under the public health service act  such as aids drug assistance programs adaps 
the discounts  rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include effective january   our minimum base rebate amount owed to medicaid on products reimbursed by medicaid was increased by  and the discounts or rebates we owe to adaps and other public health service entities which reimburse or purchase our products were also increased by  effective march   we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through medicaid managed care organizations  effective january   we are required to provide a discount on products sold to patients while they are in the medicare part d donut hole  and 
table of contents effective  we  along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products  are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee also known as the pharmaceutical excise tax  calculated based on select government sales during the calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales 
starting in  as the number of people with access to healthcare coverage is expected to increase  we could experience a positive impact on the sales of our products 
further  the expansion of healthcare coverage may decrease the reliance of patients on state adaps that currently rely on the availability of federal and state funding 
the full impact of healthcare reform for was a reduction of approximately million in us net product sales 
the majority of this impact began in the third quarter and continued throughout the fourth quarter of since some of the new discount and rebate requirements took two quarters to fully take effect 
for  excluding the impact of the new pharmaceutical excise tax  we estimate that the impact of healthcare reform on product sales will be approximately of our us net product sales 
many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform legislation have yet to be decided and communicated by the federal government 
for example  we do not know how many or how quickly patients receiving our product under the medicare part d program will reach the donut hole or how details of the pharmaceutical excise tax will be calculated 
based on the information that we have to date  we estimate the impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between million  which will be classified as sg a expense 
the excise tax is not tax deductible 
in calculating the anticipated financial impacts of healthcare reform described above  we made several estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected payer mix and how the reforms will be implemented 
outlook our operating objectives for include increasing the market share of our commercial products  continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and or externally in licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances 
additionally  we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders as we continue to repurchase our shares in a disciplined manner throughout the year 
from an r d standpoint  we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative hiv single tablet regimens for patients and progression of hcv molecules into the clinic 
from a commercial standpoint  we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises 
in the hiv area  we expect to see continued positive impact from the revised us department of health and human services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with hiv 
the extension of the ryan white treatment act should provide stable funding for adaps in the united states through assuming the timely resolution of the issues with the refuse to file notification from the fda  we expect to launch a single tablet regimen of truvada and tibotec s tmc in the second half of which we expect to contribute incremental revenue to our hiv franchise 
in february  we re filed our new drug application  which included the requested information  and are awaiting the fda s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review 
in the hepatitis b virus hbv area  we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on us asian communities  highlighting the need to screen  diagnose and link patients to care 
as part of those efforts  in  we expanded our hepatitis b field team in the united states 
in the cardiovascular area  we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of gilead in the pah and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of letairis and ranexa in in cystic fibrosis  we intend to expand our field team to further grow our market share for cayston 
we are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include any future changes to healthcare 
table of contents reform in the united states  a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions  patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors  continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes  as appropriate  to mitigate these risks to our business 
the successes we experienced in have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial  collaborative and r d activities and to maintain quality and compliance 
as we continue to grow our business  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management 
government rebates we estimate reductions to our revenues for government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
these reductions are settled either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge backs from our wholesalers 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the united states  to date  payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates 
for government programs in the united states  we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our 
table of contents expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during   and  u 
s government rebates of billion  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued us government rebates of million and million  respectively  in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our us government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total intangible assets in conjunction with business combinations that we have completed  we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products  ipr d projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
identifiable intangible assets  such as those related to marketed products or ipr d projects  are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
we believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates  the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we test 
table of contents goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts 
as of december   we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets consisting of million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and million of intangible assets related to the ipr d projects that we acquired from cgi and cv therapeutics 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the ranexa product  which we acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for ranexa 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the lexiscan product  which we also acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight line basis 
given that current lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner s future sales forecasts  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach 
as of december   we had million of net unamortized finite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from cv therapeutics 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results  our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets  legal and regulatory factors and events  our overall business strategy and market and economic trends 
if events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain ipr d assets acquired from cv therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants 
these charges related to the gs  adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in r d expense 
the majority of the impairment charge related to our gs program  a product candidate that was in phase clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia  which was terminated in the fourth quarter of due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients 
given these results  we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants 
allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
as of december  and  we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million and million  respectively 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cros 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining clinical activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose phase clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase clinical study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of atripla  truvada  viread  hepsera  emtriva  letairis and ranexa 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated 
some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract 
such 
table of contents additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we may have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  our portion of the non tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax that we will be required to pay starting in as a result of the enactment of us healthcare reform legislation  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
at december  and  the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were million and million  respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million and million at december  and  respectively  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
as of december   we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions 
with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits  we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective tax authorities 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for federal income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onward 
for certain acquired entities  the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years 
for california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open for and onwards 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the  and tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain 
table of contents tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
stock based compensation we measure all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  based on their relative fair values 
fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected award life 
stock based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to january   and using the straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share based payments to employees and directors on january  as stock based compensation expenses  related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
prior to the adoption of this guidance  pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred

these amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  collaboration and development arrangements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above 

table of contents at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros

these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or terminations of  existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts 
we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of million as of december  we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions 
with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits  we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective tax authorities

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  however  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  in response to the pharmaceutical excise tax mandated by healthcare reform legislation adopted in the united states  the fasb issued a new standard to address how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify this tax in their income statements 
effective  we  along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products  are required to pay a portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax  calculated based on select government sales for the preceding calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales 
the new standard clarifies that the pharmaceutical excise tax shall be presented as an operating expense and that the liability related to the tax shall be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense generally using a straight line method of allocation 
the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we estimate the impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between million  which will be classified as sg a expense in our consolidated financial statements 
also in december  the fasb issued an update to its existing standard for business combinations to address the pro forma financial disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the updated standard specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  however  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and asia pacific 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  
table of contents the most significant of which is the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales 
we also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  weighted average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at december  we had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at december  all contracts have maturities of months or less 
weighted average rates are stated in terms of the amount of us dollars per foreign currency

with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating  maturity  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return

the notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of and for the notes and notes  respectively  and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances 
credit risk as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities within our available for sale long term marketable securities 
our auction rate securities comprised approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  in  we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans 
most of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failed auctions  are currently rated aaa  consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy  supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program and over collateralized 
our auction rate securities reset every seven to days with maturity dates ranging from through and have annual interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   our auction rate securities continued to earn interest 
if auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
however  based on our total cash and marketable securities position  our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility  we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities  which may be at final maturity 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital 
in light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets  we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently 
we believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy  safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  as well as liquidity  has helped protect us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities 
we are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  the majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the united states and europe 
to date  
table of contents we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at december
