our asset based fee and performance fee revenues benefited from the increase in our assets under management in revenue increased approximately  from million in to  million in consolidated performance fee revenues increased approximately from million in to million in net income controlling interest increased in as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue and income from equity method investments

diversification of assets under management the following table provides information regarding the composition of our assets under management december  december  december  in billions assets under management percentage of total assets under management percentage of total assets under management percentage of total asset class equity alternative fixed income total geography domestic global international emerging markets total the equity asset class includes equity  balanced and asset allocation products 

table of contents the alternative asset class includes private equity  multi strategy  market neutral equity and hedge products 
the geography of a particular investment product describes the general location of its investment holdings 
our assets under management increased significantly during the year ended december   in large part  as a result of new affiliate investments in artemis  aston  pantheon and trilogy 
the investments in pantheon  artemis and trilogy further diversified our business by increasing our exposure to alternative  global international and emerging market product offerings 
results of operations the following tables present a rollforward of our assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k

table of contents other includes assets under management attributable to affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in certain affiliated investment management firms  the financial effects of which are not material to our ongoing results 
as shown in the assets under management table above  client cash inflows totaled billion while client cash outflows totaled billion for the year ended december  the net flows for the year ended december  occurred across a broad range of product offerings in each of our distribution channels  with no individual cash inflow or outflow having a material impact on our revenue or expenses 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represents an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management reflects the billing patterns of particular client accounts 
for example  assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning of period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

table of contents note to the consolidated financial statements on page describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain investments and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes 
our share of profits from these investments is reported in income from equity method investments and is therefore reflected in net income and ebitda 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources on page percentage change is not meaningful 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management  the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees 
as described in the overview section above  performance fees are generally measured on absolute or relative investment performance against a benchmark 
as a result  the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in assets under management 
our revenue increased million or in from  primarily as a result of a increase in average assets under management and our investments in new affiliates that realize comparatively higher fee rates 
the increase in average assets under management resulted principally from our new affiliate investments  strong investment performance and positive net client cash flows 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  consolidated performance fee revenue increased million to million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our revenue decreased million or in from  primarily as a result of a decrease in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management resulted principally from the decline in global equity markets in and negative net client cash flows 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  performance fees decreased million to million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments

the decrease in average assets resulted principally from the decline in global equity markets in  partially offset by our and investments in new affiliates 
the decline in revenue was proportionately greater than the decline in average assets under management as a result of the effects of advance billing  and the increase in assets under management that realize comparatively lower fee rates 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which is incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocations 
during  approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to our affiliate managers from their operating allocations 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses increased in the increase was attributable to increases in aggregate affiliate expenses of million from new affiliate investments  and million from the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at extant affiliates  which 
table of contents experienced increases in revenue  and accordingly  reported higher compensation expenses 
this increase was also attributable to increases in holding company incentive and share based compensation  as compared to compensation and related expenses decreased in this decrease was primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate decreases in revenue and accordingly  reported lower compensation expense 
the decrease in was also attributable to a million decrease in share based compensation resulting from a charge in from senior management surrender of stock options  which did not recur in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in this increase resulted principally from increases in aggregate affiliate expenses of million from new affiliate investments 
this increase also resulted from a million increase in acquisition related professional fees  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in this decrease resulted from a decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses attributable to a decline in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel  a million decrease in acquisition related professional fees  and million of one time affiliate expenses in  which did not recur in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from new affiliate investments 
amortization of intangible assets increased in  principally attributable to increases in definite lived intangible assets resulting from new affiliate investments 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in principally attributable to a decrease in definite lived intangible assets  partially offset by new affiliate investments in depreciation and other amortization increased in  principally attributable to a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from new affiliate investments 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in spending on depreciable assets in recent periods 
depreciation and other amortization was essentially flat in other operating expenses increased in  principally attributable to a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from new affiliate investments  partially offset by a decrease in losses realized on transfers of affiliate interests in  as compared to other operating expenses increased in  principally as a result of an increase in the loss realized on the transfer of affiliate interests 
other income statement data the following table summarizes non operating income and expense data in millions change change income loss from equity method investments nm investment and other income investment income loss from investments in partnerships nm interest expense imputed interest expense income tax expense percentage change is not meaningful 

table of contents income loss from equity method investments consists of our share of income loss from affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  net of any related intangible amortization 
income from equity method investments increased in  principally as a result of a million increase in performance fees to million earned by affiliates that we account for under the equity method of accounting 
income loss from equity method investments increased substantially in  principally as a result of a million non cash impairment charge in  as partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization expense of million 
investment and other income decreased in  principally as a result of a million gain on the settlement of a contingent payment in described further below  partially offset by a million increase in investment and other income from new affiliates  as well as increases in investment earnings 
investment and other income decreased in  principally from million of non recurring gains in  partially offset by an increase in affiliate investment earnings as well as a million gain on the settlement of a contingent payment related to our new investment in harding loevner 
investment income loss from investments in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates serve as the general partner 
in the third quarter of  we deconsolidated these partnerships 
for and  the income loss from investments in partnerships was million and million  respectively  which was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us 
interest expense increased in  principally as a result of increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which was amended and restated in january the revolver 
interest expense decreased in  principally attributable to a million decrease from a decline in revolver borrowings  a million decrease from the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities and settlement of our mandatory convertible securities and a million decrease resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our junior convertible trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million attributable to the issuance of our senior convertible securities in the third quarter of imputed interest expense consists of interest accretion on our senior convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities as well as the accretion of our projected contingent payment arrangements 
imputed interest expense increased in  principally as a result of a million increase in accretion related to our contingent payment arrangements 
imputed interest expense increased in  principally as a result of a million increase in the accretion on our senior convertible securities issued in the third quarter of  partially offset by a million decrease resulting from the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities 
income taxes increased in  as the result of an increase in income before income taxes and approximately million of taxes attributable to non controlling interests from our new affiliate investments 
this increase was partially offset by a million benefit from revaluing certain deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change to corporate tax rates in the united kingdom 
income taxes increased in principally as a result of the increase in net income controlling interest 
this increase was offset by million of benefits realized from the restructuring of certain affiliate relationships  a million reduction in valuation allowances on state net operating losses and a charge to revalue our deferred tax liabilities for changes in massachusetts tax laws  which did not recur in 
table of contents net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years in millions change change net income net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships nm net income non controlling interests net income loss controlling interest nm percentage change is not meaningful 
net income increased and in and  respectively  for the reasons described below 
net income attributable to non controlling interests increased in and decreased in these changes resulted principally from the previously discussed changes in revenue 
in  the increase was proportionately less than the increase in revenue as a result of the previously discussed increases in tax expenses 
in both periods  affiliate equity repurchases had the effect of decreasing affiliate equity ownership  and therefore decreasing the income attributable to non controlling interests 
net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates are the general partner 
in the third quarter of  we deconsolidated these partnerships 
in and  the net income loss from affiliate investment partnerships attributable to the non controlling interests was million  and million  respectively 
net income controlling interest increased in as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue and income from equity method investments  partially offset by increases in reported operating and income tax expenses and income attributable to non controlling interests 
net income controlling interest increased substantially in  principally the result of the increase in income from equity method investments and a decrease in operating expenses  partially offset by a decrease in revenue and income attributable to non controlling interests 
supplemental performance measures in reporting our financial and operating results during the second quarter of  we renamed our non gaap performance measures to economic net income and economic earnings per share formerly known as cash net income and cash earnings per share 
we consider economic net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents our operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our investment management firms 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are used by our management and board of directors as our principal performance benchmarks  including as measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
these measures are provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income controlling interest and earnings per share 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of any liquidity measures calculated under gaap 
under our economic net income definition  we add to net income controlling interest amortization including equity method amortization  deferred taxes related to intangible assets  non cash imputed interest expense principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements and affiliate equity expense 
we add back amortization attributable 
table of contents to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations 
we add back non cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between affiliate management partners  when these transfers have no dilutive effect to our shareholders 
economic earnings per share represents economic net income divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding  which measures the potential share issuance from our senior convertible securities and junior convertible securities each further described in liquidity and capital resources using a treasury stock method 
under this method  only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par  if any  are deemed to be outstanding 
we believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation 
this method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income controlling interest to economic net income in millions  except shares and per share data net income loss intangible amortization intangible related deferred taxes imputed interest affiliate equity expense affiliate depreciation economic net income average shares outstanding diluted assumed issuance of senior convertible securities shares assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares dilutive impact of options dilutive impact of mandatory convertible securities shares dilutive impact of senior convertible securities shares dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares average shares outstanding adjusted diluted economic earnings per share as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain of our investments and  as such  do not separately report these affiliates revenues or expenses including intangible amortization expenses in our income statement 
our share of these investments amortization  million  million and million for  and  respectively is reported in income loss from equity method investments 
our reported intangible amortization  million  million and million for  and  respectively  includes  million and million  respectively  of amortization attributable to our non controlling interests  amounts not added back to net income controlling interest to measure our economic net income 

table of contents our reported imputed interest expense  million  million and million for  and  respectively  includes  and million of imputed interest attributable to our non controlling interests  amounts not added back to net income controlling interest to measure our economic net income 
in connection with accounting changes adopted in  we modified our economic net income definition to add back non cash charges related to certain affiliate equity transfers referred to as affiliate equity expense and apb expense both net of tax 
in prior periods  economic net income was defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes relating to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
under this prior definition economic net income and economic earnings per share reported in were million and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we modified our economic net income definition to exclude non cash imputed interest and revaluation adjustments related to contingent payment arrangements from net income controlling interest  and in the fourth quarter of we further modified the definition to no longer add back affiliate depreciation to net income controlling interest 
if we had applied these definition changes to all periods presented above  economic net income would have been million  million and million and economic earnings per share would have been  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
economic net income increased in primarily as a result of the previously described factors that caused an increase in net income as well as increases in amortization and intangible related deferred tax expenses 
economic net income decreased in primarily as a result of the decreases in revenue  partially offset by an increase in investment and other income as well as decreases in reported operating  non controlling interest and tax expenses  as previously described 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt senior convertible notes zero coupon convertible notes junior convertible trust preferred securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our internal leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access additional capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider junior trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash 
at december   our internal leverage ratio was 
table of contents under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants 
the first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda the bank leverage ratio of x 
the calculation of our bank leverage ratio is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach 
the second covenant is a minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratio of x our bank interest coverage ratio 
as of december   our actual bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were and  respectively  and we were in full compliance with all terms of our credit facility 
we have million of remaining capacity under our million credit facility and we could borrow the entire amount and remain in compliance with our credit agreement 
we are rated bbb by both standard poor and fitch rating agencies 
with the exception of a modest increase in the borrowing rate under our credit facility  a downgrade of our credit rating would have no direct financial effect on any of our agreements or securities or otherwise trigger a default 
supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we provide information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operating activities 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry

table of contents in  we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  the settlement of forward equity sales and borrowings of senior bank debt 
our principal uses of cash were to make investments in new and existing affiliates  repay senior debt and make distributions to affiliate managers 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  and for working capital purposes

subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments  we have the option to increase the revolver by up to million 
the revolver contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends and fundamental corporate changes 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolver

in lieu of redemption  all of the holders elected to convert their zero coupon senior convertible notes into shares of our common stock 
we issued  shares of common stock to settle these conversions  and cancelled and retired the notes

we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities on or after october if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
holders of the and junior trust preferred securities have no rights to put these securities to us 
derivative instruments from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge 
we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on million of our debt 
these contracts expire between and under these contracts  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of through october and a weighted average fixed rate of on a remaining notional amount of million thereafter through october plus any applicable spread payable under our debt agreements 
as of december   the unrealized gain on these contracts was million 
we have also entered into treasury rate lock agreements with a notional value of million to hedge an anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt 
as of december   the unrealized gain on these agreements was million 
these contracts were settled in february 
table of contents forward equity sale agreement during  we entered into a forward equity sale agreement with a major securities firm to sell shares of our common stock 
as of december   no forward equity sales are outstanding and we may sell up to an additional million under this agreement 
affiliate equity many of our operating agreements provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
certain agreements also provide us a conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events 
the purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate cash flows  which is intended to represent fair value 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
we may pay for affiliate equity purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration and in all cases can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities 
the current redemption value for these interests has been presented as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate equity during  and  in such event  will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes  equity based compensation and depreciation  as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital 
the increase in cash flows from operations in as compared to  resulted principally from increases in net income of million  in income from equity method investments of million offset by an increase in distributions received from equity method investments of million  and in other adjustments of million  as well as a decrease in settlements of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
these increases in cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million  which reduced cash flows 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in as compared to resulted principally from a decrease in collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million  a decrease in other adjustments of million and a decrease in stock option expense of million 
investing cash flow changes in net cash flow used in investing activities result primarily from investments in new affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments in new affiliates was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these investments were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility  the issuance of equity including the settlement of forward equity sales and existing cash 
financing cash flow net cash flows from financing activities increased million in as compared to  primarily a result of an increase in net borrowings of senior bank debt of million as well as an 
table of contents increase in proceeds from the settlement of forward equity sales of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in repurchases of affiliate equity of million 
we used available cash and borrowings under our revolver to finance our investments in artemis and trilogy and issued shares of common stock for our aston investment 
we financed our pantheon investment with available cash  borrowings under our revolver  and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales 
net cash flows used in financing activities decreased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the settlement of a forward equity arrangement of million in the period and a decrease in issuance costs of million  partially offset by a million decrease in the distributions to non controlling interests during  we retired the outstanding floating rate convertible securities and issued approximately million shares of common stock 
additionally  we repurchased the outstanding senior notes component of our mandatory convertible securities 
the repurchase proceeds were used by the original holders to fulfill their obligations under the related forward equity purchase contracts 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock to settle the forward equity purchase contracts 
excess tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
under past acquisition agreements  we are contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make payments of up to million through in  we expect to make total payments of approximately million to settle portions of these contingent obligations and we expect to repurchase about million of interests in certain existing affiliates in we anticipate that borrowings under the revolver and proceeds from the settlement of any forward equity sales  together with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future

the amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest 
holders of the convertible notes may put their interests to us for million in as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
other liabilities reflect amounts payable to affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests and deferred purchase price 
this table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions or commitments to co invest in certain investment partnerships of million and million as of december  as we cannot predict when such obligations will be paid 
the amount of contingent payments related to business acquisitions disclosed in the table represents our expected settlement amounts 
the maximum settlement amount through is million  and million in periods thereafter 
market risk our revenue is derived primarily from advisory fees which are based on assets under management 
such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are affected  in part  by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we have fixed rates of interest on our senior convertible notes and on both issues of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility 
from time to time  we seek to manage our exposure to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   a change in the canadian dollar and british pound to us dollar exchange rates would result in an approximate million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates increased stockholders equity by million 
from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into derivative contracts as described on page we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net increase in the unrealized value of our derivative contracts of approximately million 

table of contents there can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments during the first quarter of  we adopted a new standard that requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
under the standard  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
this new standard has been deferred for certain entities that utilize the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies or that have the attributes of investment companies 
the adoption of the portions of this new standard that were not deferred did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
we make judgments to determine the fair value of certain assets  liabilities and equity investments when allocating the purchase price of our investments  when our contingent payment obligations are re measured  when we issue or repurchase equity interests in our affiliates and when we test our assets for impairment 
these judgments require us to make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our operating segments  indefinite and definite lived intangible assets  equity and cost method investments  contingent payment obligations and the fair value of non controlling interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions about the growth rates  profitability and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts  as well as valuation multiples  tax benefits  credit risk  interest rates and discount rates 
we consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to market transactions  and in certain instances consult with third party valuation experts 
if we used different assumptions  the effect may be material to our financial statements  as the carrying value of our intangible assets and related amortization and our equity and cost method investments could be stated differently and result in different impairment conclusions 
the use of different assumptions to value our contingent payment obligations and non controlling interests could change the amount of imputed interest and compensation expense  if any  we report 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually indentified and separately recognized 
our goodwill impairment tests are performed annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level in our case  our three operating segments  or more frequently  should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter and no impairments were identified and no events have required us to update our assessments 
for purposes of our test  the fair value of each reporting unit was measured by applying a market multiple to the estimated cash flow of the reporting unit  including cash flows attributable to non controlling interests 
management believes that the valuation inputs used to determine fair value of our reporting units are reasonable 
the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds their respective carrying values  the fair values of the mutual fund  high net worth and institutional reporting units are approximately  and greater than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the value of any of our reporting units would indicate that an impairment may exist 
indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts with registered investment companies that are sponsored by our affiliates 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each quarter  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life 
we perform indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
in this test we compare the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value  measuring value through a discounted cash flow analysis 
the key valuation assumptions include current and projected levels of assets under management in the relevant registered investment company  expenses attributable to these contracts and discount rates 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
the fair value of each of our indefinite lived intangible assets tested for impairment exceeds their respective carrying value by at least 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts acquired in an affiliate investment 
we monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them  if necessary 
we review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we perform definite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships 

table of contents in the fourth quarter  we performed our impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets exceeds their carrying value by at least 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the undiscounted cash flows underlying these assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
equity and cost method investments we evaluate equity and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
we measure the fair value of each of our investments by applying a market multiple to estimated cash flows of each investment 
our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of affiliate assets under management  fee rates and estimated expenses 
changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the fair value of these investments 
in the fourth quarter  we completed our evaluation of equity and cost method investments and no impairments were identified 
only a decline in excess of approximately in the fair value of certain of our equity and cost method investments for a period considered to be other than temporary would indicate that an impairment may exist 
redeemable non controlling interests redeemable non controlling interests represent the currently redeemable value of our affiliate partners retained equity interests 
we may pay for these affiliate equity purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration and have presented our obligation to repurchase these interests as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
we value these interests quarterly and upon their transfer or repurchase by applying market multiples to an affiliate cash flows  which is intended to represent fair value 
the use of different assumptions could change the value of these interests including the amount of compensation expense  if any  that we may report upon their transfer or repurchase 
imputed interest expense imputed interest expense results from accreting the carrying value of our convertible securities and contingent payment obligations to their expected payment amounts using market interest rates over the expected life of the obligations 
the expected payment amounts are based on the principal amount at maturity for convertible securities and our current estimate of payments to be made for contingent payment obligations such estimates being dependent upon growth rates and future earnings 
our interest rates are supported by observed transactions and input from valuation experts 
our expected lives are determined based on the contractual terms of the underlying obligations 
changes in the expected payment amounts of our contingent payment obligations could materially affect the amount of imputed interest expense we recognize in any period 
income taxes tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our overall tax position requires analysis to 
table of contents estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and convertible securities 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments to be taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
we generally believe that our intangible related deferred tax liabilities are unlikely to be used to settle a cash obligation 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these deductions may be permanent 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment 
we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment was approximately million 
during  our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense 
these deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity if the securities convert to common stock 
we regularly assess our deferred tax assets in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
our principal deferred tax assets are state operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
in our assessment  we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   our valuation allowances for state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
in our assessment of uncertain tax positions  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering directors  senior management and employees 
we recognize share based compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options 
in determining expected volatility  we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as the current implied volatility from traded securities 
in measuring volatility and expected life  we may place less emphasis on periods that are not representative of our future expectations 
our options typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment and do not include performance based or market based vesting conditions 
for grants that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

table of contents in  the compensation committee of our board of directors implemented a long term equity interests plan providing us with an additional long term retention tool designed to align incentives with the creation of shareholder value 
under the plan  equity interests may be granted to our management from time to time  with vesting  forfeiture and repurchase agreements established under the plan and by the compensation committee at the time of grant 
the value of awards is determined as of the date of grant using a discounted cash flow analysis 
key valuation assumptions include projected assets under management and fee rates  and discount rates utilizing industry market data and historical experience in making these assumptions 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  over affiliate products  representing approximately billion of assets under management  also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance performance fees 
our affiliates recognize performance fees when they are earned ie when they become billable to customers based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured 
international operations in connection with our international distribution initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia  london  england and hong kong 
in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
