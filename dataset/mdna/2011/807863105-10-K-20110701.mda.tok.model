we do not undertake to update any forward looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of us  in this annual report or otherwise 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
our business depends upon the growth of the student population and school expenditures and can be adversely impacted by fixed or declining school budgets 
our growth strategy and profitability depend in part on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in prek schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are affected by federal  state and local government budgets 
for example  from to  the industry was negatively affected by a generally weakened economic environment which placed pressure on some state and local budgets  the primary sources of school funding 
this was evidenced  among other things  by the decline in state tax revenue in in addition  the current macroeconomic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced school budgets 
in school districts in states that primarily rely on local tax proceeds for funding  significant reductions in those proceeds for any reason can restrict district expenditures and impact our results of operations 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because school budgets are fixed on a yearly basis  any shift by schools in expenditures during a given fiscal year to areas that are not part of our business  such as facility operating costs and employee related expenditures  could also materially affect our business 
the negative global macroeconomic conditions could impact the education funding provided by state and local governments 
the weakened economic environment has placed increased pressure on state and local government budgets  which are the primary source of school funding 
the global economy is currently suffering from the effects of the latest recession which has led to a decline in consumer and business spending and confidence 
this has resulted in our customers delaying or cutting school expenditures as the recession creates state and local budget deficits and uncertainty about future economic funding by state and local governments 
the federal stimulus funds that were provided by the federal government to school districts helped education funding in  but these federal funds have been fully distributed and many states have not been able to replace them due to declining state revenue 
significant and sustained declines in the per student funding levels provided for in state and local budgets  and delays or decreases in spending by our customers due to concerns about potential or actual declines in funding levels  could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a continued decline in school spending will impact our ability to maintain operating margins 
we have seen a decline in our operating margin in fiscal as a result of the continued school spending cuts and our revenue decline 
the company will continue to aggressively pursue further cost reductions if school spending continues to decline  but the company will not cut costs in areas that it believes could have a significant impact on future revenue growth 
to the extent we are unable to identify additional cost reductions that can be made consistent with our strategy and the weakness in school spending persists  our operating margin may decline 
additionally  spending declines can cause schools to consider purchasing lower priced products which will lower the company s margins 
increased costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products would adversely affect our results of operations 
higher than expected costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products could affect our results of operations 
to the extent we incur difficulties or higher than expected costs related to updating our distribution centers  such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in our ability to service our customers may also impact our revenues or profits 
moreover  as we update our distribution model or change the product mix of our distribution centers  we may encounter unforeseen costs or difficulties that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
our business is highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year  we record most of our revenues from june to october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of orders for our products so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
to the extent we do not sell our products to schools during the peak shipping season  many of such sales opportunities will be lost and will not be available in subsequent quarters 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality causes our operating results and operating cash flows to vary considerably from quarter to quarter within our fiscal years 
if our key suppliers or service providers were unable to provide the products and services we require  our business could be adversely affected 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture and proprietary products 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through october  our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our agreements with our suppliers are terminable at any time or on short notice  with or without cause  and  while we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good  we cannot assure that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect 
our business is highly competitive 
the market for supplemental educational products and equipment is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market supplemental educational products and equipment to schools with prek as a primary focus of their business 
we also face competition from alternate channel marketers  including office supply superstores  office product contract stationers  and purchasing cooperatives that have not traditionally focused on marketing supplemental educational products and equipment 
our competitors impact the prices we are able to charge and we expect to continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors in the future  especially on our commodity type products 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in supplemental educational products and equipment 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the supplemental educational products and equipment market will consolidate over the next several years  which could increase competition in both our markets and our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
we also face increased competition and pricing pressure as a result of the accessibility of the internet 
if any of our key personnel discontinue their role with us  our business could be adversely affected 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his or her role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel and qualified employees  our business could be adversely affected 
we have employment contracts with many of our key officers 
other than the life insurance we have in place for our chief executive officer  we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of our management 
a failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our operations and growth opportunities 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and we may not be successful in implementing our strategy 
this includes limitations due to the inability to obtain financing and or the restrictiveness of our debt covenants 
in addition  the implementation of our strategy may not lead to improved operating results 
we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors not currently expected  such as unforeseen costs and expenses or events beyond our control 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth opportunities 
we face risks associated with our increasing emphasis on imported goods and private label products 
increases in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods may adversely impact our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
our business strategy includes an increased emphasis on offering private label products and sourcing quality merchandise directly from low cost suppliers 
as a result  we expect to rely more heavily on imported goods from china and other countries and we expect the sale of imported goods to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
to the extent we rely more heavily on the sale of private label products  our potential exposure to product liability claims may increase 
in addition  our reputation may become more closely tied to our private label products and may suffer to the extent our customers are not satisfied with the quality of such products 
private label products will also increase our risks associated with returns and inventory obsolescence 
our reliance on imported merchandise subjects us to a number of risks  including a increased difficulties in ensuring quality control  b disruptions in the flow of imported goods due to factors such as raw material shortages  work stoppages  strikes  and political unrest in foreign countries  c problems with oceanic shipping  including shipping container shortages  d economic crises and international disputes  e increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from a failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and the other countries we do business in  f import duties  import quotas  and other trade sanctions  and g increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans pacific shipping cartel 
if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable  we may not be able to transition to alternative sources in time to meet our demands 
a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods due to these or other factors would significantly decrease our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
currency exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
to the extent we source merchandise from overseas manufacturers and sell products internationally  exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to service our us dollar denominated debt 
the majority of our debt is in us dollars while a portion of our revenue is derived from imported products and international sales 
therefore  fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies versus the us dollar could impact our costs and revenues 
in addition  for the purposes of financial reporting  any change in the value of the foreign currencies against the us dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain 
consequently  our reported earnings could fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange translation and may not be comparable from period to period 
it is difficult to forecast our revenue stream given the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers and delays in passage of state budgets 
the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  the fact that our customers typically purchase products on an as needed basis  and the lack of visibility to education funding levels if state budgets are delayed make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue stream  which may vary significantly from period to period 
financial analysts and others that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties 
the difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue increases the likelihood that our financial results will differ materially from any projected financial results 
any shortfall in our financial results from our  or third party  projected results could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and our convertible subordinated notes 
if we are unable to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant amount of our past growth has come from acquisitions 
future growth in our revenues and earnings will be impacted by our ability to continue to acquire and successfully integrate businesses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth may be limited  or our revenues could decline 
in addition  the integration of acquired businesses with our existing business operations presents many challenges and can demand significant attention from our key managers 
the demands placed upon the time of our management team may adversely affect the operation of our existing business 
managing and integrating acquired businesses may result in substantial costs  delays  or other operating or financial problems that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
key risks in making acquisitions involve failure to execute as well or as quickly as anticipated on our integration plans  including the integration of acquired employees  operations  technologies and products with our existing business and products  ineffective due diligence process on acquired business  retention of business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  loss of key personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of our management during the integration process  and resistance to cultural changes in the acquired organization 
we have a material amount of goodwill  other intangible assets which were written down 
at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
we are required to evaluate whether our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets have been impaired on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million related to goodwill and an indefinite lived tradename intangible  respectively  in the first quarter of fiscal the impairment was determined as part of the fair value assessment of these assets 
reductions in our net income caused by any additional write down of our goodwill or intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a material amount of capitalized product development costs which might be written down 
in addition  we had capitalized product development costs of million and million at april  and april   respectively  related to internally developed  which are amortized to expense over the lesser of five years or the product s life cycle 
any changes in the estimated sales volume or life cycle of the underlying products could cause the currently capitalized costs or costs capitalized in the future to be impaired 
our operations are dependent on our information systems 
we have integrated the operations of most of our divisions and subsidiaries  which operate on systems located at both our greenville  wisconsin  headquarters and our third party hosted erp system provider s facilities 
in addition  there are divisions running legacy systems hosted at their locations 
all systems rely on continuous telecommunication connections to the main computers 
if any of these connections becomes disrupted  or unavailable  for an extended period of time  the disruption could materially and adversely affect our business  operations and financial performance 
we also continue to introduce new information systems to achieve a common processing infrastructure for all of our businesses  particularly the new erp platform described elsewhere in this report  which will displace existing legacy systems 
as we implement the new systems  there is the potential for disruptions if the new systems do not perform as expected 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from unexpected events that could interrupt new  existing and acquired business operations and systems  we cannot be sure that fire  flood or other natural disasters would not disable our systems and or prevent them from communicating between business segments 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also face challenges in integrating the information systems of any companies we acquire 
the costs associated with performing such integrations or any disruptions resulting from a failure to successfully make any such integration could materially impact our business 
we rely on our intellectual property in the design and marketing of our products 
we rely on certain trademarks  trade names and service names  along with licenses to use and exploit certain trademarks  trade names and service names collectively  the marks in the design and marketing of some of our products 
we could lose our ability to use our brands if our marks were found to be generic or non descriptive 
while no single mark is material to our business  the termination of a number of these marks could have an adverse effect on our business 
we also rely on certain copyrights  patents and licenses other than those described above  the termination of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business  could prohibit us from engaging in transactions we believe to be beneficial and could lead to the acceleration of our debt and or an increased cost of capital 
our existing and future debt agreements impose and may impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities 
these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  create liens  make acquisitions  redeem and or prepay certain debt  sell or dispose of a minority equity interest in any subsidiary or other assets  make capital expenditures  make certain investments  enter new lines of business  engage in consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  guarantee obligations  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and pay dividends and make other distributions 
our amended senior credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a total leverage ratio  a senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions  and other corporate opportunities 
in the event that we fail to comply with the financial ratios contained in our amended and restated credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our amended and restated credit facility 
also  should there be an event of default  or need to obtain waivers following an event of default  we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and or more restrictive covenants in future periods

background we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  programs and services that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our goal is to grow profitably as a leading provider of supplemental education products 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
although we experienced revenue declines in each of the last three fiscal years due primarily to the significant impact the current macroeconomic conditions have had on school spending  historically  we have grown through a combination of acquisitions and internal investments that drive organic growth 
in the past few years  our growth strategies have been focused primarily on the curriculum based supplemental products  and we expect that this focus will continue in the foreseeable future 
while the number of acquisitions that we have completed has declined in the past three years  acquisitions remain a key strategy for us 
our future acquisition plans are focused primarily on acquiring curriculum based products in disciplines where the company s current product offerings do not have the desired breadth and depth 
in addition  the company is committed to continuing to invest in its internal product development efforts in order to expand current offerings such as its science and reading intervention curricula 
these growth plans  both through acquisitions and internal product development  will be mainly focused on curriculum based products because these types of products provide a competitive advantage in their proprietary nature  and have typically provided greater profit margins to the company 
the company s annual revenue growth from curriculum based products has been and will continue to be impacted by the cyclical nature of state adoptions of these products 
our state adoption revenue will continue to have significant variability between years due to the adoption schedules established by the individual states 
the company also remains committed to its commodity type products and  while its acquisition strategy is more focused on curriculum based supplemental products  the company continues to invest resources towards increasing the company s market share for these commodity type products 
our gross margin has decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from higher price discounts within the educational resources segment during fiscal in response to more competitive pricing with the market 
product mix has an impact on consolidated gross margins as the accelerated learning segment has traditionally experienced higher revenue growth than the educational resources segment 
also  the year to year variation in state adoption revenue  which is typically higher gross margin product  will have an impact on gross margin between years 
our operating income from continuing operations was million  million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  our operating loss and margin were million and respectively 
the primary decrease in operating income is due to the goodwill and intangible asset non cash impairment charge of million the company recorded in the first quarter of fiscal due to the significance of the impairment charge in fiscal  the company believes it is more meaningful to compare operating income and margin from continuing operations excluding the impairment charge to prior years operating income and margin from continuing operations 
excluding the impact of the impairment charge  the company s operating income and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
the company s business results have been negatively impacted by the recent downturn in the economy 
the current economic conditions resulted in revenue and profitability declines as cautious spending by schools and teachers and growing state budget deficits have created uncertainty as to upcoming education funding levels from the states 
in response to this uncertainty around education funding  a potential period of reduced spending by schools and the uncertainty of the duration of any such reduction  all of which negatively impacted our revenues  the company initiated a significant expense reduction plan beginning in fiscal in order to better balance expenses and product costs with potentially lower revenue 
these expense reduction plans were accomplished through a combination of facility closures  furloughs  functional department consolidations that resulted in staff reductions and improvements in our control of product costs through negotiations with some of the company s larger vendors 
these cost savings partially offset the revenue shortfall caused by the weakened economy 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the continued downturn in the economy and cautious spending by schools and districts pointed to an impairment triggering event at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the company had year over year revenue and gross profit declines in excess of during the first quarter of fiscal and its cost reduction activities could not keep pace with these steeper than expected declines 
the company recorded a million and million impairment related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the impairment charge recorded for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the continued downturn in the economy as well as cautious spending by schools and districts also has had a negative effect on the company s investment in carson dellosa publishing  llc carson dellosa 
the company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate a potential impairment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company evaluated its investment in carson dellosa for impairment and recorded a million other than temporary impairment in other income expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
carson dellosa is an unconsolidated affiliate in which the company has a ownership interest as described below 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the impairment charge recorded for the investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal  with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as expected  the fiscal back to school season was a difficult period as school funding remained under pressure 
as such  the company had a revenue decline of approximately but is cautiously optimistic that school spending will begin to rebound in fiscal this optimism is based on modest improvements in the company s order rates for both segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal as revenue holds steady or increases into fiscal  the company s ability to improve operating margins will be challenged as the company begins to invest in the business through sg a

overview of fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal the educational resources and accelerated learning segments experienced revenue declines of and in fiscal  respectively 
the revenue declines in both the educational resources and the accelerated learning segments were attributable primarily to the current macroeconomic conditions and the impact those conditions have had on state budget funding levels 
according to the national bureau of economic research  state revenue collections underperformed forecasts during the latest recession 
since approximately of school funding is provided by states  the company believes the decreased state revenues are adversely affecting school funding and the related spending by schools 
the company is cautiously optimistic that the funding cycle may be the bottom of the school spending decline 
state revenues  a key component of school funding  are projected to begin to rise in  according to the national conference of state legislatures 
also contributing to the revenue decline in the supplies category within educational resources were execution issues in the company s pricing and bid strategies 
the company believes is has corrected both the pricing and bid strategies 
despite the decline in funding levels  the company believes it can grow revenues by increasing market share 
approximately of the revenue decline in the accelerated learning segment was attributable to the fiscal divestiture of the school specialty publishing ssp business unit 
the remaining decline is attributable to the school funding constraints which the company believes are leading to school districts lengthening the decision making cycles for curriculum purchases 
competitive pressures have resulted in more significant price discounting  especially in the furniture and supply categories 
gross margin decreased basis points to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decreased gross margin was related primarily to competitive pricing pressures in the educational resources segment 
the company expects this gross margin degradation to lessen in fiscal as it begins to implement new pricing programs

we recorded million of pre tax impairment charges in the first quarter of fiscal primarily to reduce the carrying value of goodwill of the education resources reporting unit  which is part of the educational resources segment  and the science and planning and student development reporting units  which are part of the accelerated learning segment 
the company experienced a significant decline in revenue and operating income in the first quarter  as education spending continued to suffer from the ongoing economic downturn 
this  coupled with the decline in the company s market capitalization during the first quarter of fiscal  led to the determination during that period that goodwill and an indefinite lived tradename were impaired

the decline in educational resources segment revenue was comprised of a decline of approximately million in the administrator and educator supplies product lines and a decline of approximately million in the furniture product lines 
the decline in the supplies category revenue was related to reductions in school spending as a result of on going school funding issues  as well as execution issues in the company s pricing and bid strategy 
the company estimates that these execution issues resulted in approximately million of the revenue decline in the supplies category 
the decline in the furniture category revenue was a result of the continued weakness in the school construction activity 
while the company does not anticipate any significant near term improvement in school construction activity  the company had an increase in orders for loose furniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal which the company believes is an indicator of increasing market share 
decreased prices in response to competitive pressures in the high volume commodity supplies and furniture categories contributed approximately million of revenue decline for the segment 
accelerated learning segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which is comprised of solely sales from external parties 
the divestiture of ssp accounted for million of the decline 
the acquisition of autoskill  acquired in the second quarter of fiscal added million of revenue in the first half of fiscal the remaining decrease of million is a result of customer spending declines across all education categories due to education spending cuts by states  which the company believes are affecting school districts spending decisions on purchasing new curriculum based materials

gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline in gross margin was related to higher price discounting in the furniture and high volume commodity supply categories 
the company expects the rate of decline in gross margin to lessen in upcoming quarters of fiscal as pricing issues have been addressed for the current back to school season 
accelerated learning segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in the gross profit  had segment gross margin remained constant 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal resulted in a million decrease in gross profit 
the decrease in gross margin is a result of unfavorable product mix shift

impairment the impact of macro economic conditions on school spending negatively impacted the fiscal back to school season 
declines in the company s current operating results and projections that fiscal results will be in line with recent results while the economy and school spending recover have significantly changed the company s projected cash flows used in the goodwill assessment as compared to prior year cash flow estimates 
as a result of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests  the company concluded in its assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the first quarter of fiscal that the carrying value amounts of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value 
the goodwill impairment charge was million  which consisted of million  million  and million for the educational resources  science  and planning and student development reporting units  respectively 
these goodwill impairment charges were determined by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
an additional impairment of million in the first quarter was related to an indefinite lived tradename intangible 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal net interest expense net interest expense decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease in interest expense was related to the decreased non cash interest expense associated with the convertible notes offset by an increase in the company s overall effective borrowing rate from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase in the effective borrowing rate was primarily related to the increased commitment fees in the company s existing credit facility as compared to its previous facility and an increased rate on the company s average borrowings 
the commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit facility during the fiscal year were approximately basis points as compared to approximately basis points in the prior year 
this increased interest expense by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal other expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into exchange agreements with holders of million in aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible debentures due that were originally issued in in the exchange for their old debentures  the holders received new debentures with changes to the conversion  put and premium features 
the company incurred million in issuance costs in conjunction with this exchange transaction 
these costs have been expensed in fiscal the company recorded an impairment of its equity method investment in carson dellosa in the fourth quarter of fiscal the value of the company s ownership interest in the entity was evaluated in light of the impact that school spending declines have had on the projected cash flows of the equity investment 
the decline in current and projected cash flows is resulting in the value of the company s ownership interest to be less than the company s carrying amount by million 
this write down has been reflected in other expense 
there was no write down in fiscal the company s share of the loss from this equity method investment is reflected in the losses of unconsolidated affiliate 
provision for benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes was million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the current year income tax benefit includes million of income tax benefit related to the million goodwill and non amortizable asset impairment 
approximately million of the goodwill impairment was related to non deductible goodwill associated with past stock acquisitions for which a tax benefit was not recorded 
the remaining goodwill and intangible asset impairment generated the million of tax benefit 
due to the significant impact the impairment charge had on the effective tax rate  the company believes the tax benefit and the effective tax rate excluding the million impairment charge are more meaningful comparisons to last year s comparable period 
excluding this goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  the tax benefit for fiscal was million as compared to a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal the decline is related to the decrease in earnings before tax 
excluding this goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge  the effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate is related primarily to the impact of the permanent items and state taxes on a lower tax base 
the effective income tax rate of exceeds the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased to million as compared to billion in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced a significant decline in revenue as the macroeconomic conditions created uncertainty in the school districts related to state budget funding levels 
this decline continued in fiscal as school budgets came under more pressure  which in turn  has led to cautious spending by our customers  especially in the furniture product lines within the educational resources segment  which accounted for well over one half of the segment s revenue decline 
the decrease was also related to a decrease in state adoption revenue derived from the company s science curriculum based offering 
the company s overall revenue mix shifted toward the educational resources segment  with the segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal gross margins in the segment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was attributable to net price increases in excess of product cost increases as the segment executed on its initiatives to better align its pricing structure with product costs as well as a product mix shift towards administrator and educator supplies products within the educational resources segment  which carry higher gross margins than furniture products 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income was a result of macroeconomic conditions in fiscal and reductions in fiscal school spending due to the uncertainty in education funding levels and state budgetary concerns 
the operating margin increase was a result of both gross margin improvements and expense reductions resulting from compensation related decisions  headcount reductions  operational consolidations and restructuring and other cost control initiatives 
revenue revenues decreased from billion in fiscal to million in fiscal  which was attributable to declines in both the educational resources and accelerated learning segments 
educational resources segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue amounts for both periods were comprised solely of sales to external parties 
the decline in educational resources segment revenue was comprised of a decline of approximately million  or approximately  in the administrator and educator supplies product lines and a decline of approximately million  or approximately  in the furniture product lines 
these declines were most directly attributable to the ongoing weakened economic conditions which we believe have negatively impacted school purchasing decisions 
this was particularly noticeable in those states which have been more seriously affected by the economic decline  such as california  florida  illinois  and michigan 
the company believes that its cost cutting initiatives partially contributed to the revenue decline through elimination of catalogs and the back office consolidations that affected marketing and selling efforts 
the larger decline in furniture product line is reflective of the fact that those purchases are more discretionary in nature and economic conditions led to reductions in school construction and renovation activities 
accelerated learning segment revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues 
approximately million of the decline in accelerated learning segment revenue was due to the decrease in state adoption revenue of the company s curriculum based products  primarily in the state of california  which the company had anticipated would occur 
in addition  the company s divestiture of its retail trade book business  school specialty publishing  resulted in a revenue decline of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offsetting this decline was incremental revenue of million related to the company s acquisition of autoskill 
the remaining decline of approximately million  or approximately  was attributable to the impact that the downturn in the general economic conditions has had on school districts spending decisions 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit had consolidated gross margin remained constant offset by million of gross margin increases 
gross margin increased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was related to gross margin increases in both segments  as further discussed below 
partially offsetting the gross margin increase was approximately basis points of gross margin decline related to the mix of revenue between segments 
the accelerated learning segment  which generates higher margin than the educational resources segment  accounted for of the consolidated revenue in fiscal as compared to of the consolidated revenue in fiscal educational resources segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in approximately million of the decline in gross profit had segment gross margin remained constant 
partially offsetting the decline was approximately million of incremental gross profit related to an increase of basis points in segment gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately basis points of the gross margin improvement was related to the company s pricing initiatives which resulted in price increases in excess of product cost increases 
this includes the impact of lower transportation costs which were related to the decreased fuel costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remaining gross margin improvement of approximately basis points was a result of product mix 
during fiscal  the revenue shifted to more consumable products versus furniture  and the consumable products generate a higher gross margin than the furniture products 
accelerated learning segment gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in segment revenue resulted in million of the decline in gross profit  had segment gross margin remained constant 
the decline was offset by an increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue of basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal  which increased gross profit by million 
the increase in gross margin was a result of favorable product mix shift within the segment  primarily related to the incremental revenue from the autoskill acquisition  a higher margin business due to the software content of its products  which increased gross margin by approximately basis points 
the remaining increase was related primarily to the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business in fiscal  which generated lower gross margin than the segment s overall gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of revenues increased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal sg a decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the sg a reduction was attributable to compensation related decisions during the year including  suspension of a company k match  reduction in incentives  and a furlough for all employees 
in addition  overall full time employment declined by approximately associates  or  in fiscal  which translates into approximately million in compensation related cost reductions 
sg a attributable to the educational resources and accelerated learning segments decreased a combined million and corporate sg a decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percent of revenue  educational resources segment sg a increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percent of revenue was attributable to the fixed cost portion of sg a being spread over a smaller revenue base 
educational resources segment sg a decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment experienced a decrease of approximately million in its variable sg a costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues 
the segment s portion of the savings from the above mentioned compensation related decisions was approximately million 
decreases in catalog circulation and the elimination of redundant catalog offerings contributed to a million decline in catalog costs 
improvements in the current year fill rate for warehouse shipments has translated into approximately million of operational efficiency in both warehouse and transportation 
the improved fill rate reduced the number of backorders 
the remaining decline was related primarily to the compensation savings associated with headcount reductions resulting from operational consolidations 
as a percent of sales  accelerated learning segment sg a increased from in fiscal to in fiscal accelerated learning segment sg a decreased million  or from in fiscal to million in fiscal the segment experienced a decrease of approximately million in its variable sg a costs such as transportation  warehousing  and selling expenses associated with decreased revenues 
the segment s portion of savings from the above mentioned compensation related decisions was approximately million 
the divestiture of the school specialty publishing business led to a million decrease in sg a  which was largely offset by the acquisition of autoskill  which increased sg a by million 
the remaining reduction is related primarily to compensation savings associated with headcount reductions 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue was due to the base non variable costs in comparison to decreased revenue 
corporate sg a decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of the million decrease in corporate sg a  approximately million was related to the above mentioned compensation related decisions  approximately million was related to fiscal expense incurred for the closing of the lyons  new york distribution center and approximately million was due to stock based compensation expense 
corporate also had a million dollar decrease in marketing expense as some corporate marketing associates were moved into the segments 
the remaining corporate sg a decrease was related primarily to the lower compensation and benefit costs associated with headcount reductions 
these headcount reductions were a function of a combination of back office consolidation as well as staffing reductions made to address the revenue decline 
net interest expense on april   the company adopted fasb asc topic  debt with conversion and other options 
net interest expense including the impact of the adoption of fasb asc topic was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the non cash interest related to the adoption of fasb asc topic was million in fiscal compared to in fiscal a reduction in the overall effective borrowing rate from in fiscal to in fiscal reduced interest expense by approximately million 
an million dollar decrease in the company s average outstanding borrowings in fiscal as compared to fiscal contributed approximately million of interest expense decrease 
partially offsetting the decreases was million of additional debt issuance amortization mainly related to the early retirement of the company s prior amended and restated credit agreement  which was replaced with a new credit agreement in april other expense other expense  which primarily consists of the discount and loss on the company s accounts receivable securitization  was in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the non renewal of the company s securitization facility  which expired on january  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of in both years primarily due to the impact of state and foreign taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at april   the company had negative working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million and consisted of debt of million and shareholders equity of million 
on february   the company amended its credit agreement to provide greater flexibility on financial covenant ratios to allow the company to continue to invest in its initiatives and to provide flexibility related to the refinancing of its convertible subordinated notes 
the amendment  among other things  reduced the overall credit facility capacity from million to million  with the ability to convert up to million of the revolving commitment to a delayed draw term loan to be used to refinance the company s convertible notes 
covenant modifications included increases in both the total and senior leverage ratios  while the facility s interest rate will generally increase basis points on borrowings  depending on company leverage 
the company s credit facility matures on april  and  as amended  provides for million of availability  which consists of million of a revolving loan and a delayed draw term loan of up to million 
the delayed draw term loan can be used to refinance a portion of the company s convertible debt 
in certain circumstances  unused amounts on the delayed draw term loan can be converted to availability on the revolver 
the amount outstanding as of april  under the revolving and incremental term loans was million and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
during fiscal  the company borrowed under our credit facility primarily to meet seasonal working capital requirements 
the company s borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of the fiscal year to meet the working capital requirements of our peak selling season 
as of april   the company s effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was  which excludes amortization of loan origination fee costs and the commitment fees on unborrowed funds 
during fiscal  the company paid commitment fees on unborrowed funds under the credit facility of million and amortized loan origination fee costs of million related to the credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a consolidated total and senior leverage ratio  a consolidated fixed charge ratio and a limitation on consolidated capital expenditures and places certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock 
the company was in compliance with these covenants and restrictions at april  the company closely evaluates its expected ability to remain in compliance with the consolidated total leverage and interest coverage ratios due to the ratios sensitivity to the company s financial results 
the recent economic trends impacting the company s performance  such as the decline in school funding which had led to a decrease in the company s revenues and margins  have put pressure on the company s ability to remain in compliance with these ratios 
based on current forecasts reflected in our most recent guidance  the company may be unable to maintain compliance with one or both of these financial covenants during fiscal the company may need to work with its lenders to secure a waiver or amend such ratios in the near future 
any amendment or waiver would result in additional bank fees and more restrictive terms  and may increase the cost of any future borrowings

net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million in fiscal to million for fiscal the decline in net income  adjusted for the after tax impact of non cash items is contributing approximately million to the decline in operating cash flow 
the retirement of and exchange of convertible debt resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of approximately million  which reduced operating cash flow net of accrued or refundable income taxes  by million 
partially offsetting this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was year over year working capital improvements  particularly in accounts payable net of inventory increases 
working capital decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the change in working capital is primarily due to the million increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payable is due to planned inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the upcoming back to school season as well as extended payment terms with vendors 
the company was also able to reduce its accounts receivable in fiscal the company s accounts receivable balances declined by million due to improved collections which is reflected in a reduction in day s sales outstanding by days 
inventories increased million due to advanced purchases to avoid price increases from vendors as well as the build up for the selling season 
accrued liabilities increased by approximately million primarily due to accrued income taxes as of the fiscal year ended april  net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to three transactions in fiscal the company used cash for the million and million purchase price acquisition of autoskill and thinkmath tm  respectively 
in addition the company received million during fiscal attributable to the sale of the company s lyons  new york facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million in net cash used in financing activities is attributable to million of debt outstanding on the company s revolving credit facility in fiscal as compared to in fiscal offset by the company s redemption of its million convertible subordinated notes due in the second quarter of fiscal as well as a reduction of cash used in investing activities

purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
common stock acquired through the share repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes 
however  the company s amended credit facility limits the company s ability to repurchase shares of its common stock 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures  share repurchases and our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million and to consist primarily of software costs related to the continued implementation of the new erp platform and warehouse management costs 
we expect our investment in product development to be approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s accounts receivable securitization facility expired january  and the company elected to not renew the facility due to the significant cost increases in accounts receivable asset backed securities markets compared to the costs of other sources of liquidity available to the company 
the company had originally entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing the company s variable rate interest expense 
however  in the current rate environment  the facility was not providing any material reduction in the company s variable rate interest expense and a renewed facility would have actually resulted in an increase to the company s variable rate interest expense 
the facility permitted advances up to million from july through november of each year  and advances up to million from december through june of each year 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for the fiscal year were the decrease in these costs was related to a combination of decreased discount rates and the termination of the securitization facility 
these costs are included as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations

the company s short term purchase obligations as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay  collectability is reasonably assured and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book  video or other media  on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in development costs and other  net  on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with science and reading intervention businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized development costs of million to expense related to our continuing businesses 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
goodwill and intangible assets  and long lived assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
we review our goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other options 
as required by fasb asc topic  the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment  which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by fasb asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
key assumptions used in the impairment analysis include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  business plan projections  revenue growth rates  and the discount rate utilized for discounting such cash flows 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million related to goodwill and an indefinite lived tradename intangible  respectively  in connection with the reconsideration event at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the impairment was determined as part of the fair value assessment of these assets 
indicators of impairment that were identified during the assessment were a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and a decline in our expected future cash flows 
the company s market capitalization declined approximately during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the decline in expected future cash flows was related to the continued deteriorating economic conditions that we believe have resulted in decreased funding of education which  in turn  has caused schools to reduce spending levels 
these reductions led to a revenue decline in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the first quarter of fiscal during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company reviewed both its current market capitalization and future cash flow projections and concluded no evidence of further impairment existed 
we tested goodwill for impairment by determining the fair value of the company s reporting units using a combined income discounted cash flow and market approach guideline public company comparables valuation model 
the details regarding the determination of the fair value of the reporting units  including the key assumptions used in the impairment analysis  are discussed in item  note of this report 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
during the first quarter fiscal impairment analysis  the company determined that its education resources  science and planning and student development reporting units had goodwill balances that were impaired 
the fair value assessment of the two remaining reporting units with goodwill balances  califone and reading  indicated that the goodwill balances of these two reporting units were not impaired as the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the units 
since the modification of assumptions used in the valuation model can have a significant impact on the fair value  the company performed a sensitivity analysis for the califone and reading reporting units 
this analysis was completed assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate and a basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate 
the company believes these assumptions have the most sensitivity in the valuation model 
the results of this sensitivity analysis are as follows decrease in fv of reading califone basis point increase in discount rate basis point decrease in terminal growth rate because the valuation of the reading and califone reporting units concluded the fair value exceeded carrying value by  and  respectively  the decreases in fair value for the sensitivity analysis would not have impaired the goodwill assessment of these two reporting units 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to have averaged basis points higher during fiscal and fiscal  pre tax earnings would have decreased by approximately million and million respectively 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding 
the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april  and april   with the exception of our convertible debt  which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million  and at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
