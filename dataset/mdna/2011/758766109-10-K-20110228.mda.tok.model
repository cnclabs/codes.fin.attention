item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows of regal entertainment group for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which concentrates on in theatre advertising and creating complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel  asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners  which include us  amc and cinemark 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs  our gift card and discount ticket programs and various other activities in our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors  including the prospects of a film  the popularity and box office revenues of a film  and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
the company revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence or continuance of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company results of operations  and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of other industry trends as well as other risks and uncertainties relevant to the company  see business industry overview and trends and risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note 
table of contents to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under current purchase accounting principles  we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition including contingencies  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value 
the company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date  including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities 
the company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained 
the company then uses the information to determine fair value 
the third party valuation firms are supervised by company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a 
table of contents few weeks after the film is released based on the film initial box office performance  which is determined by a film initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
to the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent  we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
for example  currently the company is focusing on an accelerated deployment of d compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run us theatres 
with respect to the company existing mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with digital projection systems  the company has begun to accelerate depreciation on such mm film projection equipment over the expected deployment schedule since the company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of their useful lives 
to that end  during the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded approximately million of accelerated depreciation related to such mm film projection equipment  as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties have been appraised 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased 
table of contents by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million  or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million  or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
a decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of asc subtopic  income taxes overview 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with asc subtopic  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
significant events and fiscal outlook during the fiscal years ended december  fiscal period  december  fiscal period and january  fiscal period  the company entered into various financing transactions which are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources financing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
on march   dcip executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection 
dcip financing raised million  consisting 
table of contents of million in senior bank debt  million in additional junior capital and approximately million in equity contributions consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems from us  amc and cinemark 
as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources investing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  concurrent with closing  the company entered into the digital cinema agreements with kasima  llc  and made the dcip contributions 
after giving effect to the dcip contributions  the company holds a economic interest in dcip as of december   while continuing to maintain a one third voting interest along with each of amc and cinemark 
as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources investing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  during the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  the company received an additional million newly issued common units of national cinemedia 
in addition  during the fiscal period  we redeemed approximately million of our national cinemedia common units for a like number of shares of ncm  inc common stock  which we sold in an underwritten public offering for per share  reducing our investment in national cinemedia by million  the average carrying amount of the shares sold 
we received approximately million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us  resulting in an aggregate gain on sale of million 
these transactions  together with national cinemedia issuance of million common units to amc in the second quarter of as a result of an acquisition  had the effect of decreasing the company ownership share in national cinemedia 
as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of december  on may  and june   the company acquired eight theatres with screens located in illinois  indiana and colorado from an affiliate of amc 
regal purchased five of these amc theatres representing screens for approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  and acquired the other three amc theatres representing screens in exchange for two regal theatres consisting of screens 
the results of operations of the eight acquired theatres have been included in the company consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates 
see liquidity and capital resources investing activities below and note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of this acquisition 
during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million  including an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock 
in addition to the eight theatres representing screens acquired from an affiliate of amc  we opened two new theatres with screens and closed theatres with screens including the two theatres exchanged with amc  ending the fiscal period with theatres and  screens 
we continued to embrace new technologies to deliver a premium movie going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts during the fiscal period  the company focused on an accelerated deployment of d compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run us theatres and expects to continue the accelerated d deployment into the first half of as of december   we operated  screens outfitted with digital projection systems   of which are digital d 
table of contents capable 
we expect all of our screens to be outfitted with digital projection systems by late or early  with approximately of our total screens being digital d capable by mid second  we renegotiated our agreement with imax during the fiscal period to expand our imax footprint by agreeing to install a total of up to imax digital projection systems by the end of as of december   we operated a total of imax screens 
we believe that expanding our imax footprint  combined with a more favorable allocation of costs included in the new agreement  will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results 
finally  as of december   we had converted seven of our auditoriums to our proprietary large screen format known as rpx sm 
we have been encouraged by the initial results of rpx sm and expect to expand our rpx sm footprint by converting up to additional auditoriums throughout we believe the installation of d digital projection systems and imax theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to rpx sm auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium d movie and large all digital format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the company 
we remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see continued support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate  including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
evidenced by the motion picture studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as rango  thor  pirates of the caribbean on stranger tides  the hangover part ii  kung fu panda  cars  x men first class  super  green lantern  transformers dark of the moon  harry potter and the deathly hallows part  captain america the first avenger  cowboys aliens  happy feet  the twilight saga breaking dawn part one  alvin and the chipmunks chip wrecked and sherlock holmes we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron and a continued increase in d screens and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
in addition  we expect fiscal admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in part ii  item of this form k

the refinancing agreement also amends the second amended and restated guaranty and collateral agreement  dated may   to exclude margin stock from the grant of the security interest in the collateral used to secure the obligations under the amended senior credit facility 
results of operations based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to regal fiscal year of were estimated to have decreased by less than one percent in comparison to the fiscal year of the industry box office results were negatively impacted by difficult comparisons generated by the breadth of films released during the fiscal year of  partially offset by ticket price increases and an increase in the percentage of attendance generated by premium priced d and imax films  including the strong performance of avatar  toy story  alice in wonderland  iron man  and inception

table of contents fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues decreased million  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period 
an decline in attendance  partially offset by a increase in average ticket prices  led to the decrease in the fiscal period admissions revenues 
we believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios 
the fiscal period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to the overall lack of appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the fiscal period as compared to the films exhibited during the fiscal period 
an increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium priced d and imax films exhibited during the fiscal period along with price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions were the primary drivers of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket prices 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the decrease in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly greater than the industry results for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
we believe the greater than industry decrease in admissions revenues on a per screen basis in the fiscal period was attributable to geographical differences in film product performance 
concessions total concessions revenues decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during the fiscal period increased  to  from for the fiscal period 
the increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the fiscal period was primarily a result of selective price increases 
other operating revenues during the fiscal period  other operating revenues increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by national cinemedia net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire  revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues  including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs 
the slight increase in other operating revenues during the fiscal period was primarily driven by increases in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs and other theatre revenues  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our vendor marketing programs 
film rental and advertising costs film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues of during the fiscal period were consistent with that of the fiscal period 
film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily impacted by higher film costs associated with the success of avatar  offset by a reduction in newspaper advertising costs 
cost of concessions for the fiscal period  cost of concessions as a percentage of concession revenues was approximately  compared to for the fiscal period 
the decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily related to selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the fiscal period  slightly lower raw material costs for certain items and a shift in the mix and sizes of products sold at the concession 
table of contents stand 
in addition  we also experienced an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions during the fiscal period 
rent expense rent expense increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in rent expense during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental rent associated with the screens acquired from an affiliate of amc  partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of screens subsequent to the end of the fiscal period 
other operating expenses during the fiscal period  other operating expenses increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in other operating expenses during the fiscal period was attributable to increased costs associated with higher d and imax film revenues and incremental dcip related expenses  partially offset by savings in theatre level payroll and non rent occupancy costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to during the fiscal period  from in the fiscal period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to increases in stock based compensation expense and corporate payroll costs during the period 
depreciation and amortization during the fiscal period  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily due to accelerated depreciation of million related to the replacement of mm film projectors in connection with our conversion to digital projection systems  partially offset by slightly lower capital expenditures during the fiscal period 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the net decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in total revenues and the fixed cost nature of certain operating expense line items including rent expense and other operating expenses  partially offset by a lower loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets million and million  respectively  for the fiscal period and fiscal period 
interest expense  net during the fiscal period  net interest expense declined million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in net interest expense during the fiscal period was principally due to a lower average effective interest rate on our term facility as a result of a change in our interest rate swap portfolio during the fiscal period  a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchases of our convertible senior notes and 
table of contents incremental interest income during the fiscal period  partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the million regal cinemas senior notes due the senior notes in july and the issuance of the senior notes in august earnings recognized from ncm the company received million and million  respectively  in cash distributions from national cinemedia including payments received under the tax receivable agreement described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k during the fiscal period and fiscal period 
approximately million and million  respectively  of these cash distributions received during the fiscal period and the fiscal period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in national cinemedia 
the remaining amounts were recognized in equity earnings during each of these periods and have been included as a component of earnings recognized from ncm in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the increase in earnings recognized from national cinemedia during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to slightly higher earnings of national cinemedia and the timing of their contractual cash distributions to the company 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively  reflect effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal period is primarily attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rates in certain states and the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities during the fiscal period 
the effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non deductible expenses and income tax credits 
net income attributable to controlling interest net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was million  which represents a decrease of million  from net income attributable to controlling interest of million during the fiscal period 
the decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income  the fiscal period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the amended senior credit facility and certain repurchases of the convertible senior notes  incremental losses from the company equity investment in dcip  partially offset by the impact of the million million after related tax effects gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions total admissions revenues increased million during the fiscal period  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period primarily due to a increase in average ticket prices  partially offset by a decrease in attendance 
we believe the overall decrease in attendance during the fiscal period was primarily a result of the timing of the fiscal period calendar  which consisted of fifty three weeks compared to fifty two weeks during the fiscal period 
the overall decrease in fiscal period attendance was mitigated by the full benefit twelve months in the fiscal period as compared to eight months in the fiscal period of the inclusion of screens acquired from consolidated theatres during the fiscal period 
price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions along with an increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium priced imax and d films exhibited 
table of contents during the fiscal period were the primary drivers of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket prices 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was approximately basis points less than the industry results for the fiscal period as compared to fiscal period 
we believe our less than industry increase in admissions revenues on a per screen basis was largely attributable to geographical differences in film product performance and to a lesser extent  the impact of incremental competitor screens 
concessions during the fiscal period  total concessions revenues increased million  or  to million  from million for the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during the fiscal period increased  to  from for the fiscal period 
the increase in total concessions revenues during the fiscal period was attributable to an increase in average concessions revenues per patron  partially offset by a slight decrease in attendance during the period 
the increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the fiscal period were primarily a result of price increases and also benefitted from the concession friendly mix of film product exhibited during such periods 
other operating revenue other operating revenue decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal period  from million for the fiscal period 
included in other operating revenue are the theatre access fees paid by national cinemedia net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire  marketing revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues  including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs 
the decrease in other operating revenue during the fiscal period was primarily driven by decreases in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs and other theatre revenues  partially offset by a slight increase in marketing revenues from our vendor marketing programs 
film rental and advertising costs film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues declined slightly to during the fiscal period from in the fiscal period 
the decrease in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the fiscal period was primarily the result of a reduction in newspaper advertising costs during such period 
cost of concessions during the fiscal period  cost of concessions increased million  or as compared to the fiscal period 
cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the fiscal period was approximately compared to for the fiscal period 
the increase in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily related to a greater percentage of our concession sales being generated from higher cost items and a decrease in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions 
rent expense rent expense increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in rent expense during the fiscal period was primarily due to the full impact of consolidated theatres during the fiscal period and to a lesser extent  incremental rent from new screens added during the fiscal period and modest increases in contingent rent  partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of screens during the fiscal period 

table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in other operating expenses during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was attributable to the full impact of consolidated theatres during the fiscal period  increased costs associated with higher imax and d film revenues  increased gift card transaction fees and general inflationary increases 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal period  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million as compared to million in the fiscal period 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses remained consistent  at  during the fiscal period and the fiscal period 
the slight increase in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to increases in corporate payroll costs and legal and professional fees during such period 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily due to lower capital expenditures during the fiscal period and a slightly greater number of fully depreciated fixed assets during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
income from operations during the fiscal period  income from operations decreased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the overall decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was driven by increases in various operating expense line items  including cost of concessions  rent expense  other operating expenses  general and administrative expenses and net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets million and million  respectively  for the fiscal period and fiscal period 
interest expense  net net interest expense totaled million for the fiscal period  which represents an increase of million  or  from that of the fiscal period 
the increase in net interest expense during the fiscal period was principally due to a higher effective interest rate on our term facility under the amended senior credit facility the term facility as a result of a change in our interest rate swap portfolio during the fiscal period  incremental interest expense related to the fiscal period issuance of the senior notes  the impact of a full year of interest expense on the million convertible senior notes and less interest income million and million  respectively  for the fiscal period and the fiscal period during such period

approximately million and million  respectively  of these cash distributions received during the fiscal period and the fiscal period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in national cinemedia 
in addition  during the fiscal period and the fiscal period  the company recorded an additional million and million  respectively  of equity earnings with respect to newly issued common units received from national cinemedia during such periods 
as a result  during the fiscal period and the fiscal period  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of earnings from national cinemedia 
such amounts are presented as earnings recognized from ncm in the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in earnings recognized from national cinemedia during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental earnings of national cinemedia and a corresponding increase in their contractually committed cash distributions to the company 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively  reflect effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities during the fiscal period 
the effective tax rates for the fiscal period and the fiscal period also reflect the impact of certain non deductible expenses 
net income attributable to controlling interest during the fiscal period  net income attributable to controlling interest totaled million  which represents a decrease of million  from net income attributable to controlling interest of million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income coupled with incremental interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment  partially offset by incremental earnings recognized from national cinemedia described above 
quarterly results the company consolidated financial statements for the fiscal period include the results of operations of the eight theatres acquired from an affiliate of amc during may and june for periods subsequent to the respective date of acquisition 
the acquisition of such theatres is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
the comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by the inclusion from such date of the results of operations of the acquisitions and to a lesser extent  seasonality

liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under the amended senior credit facility described below 
under the terms of the amended senior credit facility and the senior notes issued during fiscal  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its senior notes and convertible senior notes 
in addition  as described further below  the indenture under the senior notes limits the company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock  purchase or redeem capital stock  make loans or advances to its subsidiaries or the company  or purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations 
operating activities our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately to days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within months 
in addition  from time to time  we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities 
as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit 
net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the decrease in net cash flows generated from operating activities for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income  coupled with the timing of certain fiscal period vendor and income tax payments 
the increase in net cash flows generated from operating activities for the fiscal period as compared to 
table of contents the fiscal period was primarily attributable to an increase in working capital  primarily the timing of certain fiscal period vendor payments 
investing activities our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company theatre facilities including digital d and imax screens and replacing equipment 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company internal rate of return targets 
the credit crisis of late and early negatively impacted real estate development and has caused a temporary slowdown in our building program 
as a result  we currently expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be below our historical levels and in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business 
on march   dcip executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection 
dcip financing raised million  consisting of million in senior bank debt  million in additional junior capital and approximately million in equity contributions consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems from us  amc and cinemark 
concurrent with closing  the company entered into the digital cinema agreements with kasima  llc  and made the dcip contributions 
the company recorded such dcip contributions as an increase in its investment in dcip  which included the fair value of the existing digital projection systems  as determined by an independent appraisal 
in connection with the contribution of its existing digital projection systems  the company recorded a loss on the contribution of million based on the excess of the carrying value of the digital projection systems contributed over the million fair value as determined by an independent appraisal of such equipment 
in addition  during may  regal sold an additional digital projection systems to dcip for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with this sale  the company recorded a loss on disposal of approximately million 
such losses have been presented as a component of net gain loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets in the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal period 
after giving effect to the dcip contributions  the company holds a economic interest in dcip as of december   while continuing to maintain a one third voting interest along with each of amc and cinemark 
since the company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of dcip or any of its subsidiaries  it will continue to account for its investment in dcip under the equity method of accounting 
the costs of implementing digital projection in our theatres will be substantially funded by dcip 
we expect dcip to fund the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors  including us 
we will bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres  which we expect to be relatively comparable to what we currently spend on our conventional film projectors 
in accordance with the master lease  the digital projection systems are leased from kasima  llc under a twelve year term with ten one year fair value renewal options 
the master lease also contains a fair value purchase option 
under the master lease  the company pays annual minimum rent of  per digital projection system for the first six and a half years from the 
table of contents effective date of the agreement and is  upon certain conditions  subject to minimum annual rent of  per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term 
the company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the master lease 
certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum 
the company accounts for the master lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
the initial financing is expected to cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for approximately of our circuit screens 
we ultimately expect to outfit all of our screens with digital projection systems  with approximately of our total screens being digital d capable and intend to complete the conversion of our entire circuit in approximately three to four years 
as of december   we operated  screens outfitted with digital projection systems   of which are digital d capable 
during the early stage of deployment  the company is focusing on an accelerated deployment of d compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run us theatres 
we believe the installation of digital d projection systems and imax theatre systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to rpx sm auditoriums will allow us to offer our patrons premium d and large format movie experiences  which we believe will generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the company 
we remain optimistic about the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see continued support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  on april   march  and march  we received from national cinemedia approximately million  million and million  respectively  newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement 
in addition  on may   we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement in connection with our acquisition of consolidated theatres 
on august   we redeemed million of our national cinemedia common units for a like number of shares of ncm  inc common stock  which we sold in an underwritten public offering for per share  reducing our investment in national cinemedia by million  the average carrying amount of the shares sold 
we received approximately million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us  resulting in a gain on sale of million

we received approximately million of net proceeds from this sale  resulting in a gain on sale of million 
these transactions  together with national cinemedia issuance of million common units to amc in the second quarter of as a result of an acquisition  had the effect of decreasing the company ownership share in national cinemedia

net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
contributing to the million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period  as compared to the fiscal period  was the impact of net proceeds totaling approximately million resulting from the sale of ncm  inc common stock  coupled with lower capital expenditures and higher proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period  partially offset by the million acquisition of eight amc theatres and approximately million of cash contributions to dcip during the fiscal period 
the million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the impact of the million acquisition of consolidated theatres during the fiscal period coupled with capital expenditures that were approximately million lower during the fiscal period  partially offset by less proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately million during the fiscal period

ratings the company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency 
however  companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have  in the opinion of certain rating agencies  the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims  while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability 
ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the company current ratings will continue for any given period of time 
a downgrade of the company debt ratings  depending on the extent  could increase the cost to borrow funds

the net decrease in ebitda in the fiscal period from the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income during the fiscal period as described in further detail above under results of operations 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to 
table of contents time as described in more detail elsewhere in this form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows in millions fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes gain on sale of fandango interest changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on extinguishment of debt gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock other items  net net cash provided by operating activities interest rate swaps as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  regal cinemas had three interest rate swap agreements effective as of january   which hedged an aggregate of approximately million of variable rate debt obligations 
during the quarter ended april   regal cinemas entered into four additional hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two to three years each from the respective effective dates of the swaps  which require regal cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from to and receive interest at a variable rate 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately  million of variable rate debt obligations and became effective during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the three interest rate swaps effective as of january  matured 
as a result  the company four interest rate swap agreements effective as of december  and december  hedged an aggregate of approximately  million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 
on september   because of the sudden deterioration in the credit standing of the lehman counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations  the company concluded that the hedging relationship was no longer expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
as a result  on september   the hedging relationship ceased to qualify for hedge accounting 
for the period from september  through september   the company recognized million the change in fair value of the former hedging derivative as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the lehman counterparty filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  an event of default occurred under the provisions of the interest rate swap agreement between the company and the lehman counterparty  which effectively terminated the interest rate swap on october   as indicated above 
accordingly  million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of october  will be reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings ie  when interest payments are made on the 
table of contents variable rate debt obligations as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining life of the two year original hedge as long as the variable rate debt obligations remain outstanding 
during the quarter ended october   the company released the final portion of the deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss by recording interest expense net of related tax effects of approximately million and a corresponding million reduction of other comprehensive loss 
in addition  during the year ended december   the company paid a final termination value of approximately million including accrued interest associated with the interest rate swap 
under the terms of the company effective interest rate swap agreements as of december   regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately  million of variable rate obligations 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings interest expense 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the four interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company interest rate swaps is based on level inputs as described in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  and represents the estimated amount regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates  credit risk and counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to the company interest rate swaps are major financial institutions 
the company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level
