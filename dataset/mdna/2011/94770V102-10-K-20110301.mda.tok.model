introduction our company 
webmd health corp 
is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering on september  our common stock trades under the symbol wbmd on the nasdaq global select market 
from the completion of our initial public offering through the completion of the merger on october   we were more than owned by hlth corporation which we refer to as hlth 
on october   stockholders of hlth and webmd approved the merger and the transaction was completed later that day  with hlth merging into webmd and webmd continuing as the surviving corporation 
webmd automatically succeeded to all of hlth s assets  liabilities and commitments upon completion of the merger other than the shares of webmd class b common stock owned by hlth which were cancelled in the merger 
in the merger  each share of hlth common stock was converted into shares of webmd common stock 
the shares of webmd s class a common stock were unchanged in the merger and continue to trade on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol wbmd  however  they are no longer referred to as class a because the merger eliminated both webmd s class b common stock and the dual class stock structure that had existed at webmd 
the key reasons for the merger included allowing hlth s stockholders to participate directly in the ownership of webmd  while eliminating 
table of contents hlth s controlling interest in webmd and the inefficiencies associated with having two separate public companies  increasing the ability of webmd to raise capital and to obtain financing  and improving the liquidity of webmd common stock by significantly increasing the number of shares held by public stockholders 
webmd was the only operating business of hlth at the time the merger closed 
accordingly  the completion of the merger did not have a significant effect on the operations of webmd since there were no hlth business operations to combine with webmd s business operations and  while hlth had previously been providing certain corporate services to webmd under a services agreement and had certain other agreements with webmd  those agreements ceased when webmd acquired hlth 
the employees and resources of hlth used to provide services to webmd under the services agreement became employees and resources of webmd upon completion of the merger 
basis of presentation  accounting treatment of the merger 
the applicable accounting treatment for the merger resulted in hlth being considered the acquiring entity of the webmd non controlling interest 
accordingly  the pre acquisition consolidated financial statements of hlth became the historical financial statements of webmd following the completion of the merger  adjusted as described in the next paragraph 
accordingly  in this md a  webmd or the use of we  our  or similar words refers not only to webmd itself but also  where the context requires  to hlth 
the specific names of hlth and webmd are used only where there is a need to distinguish between the legal entities 
in addition  all references in this md a to amounts of shares of hlth common stock and to market prices or purchase prices for hlth common stock have been adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the merger which we refer to as the exchange ratio and are expressed as the number of shares of webmd common stock into which the hlth common stock would be converted in the merger and the equivalent price per share of webmd common stock 
similarly  the exercise price of options and warrants to purchase hlth common stock and the number of shares subject to those options and warrants have been adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio 
for all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing income per common share have been adjusted by multiplying the historical weighted average shares outstanding for hlth by the exchange ratio 
additionally  basic and diluted income per common share have been recalculated to reflect the adjusted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year periods presented 
for the year ended december   these adjustments only apply to the portion of the year prior to the completion of the merger on october  the consolidated accounts of hlth included  until the completion of the merger  of the assets and liabilities of webmd  which was more than owned by hlth until the merger 
the ownership interests of the noncontrolling stockholders of webmd are recorded as noncontrolling interest in the december  consolidated balance sheet included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
in the consolidated statements of operations included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report  net income attributable to company stockholders reflects an adjustment for the noncontrolling stockholders share of the net income of webmd until completion of the merger 
our business 
we are a leading provider of health information services to consumers  physicians and other healthcare professionals  employers and health plans through our public and private online portals  mobile platforms and health focused publications 
our public portals for consumers enable them to obtain health and wellness information including information on specific diseases or conditions  check symptoms  locate physicians  store individual healthcare information  receive periodic e newsletters on topics of individual interest and participate in online communities with peers and experts 
our public portals for physicians and healthcare professionals make it easier for them to access clinical reference sources  stay abreast of the latest clinical information  learn about new treatment options  earn continuing medical education which we refer to as cme credit and communicate with peers 
we also provide mobile health information applications for use by consumers and physicians 
we generate revenue from our public portals primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products  including cme services 
our public portals customers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and consumer products companies 
we also provide e detailing promotion and 
table of contents physician recruitment services 
we also generate revenues through the sale of advertising in webmd the magazine  a consumer magazine distributed to physician office waiting rooms 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of certain information products 
our private portals enable employers and health plans to provide their employees and members with access to personalized health and benefit information and decision support technology that helps them to make more informed benefit  treatment and provider decisions 
in addition  we offer clients of our private portals telephonic health coaching services on a per participant basis across an employee or plan population 
we generate revenue from our private portals through the licensing of these portals and related services to employers and health plans either directly or through distributors 
background information on certain trends influencing the use of our services 
several key trends in the healthcare and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends are described briefly below use of the internet by consumers and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare related issues  motivated in part by the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers 
the internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information  enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of the advertisers and sponsors of our public portals  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for our services 
in addition  in an effort to improve operating efficiencies  some pharmaceutical companies have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years 
we believe that  in their effort to achieve greater overall marketing efficiency  pharmaceutical companies will continue to increase the use of online promotional marketing to physicians and other healthcare professionals  including through use of our services 
however  notwithstanding our general expectation for increased demand  our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including general economic and regulatory conditions and the following the majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months 
we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals 
other factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors  or receipt of revenue under such contracts  include the timing of fda approval for new products or for 
table of contents new approved uses for existing products  the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products  the timing of withdrawals of products from the market  the timing of roll outs of new or enhanced services on our public portals  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 
reaching health conscious consumers 
more than half of the traffic to our consumer portals is in areas of health and wellness that are not related solely to diseases and conditions 
the demand for reaching health conscious consumers is growing significantly 
in addition to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  our public portals advertisers and sponsors include consumer products companies whose products relate to health  wellness  diet  fitness  lifestyle  safety and illness prevention 
during  we supported a growing number of consumer product company clients  including johnson johnson  proctor gamble and nestle corp  along with retailers such as wal mart and target 
we plan to continue to focus on increasing sponsorship revenues from consumer products companies  retailers and other companies that are interested in communicating health related or safety related information about their products or services to our audience 
use of health and benefits applications 
in a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been shifting to consumers  use of information technology to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that through our webmd health and benefits manager tools  including our personal health record application  we are well positioned to play a role in this environment 
however  our strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our private portals clients from those services 
increasing usage of our private portal services requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of healthcare decision support tools and online health management applications and health information services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
we also expect that  for clients and potential clients that have been adversely affected by general economic conditions  we may continue to experience some reductions in initial contracts  contract expansions and contract renewals for our private portal services  as well as reductions in the size of existing contracts 
developments in social media and other applications 
in the past several years  video and multimedia applications have become an increasingly important part of what users expect from internet sites 
in addition  consumers are increasingly using the internet to access social media as a means to communicate and exchange information  including regarding health and wellness 
similarly  physicians and other healthcare professionals are increasingly participating in condition or topic specific community groups and other interactive applications 
consumers and healthcare professionals are also increasingly using mobile devices to access the internet  with physicians increasingly using mobile devices in diagnosis and treatment at the point of care 
mobile  while not yet a meaningful revenue source for us  is expected to be an important area of growth for the future 
we are focused on delivering a multi screen platform that extends the user experience beyond the desktop portal onto the mobile device 
we have invested and intend to continue to invest in software and systems that allow us to meet the demands of our users and sponsors  including customized content management and publishing technology to deliver interactive content  multimedia programming and personalized health applications that engage our users 
the following are some of our recent and current initiatives to improve the user experience on our websites  expand our services and increase our user base physician connect  our social networking platform for physicians  allows them to exchange information online on a range of topics  including patient care  drug information  healthcare related legislation and practice management 
physicians can also create polls to assess the opinions of their colleagues on a range of topics 
we also offer third parties the opportunity to sponsor physician connect discussions and polls so that they can gain insights into physicians perspectives and areas of interest 
as of 
table of contents january   physician connect had attracted more than  physician members 
medscape from webmd also offers a variety of sponsored and unsponsored blogs where healthcare professionals can share their thoughts and opinions with the medscape from webmd community 
in march  we launched the webmd community  a social networking initiative that gives consumers the ability to connect with health experts and with other webmd members to exchange information  experiences and support 
the webmd community is being integrated throughout each of the core content areas of webmd 
com  giving members the ability to safely and easily connect with others on topics that are most relevant to them 
in addition to expert led communities  members are empowered to create their own communities and to exchange information with other users 
the webmd community also enables third party sponsors to create branded experiences and to host consumer discussions on specific health and wellness topics most important to them 
medscape mobile is a free medical application that includes medscape s specialty specific news  comprehensive drug information and clinical reference tools 
medscape mobile also includes cme activities organized by specialty and designed for use on a mobile device 
medscape mobile was launched for iphone and ipod touch users in  for blackberry users in april and for ipad tm and android tm users in january as of december   medscape mobile had attracted approximately  registered users 
webmd for iphone and webmd for ipad are free applications for consumers that provide mobile access to certain webmd content and tools on an iphone or ipad tm  including symptom checker  first aid  and pill identifier applications  as well as other health information 
as of december   these applications had been downloaded a total of approximately million times 
we also provide the entire mobile audience with access to our consumer content and tools through our new mobile site at wwwmwebmd 
com 
we are pursuing opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the united states 
generally  we expect that we would accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region 
in october  we launched our first major consumer portal outside the united states in partnership with boots  the uk s leading pharmacy led health and beauty retailer 
in addition  in certain markets outside of the us  we expect to provide some of our online services directly to healthcare professionals and  to a lesser extent  consumers 
healthcare reform legislation 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of which we refer to as the reform legislation  was signed into law in march the reform legislation makes extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the us in general  the reform legislation seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal us residents by  among other things  requiring individuals to carry  and certain employers to offer  health insurance or be subject to penalties 
the reform legislation also imposes new regulations on health insurers  including guaranteed coverage requirements  prohibitions on certain annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to plan members  increased restrictions on rescinding coverage  establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements  a requirement to cover certain preventive services on a first dollar basis  the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages  and greater limitations on how health insurers price certain of their products 
the reform legislation also contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies  including new taxes on certain sales of their products 
many of the provisions of the reform legislation that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until  and many provisions require regulations and interpretive guidance to be issued before they will be fully implemented 
some provisions do not apply to health plans that were in place when the reform legislation was enacted and have not been substantially changed since 
in addition  it is difficult to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the reform legislation 
furthermore  the reform legislation will result in future state legislative and regulatory changes  which we are unable to predict at this time  in order for states to comply with certain provisions of the reform legislation and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities 
in addition  a number of states 
table of contents have filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the reform legislation 
as of february   two federal courts have ruled that the requirement for individuals to carry insurance is unconstitutional  but other courts have upheld this provision 
while we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on webmd as a direct result of the application of the reform legislation to our businesses or on our company in its capacity as an employer  we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts of the reform legislation will be on webmd s businesses through its effects on other healthcare industry participants  including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of our public portals and employers and health plans that are clients of our private portals 
healthcare industry participants may respond to the reform legislation or to uncertainties created by the reform legislation by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions  including expenditures for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we believe that certain aspects of the reform legislation and future implementing regulations that seek to reduce healthcare costs may create opportunities for webmd  including with respect to our personal health record applications and health and benefits decision support tools and  more generally  with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education 
for example  the reform legislation encourages use of wellness programs through grants to small employers to establish such programs  permission for employers to offer rewards  in the form of waivers of cost sharing  premium discounts  or additional benefits  to employees for participating in these programs and meeting certain standards  and the inclusion of wellness services and chronic disease management among the essential health benefits that certain plans are required to provide 
however  we cannot yet determine the scope of any such opportunities or what competition we may face in our efforts to pursue such opportunities 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors

directors officers liability insurance coverage litigation 
on july   hlth commenced litigation which we refer to as the coverage litigation in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county against ten insurance companies in which hlth was seeking to compel the defendant companies which we refer to collectively as the defendants to honor their obligations under certain directors and officers liability insurance policies which we refer to as the policies 
webmd succeeded to hlth as plaintiff in this action as a result of the merger 
hlth was seeking an order requiring the defendants to advance and or reimburse expenses that hlth has incurred and expected to continue to incur for the advancement of the reasonable defense costs of initially ten  and now four  former officers and directors of hlth s former emdeon practice services subsidiary which we refer to as eps who were indicted in connection with the investigation by united states attorney for the district of south carolina which we refer to as the investigation described in note  commitments and contingencies located in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
pursuant to a stipulation among the parties  the coverage litigation was transferred on september  to the superior court of the state of delaware in and for new castle county 
the policies were issued to hlth and to eps  which is a co plaintiff with webmd in the coverage litigation which we refer to collectively as the plaintiffs 
eps was sold in september to sage software and has changed its name to sage software healthcare  inc which we refer to as sshi 
in connection with hlth s sale of eps to sage software  hlth retained certain obligations relating to the investigation and agreed to indemnify sage software and sshi with respect to certain expenses in connection with the investigation and we assumed those obligations as a result of the merger 
hlth retained and we succeeded to as a result of the merger the right to assert claims and recover proceeds under the policies on behalf of sshi 
prior to the filing of the second amended complaint which is discussed below  the policies at issue in the coverage litigation consisted of two separate groups of insurance policies 
each group of policies consists of several layers of coverage  with different insurers having agreed to provide specified amounts of coverage at various levels 
the first group of policies was issued to eps in the amount of  which we refer to as the eps policies and the second group of policies was issued to synetic  inc the former parent of eps  which merged into hlth in the amount of  of which approximately  was paid by the primary carrier with respect to another unrelated matter which we refer to as the synetic policies 
the carrier with the third level of coverage in the synetic policies filed a motion for summary judgment in the coverage litigation  which most of the carriers who have issued the synetic policies joined  which sought summary judgment that any liability to pay defense costs should be allocated among the three sets of policies available to us including the policies with respect to which the coverage litigation relates and a third set of policies the issuers of which had not yet been named by us such that the synetic policies would only be liable to 
table of contents pay about  of the  total coverage available under such policies 
hlth filed its opposition to the motion together with its motion for summary judgment against such carrier and several other carriers who have issued the synetic policies seeking to require such carriers to advance payment of the defense costs that we are obligated to pay while the coverage litigation is pending 
on july   the superior court for the state of delaware denied the motion filed by the carriers seeking allocation and granted hlth s motion for partial summary judgment to enforce the duty of such carriers to advance and reimburse these costs 
pursuant to the court s order  the issuers of the synetic policies began reimbursing us for our costs as described below 
on september  and february   respectively  the eighth and ninth level carriers of the synetic policies notified hlth that they believe that they were not bound by the court s july  order regarding the duty of the synetic carriers to advance and reimburse defense costs 
this resulted in hlth making a motion to the court on february  to require such eighth and ninth level carriers to advance and reimburse defense costs 
hlth later settled with the eighth level carrier 
under the terms of the settlement such carrier has paid  in full and final settlement  an agreed upon percentage of the policy amount against each payment of defense costs made by us as such policy was implicated 
on april   the ninth level carrier made a cross motion for summary judgment claiming that  in light of a policy endorsement applicable only to the ninth level carrier  because of the time period during which the conspiracy charged in the second superseding indictment is alleged to have taken place  the synetic policy issued by such carrier does not cover hlth s indemnification obligations 
hlth believed that such carrier s motion was without merit and responded to the motion 
on july   the court granted summary judgment in favor of the ninth level carrier and unless and until we successfully appeal such decision  the ninth level carrier is not liable to pay any portion of the  total coverage of its policy with respect to our indemnification obligations 
as of december    has been paid by insurance companies representing the eps policies and the synetic policies through a combination of payment under the terms of the policies  payment under reservation of rights or through settlement 
of this amount   represents the portion received through settlement 
on november   hlth filed a second amended complaint which added four new insurance companies as defendants in the coverage action 
these carriers are the issuers of a third set of policies which we refer to as the emdeon policies that provide coverage with respect to hlth s indemnification obligations to the former officers and directors of hlth s former eps subsidiary who were indicted in connection with the investigation 
all but one of the carriers who issued the emdeon policies moved for summary judgment asserting that exclusions in the emdeon policies preclude coverage for hlth s indemnification obligations and hlth filed motions seeking to compel such carriers to advance defense costs that hlth was obligated to indemnify 
on august   the court issued two opinions 
in the first opinion  the court granted summary judgment in favor of hlth with respect to one of the exclusions asserted by the carriers who issued the emdeon policies 
in the second opinion  the court granted summary judgment in favor of the carriers with respect to the other exclusion asserted by such carriers 
we and the carriers who issued the emdeon policies with the exception of the second level carrier with whom we have settled each appealed the trial court s august  rulings to the supreme court of delaware and  on april   the supreme court decided both appeals in favor of the carriers who issued the emdeon policies 
the implication of this decision is that we have effectively exhausted our insurance with respect to our obligation to indemnify the indicted individuals 
the insurance carriers assert that our insurance policies provide that under certain circumstances  amounts advanced by the insurance companies in connection with the defense costs of the indicted individuals may have to be repaid by us  although the amounts that we have received in settlement from certain carriers is not subject to being repaid 
we have obtained an undertaking from each indicted individual pursuant to which  under certain circumstances  such individual has agreed to repay defense costs advanced on such individual s behalf 
in addition to the coverage litigation  on december   tig specialty insurance company which we refer to as tig  the second level issuer of the eps policies  commenced an action against us to recover the  that tig advanced to us in our company and tig have settled this matter 

table of contents we intend to continue to satisfy our legal obligation to the indicted individuals with respect to advancement of amounts for their defense costs 
indemnification obligations to former officers and directors of eps 
hlth had certain indemnity obligations to advance amounts for reasonable defense costs for initially ten  and now four  former officers and directors of eps  who were indicted in connection with the investigation 
in connection with the sale of eps  hlth agreed to indemnify sage software relating to these indemnity obligations and we also assumed that obligation in the merger 
during  based on information available at that time  we determined a reasonable estimate of the range of probable costs with respect to our indemnification obligation and accordingly  recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of  which represented our estimate of the low end of the probable range of costs related to this matter 
we reserved the low end of the probable range of costs because no estimate within the range was a better estimate than any other amount 
that estimate included assumptions as to the duration of the trial and pre trial periods  and the defense costs to be incurred during these periods 
during and  we updated the estimated range of our indemnification obligation based on new information received during those periods  and as a result  recorded additional pre tax charges of  and  respectively 
as described in more detail above  two of the former officers and directors of eps were found guilty  however  the court set the verdict aside on may  and entered a judgment of acquittal 
the government entered a notice of appeal with respect to the court s order and such appeal is pending 
two other former officers of eps are awaiting trial in tampa  florida  which was scheduled to begin on october   however  on july   the court in tampa placed the case against those defendants on hold pending resolution of the appeal of the south carolina ruling 
as of december   the remaining accrual with respect to the costs for these matters was  and is included within liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the ultimate outcome of this matter is still uncertain and  accordingly  the amount of cost we may ultimately incur could be substantially more than the reserve we have currently provided 
if the recorded reserves are insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of this matter  we will need to record additional charges to our results of operations in future periods 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal  primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  much of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and website development costs  the carrying value of investments  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses  contingencies  litigation and related legal accruals and the value attributed to employee stock options and other stock based awards 
critical accounting policies we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  information services and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services  are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
in certain instances where fair value does not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized as the last element is delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on fair value using exit price and market participant view  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets noted as a result of our impairment testing in fair value of investments in auction rate securities ars 
through april   we held investments in ars which were backed by student loans  guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of these ars holdings approximated par value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  substantially all auctions involving these securities have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars holdings will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets develop 
additionally  approximately one half of the auction rate securities we held were  during  either downgraded below aaa or placed on watch status by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
during the periods that we held them  we estimated the fair value of our ars holdings using an income approach valuation technique 
using this approach  expected future cash flows are calculated 
table of contents over the expected life of each security and are discounted to a single present value using a market required rate of return 
some of the more significant assumptions made in the present value calculations included i the estimated weighted average lives for the loan portfolios underlying each individual ars and ii the required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows over the estimated life of each security  which considered both the credit quality for each individual ars and the market liquidity for these investments 
additionally  effective april   we adopted new authoritative guidance which required us to separate losses associated with our ars into two categories  the portion of the loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of the loss which is due to other factors 
as discussed above  certain of the auction rate securities we held were  during  downgraded below aaa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
these revised credit ratings were a significant consideration in determining the estimated credit loss associated with our ars 
our ars were classified as level assets as their valuation  including the portion of their valuation attributable to credit losses  required substantial judgment and estimation of factors that were not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars holdings  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of those investments could have been significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
in connection with the sale of our ars on april   we retained an option which we refer to as the ars option  for a period of two years a to repurchase from the purchaser the same principal amount of any or all of the various series of ars sold  at the agreed upon purchase prices received on april   and b to receive additional proceeds from the purchaser upon certain redemptions of the various series of ars sold 
during  the company recognized an aggregate gain of  related to the ars option  and received cash proceeds of  during the period from april  through december  the value of the ars option as of december  is estimated to be  and has been classified as a level asset as its valuation requires substantial judgment 
the historical redemption activity of the specific ars underlying the ars option was the most significant assumption used to determine an estimated value of the ars option 
the company is required to reassess the value of this ars option at each reporting period  and any changes in value will be recorded within the statement of operations in future periods 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding our ars option 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of the share based payment awards 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards held by employees  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years  related to our stock based compensation plans 
deferred taxes 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits 
these net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets  including the portion related to excess tax benefits of stock based awards  are reserved for by a valuation allowance as required by relevant accounting literature 
the remaining portion of our net deferred tax assets are no longer reserved for by a valuation allowance 
management determines the need for a valuation allowance by assessing the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical 
table of contents operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
tax contingencies 
our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from applications of various statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable 
however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
consistent with our historical financial reporting  we have elected to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision benefit

table of contents enable us to service future growth in unique users and page views  as well as to create new sponsorship areas for our customers  and to improve the systems used to provide our private portal applications 
based on our plans and expectations we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the cash commitments of our notes and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  for at least the next twenty four months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  implementation of new or updated application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments and potential future acquisitions

off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements adopted during we adopted the new authoritative guidance which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests  previously called minority interests 
this new guidance required that a noncontrolling interest be reported in the consolidated balance sheets within equity and separate from the parent company s equity 
also  the new guidance required consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest  all on the face of the consolidated operating statement 
in addition  discontinued operations and continuing operations reflected as part of the noncontrolling interest should be allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations for the calculation of earnings per share 
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report reflect the retrospective application of this accounting standard which we adopted effective january  we adopted the new authoritative guidance which requires cash settled convertible debt to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each 
this new guidance affected the accounting for our notes 
the value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
the difference between the bond s cash proceeds and this estimated fair value  which was  at the time the notes were issued during august  represents a debt discount and will be amortized to interest expense over the period from issuance to august the first date on which we may be required to repurchase the notes at the option of the holder 
the  also represents the value of the equity component on the notes and was included within additional paid in capital through december  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report reflect the retrospective application of this accounting standard which we adopted effective january  effective january   we adopted the revised authoritative guidance on business combinations which changed existing practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements are now fair valued at 
table of contents the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs are now expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  reversal of valuation allowances created in purchase accounting are now recorded through the income tax provision  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  all authoritative guidance would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements  it could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated in the future and for tax matters relating to prior acquisitions settled subsequent to december  effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance which clarifies that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities 
we reflected the impact on the year ended december  in the net income loss per common share section of note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the year ended december  and accordingly  that period was not retrospectively adjusted 
in april  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods 
such disclosures were previously required only in annual financial statements 
because this pronouncement applies only to financial statement disclosure  it did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which changed when and how to assess other than temporary impairments of securities and to improve the financial statement presentation of such impairments 
a more detailed description of this new guidance and the impact of its adoption is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
this new guidance was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which established the fasb accounting standards codification which we refer to as codification 
on the effective date of this new guidance  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
this new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  because this pronouncement applies only to financial statement disclosure  it did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables 
in addition  the new guidance requires all revenue under multiple element arrangements to be allocated using their relative selling prices 
the new guidance will be applied prospectively to contracts signed or materially modified beginning january  we cannot  at the present time  quantify the impact of this new guidance on our future results of operations since it will be applied to contracts entered into or materially modified in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our cash and money market investments  which approximate million at december   are not subject to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the notes issued in january have a fixed interest rate  changes in interest rates will not impact our results of operations or financial position 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex  which was sold on october  and included in discontinued operations  was exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
foreign currency translation gains losses relating to our porex operations were million and million in and  respectively
