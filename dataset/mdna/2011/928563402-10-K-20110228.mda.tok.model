item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all dollar amounts expressed as numbers in this md a except per share amounts are in millions 
overview our primary source of revenues is the licensing of virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions and related support and services for use by businesses and organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries in their information technology it infrastructure 
our virtualization solutions reflect a pioneering approach to computing that separates application software from the underlying hardware to achieve significant improvements in efficiency  agility  availability  flexibility and manageability 
our broad and proven suite of virtualization solutions addresses a range of complex it problems that include cost and operational inefficiencies  facilitating access to cloud computing capacity  business continuity  software lifecycle management and corporate end user computing device management 
our solutions run on industry standard servers and desktop computers and support a wide range of operating system and application environments  as well as networking and storage infrastructures 
our solutions enable organizations to aggregate multiple servers  storage infrastructure and networks together into shared pools of capacity that can be allocated dynamically  securely and reliably to applications as needed  increasing hardware utilization and reducing spending 
the benefits to our customers include substantially lower it costs  cost effective high availability across a wide range of applications  and a more automated and resilient systems infrastructure capable of responding dynamically to variable business demands 
with our latest platform  vmware vsphere  we are helping companies along the path of cloud computing by providing compatible it infrastructures for both businesses and cloud service providers 
although we believe we are currently the leading provider of virtualization infrastructure software solutions  we face competitive threats to our leadership position from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater resources than we do  which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on our offerings 
as a result  we believe it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development  market expansion and associated support functions to expand our industry leadership 
we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our product development objectives through continued investment in our existing infrastructure  supplemented with strategic hires and acquisitions  funded through the operating cash flows generated from the sale of our products and services 
we believe this is the appropriate priority for the long term health and growth of our business 
our current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate free cash flows to fund our expansion of industry segment share and to evolve our virtualization based products for data centers  desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions 
we expect to grow our business by broadening our virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio  increasing product awareness  promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements elas 
since the introduction in of vmware vsphere and vmware view  we have introduced more products that build on the vsphere foundation 
in the third quarter of  we released updated versions of vmware vsphere and vmware view  and we plan to continue to introduce additional products in the future 
additionally  we have made  and expect to continue to make  acquisitions designed to strengthen our product offerings and or extend our strategy to deliver solutions that can be hosted at customer data centers or at service providers 
free cash flows  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs 
each adjusting item is separately presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see non gaap financial measures for further information 

table of contents in evaluating our results  we also focus on operating margin excluding certain expenses included in our total operating expenses calculated in accordance with gaap 
the expenses excluded are stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses consisting of employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items 
we believe this measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
we are not currently focused on short term operating margin expansion  but rather on investing at appropriate rates to support our growth and future product offerings in what may be a substantially more competitive environment 
we have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand our presence and to reach various segments of the industry 
in we derived over of our sales from our channel partners  which include distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
sales to our channel partners often involve three tiers of distribution a distributor  a reseller and an end user customer 
our sales force works collaboratively with our channel partners to introduce them to customers and new sales opportunities 
as we expand geographically  we expect to continue to add additional channel partners 
the remainder of our sales is primarily derived from purchases made directly by end user customers 
from late and through most of  macroeconomic conditions deteriorated globally and we observed that customers responded to the economic downturn with reductions in it spending 
since the fourth quarter of and through  we have benefited  along with the it industry  from pent up demand for it products and services 
while the overall macroeconomic environment has improved since late  and while we believe that our customers continue to adopt our product platform as a strategic investment that enables substantial cost savings and improves efficiency and flexibility for their business  we continue to be cautious about the macroeconomic environment and the volatility we are observing in the world economy 
we expect to continue to manage our resources prudently  while making key investments in support of our long term growth objectives 
the majority of our contracts include both perpetual software licenses and ongoing software maintenance contracts 
license revenues are recognized when the elements of revenue recognition for the licensed software are complete  generally upon electronic shipment of the software 
software maintenance revenues are typically recognized ratably over the term of the software maintenance period  ie over periods from one to five years subsequent to the initial contract  and include renewals of software maintenance sold after the initial software maintenance period expires 
we also recognize revenues from professional services provided to our customers primarily as services are performed 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts or the stated renewal rate for software maintenance included in the license agreement 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
as a consequence of the timing differences in the recognition of license revenues and software maintenance revenues  variability in operating margin can result from differences in when we quote and contract for our services and when the cost is incurred 
variability in operating margin can also result when we recognize our foreign denominated unearned maintenance revenues in future periods 
due to our use of the us dollar as our functional currency  unearned revenue remains at its historical rate when recognized into revenue while our operating expenses in future periods are based upon the foreign exchange rates at that time 
our unearned revenue  both current and long term  represents a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the requirements of revenue recognition have not yet been met  and it consists of amounts received from customers and amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
our unearned revenues consist of unearned software maintenance revenues  unearned professional services revenues and unearned license revenues 
as of december   total unearned revenues were  an increase of from the previous year 
of the total   will be recognized ratably over terms from one to five years  and is comprised of  of software maintenance revenue and of license revenue 
the 
table of contents weighted average remaining term of arrangements where revenue will be recognized ratably is approximately years 
additionally  unearned revenues of are related to software license revenue  which will be recognized upon the shipment of either existing or future products and is classified as current unearned revenue 
future products include  in some cases  emerging products that are offered as part of product promotions where the purchaser of an existing product is entitled to receive a promotional product at no additional charge 
we regularly offer product promotions  generally as a strategy to build awareness of our emerging products 
to the extent promotional products are not yet available  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product obligations have been fulfilled 
the remaining unearned revenues of relate to professional services and will be recognized when the services are delivered 
we believe our overall unearned revenue balance improves predictability of future revenues and that it is a key indicator of the health and growth of our business 
until the second quarter of  most of our revenue contracts with international channel partners were denominated in us dollars  but a portion of our operating expenses were  and continue to be  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
this currency difference between our revenues and operating expenses historically caused variability in our operating margins due to fluctuations in the us dollar as compared with other currencies 
in the second quarter of  we started to invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
as a result of invoicing in these local currencies in which we also have expenses  variability in operating margin due to foreign currency fluctuations has been reduced 
however  increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations introduces additional risk for variability in revenue related components of our consolidated financial statements when these locally denominated revenues are remeasured into us dollars 
we calculate the foreign currency impact on our revenues as the difference between revenues translated at current exchange rates and the same revenues translated at prior period exchange rates 
given that we began to invoice and collect in currencies other than the us dollar during the second quarter of  we are not able to determine the full year over year impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues 
the uncertainty and volatility of currency fluctuations will continue to impact our results 
in order to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  since july  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities against movements in certain foreign exchange rates 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under applicable accounting guidance  and therefore all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the gains and losses on our foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the majority of the gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge 
our relationship with emc as of december   emc owned  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock  representing approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
in april  we acquired certain software product technology and expertise from emc s ionix it management business for cash consideration of emc retained the ionix brand and will continue to offer customers the products acquired by us  pursuant to the ongoing reseller agreement we have with emc 
the net assets and expertise acquired from emc constituted a business and were accounted for as a business combination between entities under common control pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for further information 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid of contingent amounts to emc in accordance with the asset purchase agreement 
pursuant to the ongoing reseller arrangement with emc that commenced in  emc bundles our products and services with emc s hardware and sells them to end users 
in and  we recognized 
table of contents revenues of and  respectively  from products and services sold pursuant to our reseller arrangement with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from products and services sold under the reseller arrangement were included in unearned revenue 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized professional services revenues of  and  respectively  for services provided to emc s customers pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from professional services to emc customers were included in unearned revenue 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues of  and  respectively  from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use were included in unearned revenue 
we purchased storage systems and software  as well as consulting services  from emc for  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity  we contract with emc subsidiaries for support services and emc employees who are managed by our personnel 
the costs incurred by emc on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had we contracted for such services with an unrelated third party 
these costs are included as expenses in our consolidated statements of income and primarily include salaries and benefits  travel and rent 
additionally  emc historically incurred certain costs on our behalf in the us  which primarily related to a shared system for travel 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented our own travel system in the us and are now incurring these costs directly 
the total cost of the services provided to us by emc as described above was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as calculated under our tax sharing agreement with emc  we paid emc in for our portion of emc s consolidated federal income taxes 
under the same tax sharing agreement  emc paid us in for a refund of an overpayment related to the consolidated federal and state income taxes for the fiscal year ended december  in and  we paid and  respectively  for our portion of emc s consolidated federal and state income taxes for various periods  as well as the conclusion of the and federal income tax audit 
in  emc paid us for our stand alone federal taxable loss for the fiscal year ending december  and for a refund of an overpayment related to our portion of emc s federal consolidated income taxes 
no payments were made by emc in the amounts that we pay to emc for our portion of federal income taxes on emc s consolidated tax return differ from the amounts we would owe on a stand alone basis and the difference is presented as a component of stockholders equity 
in and  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as an increase in stockholders equity of and  respectively 
in  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as a decrease in stockholders equity of interest expense with emc  net  primarily consists of interest expense on the note payable to emc

our interest income and expenses as a separate  stand alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in  we resolved with emc certain acquisition related intercompany liabilities due to emc 
as a result  intercompany liabilities due to emc of were recorded as a capital contribution from emc in additional paid in capital without the issuance of additional equity by us or remittance of any cash 

table of contents as of december   we had due from emc  which was partially offset by due to emc 
as of december   we had due from emc  which was partially offset by due to emc 
the net amounts due from emc as of december  and december  were and  respectively  and resulted from the related party transactions described above 
in addition to the due from emc as of december   we had of income taxes receivable due from emc  which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had of income taxes receivable due from emc and of income taxes payable due to emc 
a large portion of the income tax receivable is related to federal income taxes and is expected to be received from emc after the consolidated federal tax return extension is filed 
balances due to or from emc which are unrelated to tax obligations are generally settled in cash within days of each quarter end 
the timing of the tax payments due to and from emc is governed by the tax sharing agreement with emc 
by nature of emc s majority ownership of us  the amounts we recorded for our intercompany transactions with emc would not be considered arm s length with an unrelated third party 
therefore the financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows had we engaged in such transactions with an unrelated third party during all periods presented 
accordingly  our historical results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance as a stand alone company 
income statement presentation as we operate our business in one operating segment  our revenues and operating expenses are presented and discussed at the consolidated level 
sources of revenues license revenues our license revenues consist of revenues earned from the licensing of our software products 
these products are generally priced and licensed on a perpetual basis based upon the number of physical desktop computers or server processors on which our software runs 
certain products are licensed on a subscription basis 
effective september   our management solutions are priced on a per virtual machine basis 
the new model for management products better aligns with our customer s need to manage the number of virtual machines  rather than to the management of physical hardware 
software maintenance revenues software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
our contract periods typically range from one to five years 
customers receive various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
customers who are party to software maintenance agreements with us are entitled to receive product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services revenues professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products  as these services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by our customers or by other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion  are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours incurred and estimated hours of completion 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based on hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 

table of contents operating expenses cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues principally consists of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and of intangibles  as well as royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third party providers and the cost of fulfillment of our software 
the cost of fulfillment of our software includes product packaging  personnel costs and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products 
cost of services revenues our cost of services revenues includes the costs of personnel and related overhead to deliver technical support for our products and to provide our professional services 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses include the personnel and related overhead associated with the research and development of new product offerings and the enhancement of our existing software offerings  net of amounts capitalized 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions and related overhead associated with the sale and marketing of our license and services offerings  as well as the cost of product launches and certain marketing initiatives  including our annual vmworld conferences in the us and europe 
sales commissions are generally earned and expensed when a firm order is received from the customer and may be recognized in a period different than the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the overall business 
these expenses include the costs associated with our facilities  finance  human resources  it infrastructure and legal departments

table of contents total revenues were  in   in and  in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in the revenue mix in reflected an increase in license revenues and an increase in services revenues as compared with the revenue mix in reflected a decrease in license revenues and an increase in services revenues as compared with in and  the growth in our services revenues was driven by strong maintenance renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software licenses 
our professional services practice has continued to grow in conjunction with the growth of our customer base 
during  we saw improved economic conditions and a corresponding increase in customer spending  which drove our license revenue growth for the year 
geographically  both us and international revenues increased in and  respectively  as compared with their respective prior years 
the decline in license revenues year over year in was a result of customers delaying or reducing their it purchases in response to the macroeconomic environment 
license revenues software license revenues were  in   in and  in  representing a year over year increase of or in and a year over year decrease of or in we believe license revenues benefited in from the improving macroeconomic environment  resulting in strong customer demand for the vsphere platform and growing interest in our desktop and management solutions 
we believe that the revenue decline in compared with was due to the difficult macroeconomic environment and the related challenges that our customers faced  including reduced budgets for it spending 
we have promoted the adoption of virtualization and built long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of elas 
elas continue to be an important component of our revenue growth and are offered both directly by us and through certain channel partners 
elas are core to our strategy to build long term relationships with customers as they commit to our virtualization infrastructure software solutions in their data centers 
elas provide a base from which to sell additional products  such as our application platform products  our end user computing products  and virtualization and cloud management products 
under a typical ela  a portion of the revenues is attributed to the license and recognized immediately and the remainder is deferred and recognized as services maintenance revenues in future periods 
in addition  elas typically include an initial maintenance period that is longer than other types of license sales 
in  we observed an increase in the volume of our elas as compared with and  due in part to growing international customer interest as well as the improving economic environment 
in addition  in  customers generally renewed their elas at a dollar value higher than the original transaction and with an average maintenance term of three years 
the increase in the value of the renewed elas compared with the initial elas is typically due to additional products and upgrades added to the renewed elas  as well as the expanding use of originally purchased products within the customer s environment 
services revenues services revenues were  in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in the increase in services revenues during and was primarily attributable to growth in our software maintenance revenues 
software maintenance revenues were  in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in in and  software maintenance revenues benefited from strong renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software licenses 
in  customers continued to buy  on average  more than months of support and maintenance with each new license purchased  which we believe illustrates our customers commitment to vmware as a core element of their data center architecture 
in addition  in  services revenues increased year over year as a result of customers becoming current on their maintenance agreements in order to receive our release of vsphere as a part of their service arrangements 

table of contents professional services revenues were in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in professional services revenues increased as growth in our installed base led to strong demand for our professional services  including consulting and customer training 
as we continue to invest in our partners and expand our eco system of third party professionals with expertise in our solutions to independently provide professional services to our customers  we do not expect our professional services revenues to constitute an increasing component of our revenue mix 
as a result of this strategy  our professional services revenue can vary based on the delivery channels used in any given period as well as the timing of engagements

the other expenses excluded are employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items 
see non gaap financial measures below for further information 
operating margins increased from in to in and decreased from in to in the increase in our operating margin in compared with primarily related to the increase in our revenues  which outpaced the increase in our expenses 
the decrease in our operating margin in compared with primarily related to slower revenue growth  which was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn in and late and our continued investments in our products and the company s infrastructure 
in evaluating our results  we generally focus on core operating expenses 
we believe that our core operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  in the table above 
core operating expenses the following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that our management focuses upon in evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses 
the increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses  which consist of employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items set forth above 
core operating expenses increased by or in compared with and or in compared with as quantified below  these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  bonuses  commissions  and recruiting and training 
the increases in employee related expenses for both periods were largely a result of incremental headcount from strategic hiring  business growth and business acquisitions  as well as from higher commission expense as a result of increased sales volumes beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through in  the increase in core operating expenses was partially offset by the benefit from the austerity measures that we introduced at the end of in response to the global economic downturn 
these austerity measures included reduced travel and entertainment costs  decreased contractor costs  hiring limits and suspensions of merit pay increases and matching contributions to employee k retirement plan accounts 
we reinstated matching contributions to k retirement plan accounts in the fourth quarter of  and we reinstated a budget for merit pay increases effective in the second quarter of a portion of our core operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  marketing  and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  and are thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
core operating expenses were negatively impacted by in and benefited by in  as compared with their respective prior years  due to the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
cost of license revenues core operating expenses in cost of license revenues increased by or in compared with and by or in as compared with the increases were primarily due to increases of and  respectively  in royalty and licensing costs for technology licensed from third party providers that is used in our products

sales and marketing expenses core operating expenses for sales and marketing increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of driven by incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions as well as by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes 
in support of our expanding markets and sales efforts  the costs of marketing programs increased by  and travel and entertainment expense increased by we also incurred additional expenses of for it infrastructure development to support revenue growth  as well as consulting projects 
the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies had a minimal impact on expenses in the increase in was primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of driven by incremental headcount added in conjunction with our international expansion as well as by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes 
these increases in were partially offset by the positive impact of from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies  a decrease in travel and entertainment expense of resulting from the austerity measures we implemented at the end of  and a decrease in the costs of marketing programs of general and administrative expenses core operating expenses for general and administrative increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to corporate expenses  including contributions to our charitable foundation and legal fees 
also contributing to the increase in expenses in was depreciation and equipment expenses of and employee related expenses of due to the incremental growth in headcount 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to employee related expenses as a result of additional personnel employed to enhance the infrastructure of our business and to expand our own administrative functions 
the increase in employee related expenses in also included expenses related to the relocation of certain functions to lower cost geographical regions 

table of contents stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  stock based compensation  excluding amounts capitalized stock based compensation capitalized stock based compensation  including amounts capitalized stock based compensation expense was in  in and in  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in over was primarily due to an increase of for grants made to new employees  an increase of from new awards made to our existing employees  and an increase of from equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition of springsource late in the third quarter of these increases were offset in part by a decrease of primarily related to forfeitures and grants reaching a fully vested status 
in  stock based compensation increased over primarily due to an increase of from restricted stock unit awards to certain international employees who were not eligible to participate in the september offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under vmware s equity and incentive plan and restricted stock unit awards to various other employees for retention purposes 
additionally  stock based compensation increased by for new awards made to our existing employees in the second quarter of and from equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition of springsource late in the third quarter of the increases were offset by a decrease of primarily related to forfeitures and grants reaching a fully vested status 
stock based compensation is recorded to each operating expense category based upon the function of the employee to whom the stock based compensation relates and fluctuates based upon the value and number of awards granted 
compensation philosophy varies by function  resulting in different weightings of cash incentives versus equity incentives 
as a result  functions with larger cash based components  such as commissions  will have comparatively lower stock based compensation expense than other functions 
as of december   the total unamortized fair value of our outstanding equity based awards held by our employees was approximately this amount will be recognized over the awards requisite service periods  and is expected to result in stock based compensation expense of approximately   and for   and  respectively 
in future quarters  we expect our total stock based compensation expense to increase as a result of additional equity grants we have recently made as well as grants we expect to make 
stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated statements of income is reduced by the amount of stock based compensation that may be capitalized for the development of new software products and the amount of awards that are forfeited 
capitalized software development costs  net capitalization of material development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the products technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
the r d expenses and amounts that we capitalize as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in a variety of factors  including multiple areas of judgment inherent in the assessment of these costs 
in  and  we capitalized including of stock based compensation  including of stock based compensation  and including of stock based compensation  respectively  of costs incurred for the development of software products 
these amounts have been excluded from r d expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in capitalized 
table of contents software development costs of in as compared with was primarily due to the timing of when products reached technological feasibility 
the decrease in capitalized software costs of in as compared with was primarily due to of reduced costs capitalized for vmware vsphere as most of the vsphere costs were capitalized during the second half of this decrease was partially offset by an increase of related to the development of version of vmware vsphere  which was released in the third quarter of in  and  amortization expense from capitalized software development costs was  and these amounts are included in cost of license revenues on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the increase in the amortization of software development costs of in compared with was primarily due to the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of and the subsequent release of version in the third quarter of this resulted in an increase in amortization of in as compared with that was partially offset by of amortization for certain capitalized projects that were fully amortized prior to the end of the increase in the amortization of software development costs of in compared with was primarily due to the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of  which resulted in an increase in amortization of in as compared with other operating expenses other operating expenses  which consist of employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions  intangible amortization and acquisition related items  were in  in and in  representing an increase of in and a decrease of in the increase in was primarily due to additional intangible amortization of  primarily resulting from new acquisitions  as well as an increase of in employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  which was driven by the increase in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold or vested 
the decrease in was primarily due to expensed in process research and development of in  which was not repeated in  and a decrease of resulting from the completion of intangible amortization related to historical acquisitions 
investment income investment income decreased by or to in  as compared with in investment income decreased by or in  as compared with in investment income primarily consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances partially offset by the amortization of premiums paid on fixed income securities 
investment income decreased in compared with primarily due to a decrease in the average rate of interest earned as a result of lower market interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by higher yields earned on our fixed income securities during the second half of and increased cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
during the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities in order to achieve investment returns in line with our objectives of principal preservation and risk management 
investment income decreased in compared with primarily due to a decrease in the average rate of interest earned as a result of lower market interest rates

these losses were partially offset by a gain of recognized in the third quarter of from the remeasurement to fair value of a previously held equity interest in springsource in connection with the acquisition of springsource 
the change in compared with was primarily due to the aforementioned gain of recognized in  partially offset by losses on foreign currency transactions 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was as compared with for and for the higher effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to a jurisdictional shift of income from lower tax jurisdictions to the united states  which was offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before income tax 
the increase in the effective rate to in from in was mainly attributable to an increase in unrecognized tax positions as a percent of income before tax  offset by the increase in the favorable impact of tax credits relative to income before tax 
the tax rate is expected to be higher than the fiscal year tax rate primarily due to a forecasted shift of earnings from lower tax jurisdictions to the united states and a lower us federal r d tax credit  partially offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax positions as a percent of income before income tax 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year is based upon the income for the year  the composition of the income in different countries  and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences related to the resolution of audits or changes in uncertain tax positions 
our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the united states 
we have been included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and expect to continue to be included in such consolidated group for periods in which emc owns at least of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock as calculated for us federal income tax purposes 
the percentage of voting power and value calculated for us federal income tax purposes may differ from the percentage of outstanding shares beneficially owned by emc due to the greater voting power of our class b common stock as compared to our class a common stock and other factors 
each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon 
should emc s ownership fall below of the total voting power or value of our outstanding stock in any period  then we would no longer be included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and thus no longer be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred  but not discharged  by any other member of the emc consolidated group 
additionally  our us federal income tax would be reported separately from that of the emc consolidated group 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  changes in our international organization  shifts in the amount of income before tax earned in the us as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
liquidity and capital resources during the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities  which drove a shift from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
our fixed income investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars and consists of various holdings  types and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed 
table of contents income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our operating activities in  and  respectively  generated sufficient cash to meet our operating needs 
our cash flows for the years ended  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in evaluating our liquidity internally  we focus on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flows and in non gaap cash flows from operating activities non gaap operating cash flows 
we define non gaap operating cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized software development costs plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we define free cash flows  also a non gaap financial measure  as non gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures 
see non gaap financial measures for additional information 
our non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows for  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities capitalized software development costs excess tax benefits from stock based compensation non gaap operating cash flows capital expenditures free cash flows free cash flows increased by or to  for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   and by or to for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in free cash flows in and was primarily due to increased sales and related cash collections 
historically  we have invested excess cash predominantly in money market securities that are liquid and of high quality investment grade 
the fair value for money market securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date 
we limit the amount of our domestic and international investments with any single issuer and any single financial institution  and also monitor the diversity of the portfolio  thereby diversifying the credit risk 
in the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities 
as of december   we held a diversified portfolio of money market funds and fixed income securities  which 
table of contents primarily consist of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  us municipal obligations  and us and foreign corporate debt securities 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in and to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  amortization of premiums paid upon purchase of investments in our fixed income portfolio  stock based compensation expense  deferred income taxes  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and other adjustments 
net changes in assets and liabilities were impacted by increases in unearned revenues in the periods presented  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
cash provided by operating activities increased by to  in  as compared with in the increase in operating cash flows for was the result of an increase in cash collections from customers driven by strong sales volume 
the increase in cash collections was partially offset by increases in our core operating expenses  primarily related to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions as well as an increase in the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation due to the increase in market value of our stock 
cash flows from operating activities in were positively impacted by the collection of from emc related to the joint income tax return with emc 
the receivable was due to our stand alone taxable loss for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to tax deductions arising from both non qualified stock option exercises and from restricted stock where the restrictions lapsed 
under the tax sharing agreement with emc  emc is obligated to pay us an amount equal to the tax benefit that emc will recognize on its tax return 
in  the receipt was offset by the payment of for our portion of emc s consolidated federal and state income taxes for various periods  as well as the conclusion of the and federal income tax audit 
investing activities cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the purchase of fixed income securities  business acquisitions  capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs 
cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to the sales or maturities of fixed income securities 
we began investing in fixed income securities during the second quarter of to achieve our objective of an appropriate investment return consistent with the preservation of principal and management of risk 
total fixed income securities of  purchased in are classified as cash outflows from investing activities 
we classify these investments as short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the nature of the security and their availability for use in current operations or for other purposes  such as business acquisitions and strategic investments 
these cash outflows were partially offset by a cash inflow of as a result of the sales and maturities of these fixed income securities 
in  we acquired certain software product technology and expertise from emc s ionix it management business for and paid in contingent amounts to emc 
the net assets and expertise acquired from emc constituted a business and were accounted for as a business combination between entities under common control 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for further information 

table of contents during  we paid for various business acquisitions as compared with paid for springsource in and for various acquisitions in business acquisitions are an important element in our industry and we expect to continue to consider additional strategic acquisitions in the future 
financing activities proceeds from the issuance of our class a common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the vmware employee stock purchase plan espp  were  and in  and  respectively 
in  the timing of purchases under our espp was amended and  as a result  we completed two espp purchases of shares in with aggregate proceeds of  while in we completed one espp purchase with proceeds of in  the cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of in to repurchase shares of our class a common stock as part of our stock repurchase program 
in march  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program  authorizing the purchase of up to of our class a common stock through the end of from time to time  subject to market conditions  stock is purchased pursuant to this program in the open market or through private transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
in  we repurchased and retired million shares of our class a common stock at a weighted average price of per share under the stock repurchase program that we announced in march as of december   authorized funds of remained available under the stock repurchase program 
there were additional cash outflows of  and in  and  respectively  to repurchase shares of our class a common stock to cover tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock 
additionally  the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation was  and in  and  respectively  and is shown as a reduction to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
the year over year change in the repurchase of shares and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation in was primarily due to the increase in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold or vested 
the year over year change in the repurchase of shares and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation in was primarily due to the decline in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold  or vested 
future cash proceeds from issuances of common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and future cash outflows to repurchase our shares to cover tax withholding obligations will depend upon  and could fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the market value of our stock  the number of awards exercised  sold or vested  the tax benefit realized and the tax affected compensation recognized 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non gaap financial information 
our measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
core operating expenses management uses the non gaap measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods  for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes  for short and long term operating plans  to calculate bonus payments and to evaluate our financial performance  the performance of its individual functional groups and the ability of operations to generate cash 
management believes that core 
table of contents operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business  as they exclude certain expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results 
we define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses 
in each case  for the reasons set forth below  management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management  in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
stock based compensation 
although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  determining the fair value of the stock based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
furthermore  unlike cash compensation  the value of stock based compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors  such as market volatility  that are beyond our control 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs can vary significantly depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
other expenses 
other expenses excluded are employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items 
the amount of employer payroll taxes on stock based compensation is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business 
regarding the amortization of intangible assets  a portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions is generally allocated to intangible assets  such as intellectual property  and is subject to amortization 
however  we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle 
additionally  the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
acquisition related items include direct costs of acquisitions  such as transaction fees  which vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
additionally  we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle 
non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows we define non gaap operating cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized software development costs plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we define free cash flows as non gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures 
management uses non gaap operating cash flows as another measure of cash flows from operations because this measure offers a perspective of our operating cash flows that aligns with how management internally views our overall and individual functional group operating results 
when viewing operating results for evaluating our past performance and for planning purposes  management excludes certain items  including the effect of capitalizing and amortizing software development costs and items related to stock based compensation  which are also excluded in the non gaap operating cash flows measure 
management uses free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business  as it balances operating results  cash management and capital efficiency 
in addition to quarterly free cash flows  management also focuses on trailing twelve month free cash flows  as free cash flows can be volatile in the short term 
we believe that our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows provide useful information to investors and others  as they allow for meaningful period to period comparisons of our operating cash flows for analysis of trends in our business 
additionally  we believe that information regarding non gaap 
table of contents operating cash flows and free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on cash that we may choose to make available for strategic acquisitions and investments  the repurchase of shares  ongoing operations and other capital expenditures 
we deduct capitalization of software development costs from both measures because these costs are considered to be a necessary component of our ongoing operations and the amount capitalized under gaap can vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
consequently  software development costs paid out during a period that are capitalized under gaap and do not impact gaap operating cash flows for that period do result in a decrease to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and non gaap free cash flows  thereby providing management with useful measures of cash flows generated from operations during the period 
we add back the excess income tax benefits from stock based compensation to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows as management internally views cash flows arising from income taxes as similar to operating cash flows rather than as financing cash flows as required under gaap 
furthermore  we exclude capital expenditures on property and equipment from free cash flows because these expenditures are also considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations 
limitations on the use of non gaap financial measures a limitation of our non gaap financial measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our non gaap measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
additionally  in the case of stock based compensation  if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes  the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 
further  the non gaap measure of core operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the gaap measure of total operating expenses 
we compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety  not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 
see results of operations operating expenses for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  for the years ended december   and see liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows to the most comparable gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities  for the years ended december   and off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  
table of contents trademark  trade secret  and or other intellectual property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury  or the acts or omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have agreements with certain vendors  financial institutions  lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters  such as acts and omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that we have obtained the right to use in our products and agreements 
under some of these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors and executive officers  to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer 
our by laws and charter also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer 
we also indemnify certain employees who provide service with respect to employee benefits plans  including the members of the administrative committee of the vmware k plan 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the former directors and officers of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons 
we typically purchase a tail directors and officers insurance policy  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification obligations related to the former officers and directors of an acquired company 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable to emc operating leases other agreements sub total uncertain tax positions total includes payments from january  through december  includes payments from january  through december  
table of contents the note is due and payable in full on april   however  we can pay down the note at an earlier date in full or in part at our election 
our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world 
consisting of various contractual agreements  which include commitments on the lease for our washington data center facility 
as of december   we had of non current net unrecognized tax benefits under generally accepted accounting guidance 
we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the critical accounting policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a  overview and basis of presentation  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of software and related services 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we recognize license revenues from the sale of software licenses when risk of loss transfers  which is generally upon electronic shipment 
we primarily license our software under perpetual licenses through our channel of distributors  resellers  system vendors  systems integrators and our direct sales force 
to the extent we offer product promotions and the promotional products are not yet available  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product obligations have been fulfilled 
we defer revenues relating to products that have shipped into our channel until our products are sold through the channel 
we estimate and record reserves for products that are not sold through the channel based on historical trends and relevant current information 
we obtain sell through information from distributors and certain resellers on a monthly basis and reconcile any estimates  if necessary  made in the previous month 
historically  actual information has not differed materially from the related estimate 
for our channel partners who do not report sell through data  we determine sell through based on payment of such distributors and certain resellers accounts receivable balances and other relevant factors 
for software sold by system vendors that is bundled with their hardware  unless we have a separate license agreement with the end user  revenue is recognized in arrears upon the receipt of binding royalty reports 
the accuracy of our reserves depends on our ability to estimate the product sold through the channels and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we offer rebates to certain channel partners  which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related product sale is recognized 
when rebates are based on the set percentage of actual sales  we recognize the costs of the rebates as a reduction of revenue when the underlying revenue is recognized 
in cases where rebates are earned if a cumulative level of sales is achieved  we recognize the cost of the rebates as a reduction of revenue proportionally for each sale that is required to achieve the target 
the estimated reserves for channel 
table of contents rebates and sales incentives are based on channel partners actual performance against the terms and conditions of the programs  historical trends and the value of the rebates 
the accuracy of these reserves for these rebates and sales incentives depends on our ability to estimate these items and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
with limited exceptions  vmware s return policy does not allow product returns for a refund 
certain distributors and resellers may rotate stock when new versions of a product are released 
we estimate future product returns at the time of sale 
our estimate is based on historical return rates  levels of inventory held by distributors and resellers and other relevant factors 
the accuracy of these reserves depends on our ability to estimate sales returns and stock rotation among other criteria 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
returns have not been material to date and have been in line with our expectations 
our services revenues consist of software maintenance and professional services 
we recognize software maintenance revenues ratably over the contract period 
typically  our contract periods range from one to five years 
professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products because services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours and direct expenses incurred 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based upon hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments regarding our services revenues  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts or the stated renewal rate for software maintenance included in the license agreement 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
if we are unable to establish vsoe of fair value for one of the undelivered elements included in a multiple element contract  the revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value for the undelivered element has been established or the element has been delivered 
if the element involves time based delivery  the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the delivery period 
customers under software maintenance agreements are entitled to receive updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis  and various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
in the event specific features or functionalities  entitlements or the release number of an upgrade have been announced but not delivered  and customers will receive that upgrade as part of a current software maintenance contract  a specified upgrade is deemed created and product revenues are deferred on purchases made after the announcement date until delivery of the upgrade 
the amount and elements to be deferred are dependent on whether the company has established vsoe of fair value for the upgrade 
vsoe of fair value of these upgrades is established based upon the price set by management 
we have a history of selling such upgrades on a stand alone basis 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent with the sale of these elements on a stand alone basis 
this determination could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

table of contents accounting for stock options generally accepted accounting principles require recognizing compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value 
we elected to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards and options under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of our share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate associated with the expected term of the awards  expected dividends and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  this could have a material impact on our financial statements 
capitalized software development costs costs related to r d are generally charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization of material development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization from the time technological feasibility is established until the product is available for general release 
judgment is required to determine when technological feasibility is established 
changes in judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  would likely materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability declines in the future  the amount of costs capitalized would likely decrease 
in addition  our r d expenses and amounts capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
generally accepted accounting principles require annual amortization expense of capitalized software development costs to be the greater of the amounts computed using the ratio of current gross revenue to a product s total current and anticipated revenues  or the straight line method over the product s remaining estimated economic life 
to date  we amortized these costs using the straight line method as it is the greater of the two amounts 
the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
material differences in amortization amounts could occur as a result of changes in the periods over which we actually generate revenues or the amounts of revenues generated 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt expense could exceed our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period during which the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
as we operate our business in one operating segment and one reporting unit  our goodwill is assessed at the consolidated level for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assessment is performed by comparing the market value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 

table of contents accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  management judgment is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we do not provide for a us income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the earnings of non us subsidiaries  which reflect full provision for non us income taxes  are indefinitely reinvested in non us operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax 
income taxes are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although we are included in the consolidated tax return of emc 
the difference between the income taxes payable that is calculated on a separate return basis and the amount actually paid to emc pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with emc is presented as a component of additional paid in capital 
new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
these new standards affect the determination of when individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
in addition  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across separately identified deliverables  eliminate the use of the residual value method of allocating arrangement consideration and require expanded disclosure 
these new standards became effective for us for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we have determined that these new standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as our business is currently conducted 
software in september  the fasb issued amended standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these new standards amend pre existing software revenue 
table of contents guidance by removing from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s functionality 
these amended standards became effective for us for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we have determined that these new standards are not applicable to our business and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidations in december  the fasb issued standards for consolidation of variable interest entities vies primarily related to the determination of the primary beneficiary of the vie 
these amended standards became effective for us on january  the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
these amended standards may  however  have an impact on accounting for any changes to existing relationships or future investments

additionally  a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  sales and sales support and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar and the indian rupee 
revenues resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income 
as exchange rates vary  operating margins may differ materially from expectations 
operating expenses were negatively impacted by million in and million in  and benefited by million in  due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies as compared with the same period in the prior year 
we calculate the foreign currency impact on our operating expenses as the difference between operating expenses translated at current exchange rates and the same expenses translated at prior period exchange rates 
given that we began to invoice and collect in currencies other than the us dollar during the second quarter of  we will not be able to determine the year over year impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues for the periods disclosed until we have a full year of prior year comparable information 
to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize derivative financial instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities against movements in certain foreign exchange rates 
our foreign currency forward contracts are generally traded on a monthly basis with a typical contractual term of one month 
as of december   we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of million as of december  this sensitivity analysis disregards any potentially offsetting gain that may be associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that vmware hedges 

table of contents this analysis also assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we do not enter into speculative foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk fixed income securities during the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities 
our fixed income investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars and consists of various holdings  types and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
hypothetical changes in interest rates of basis points and basis points would have changed the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio as of december  by million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates  however  interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risk  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during these instruments are not leveraged and we do not enter into speculative securities for trading purposes 
see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
note payable to emc as of december   million was outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet in relation to the note payable with emc 
the interest rate on the note payable was as of both december  and and as of december  in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable 
the note may be repaid  without penalty  at any time 
the note matures in april and bears an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest rate on the note resets quarterly and is determined on the two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
if the interest rate on the note payable were to change basis points from the december  rate and assuming no additional repayments on the principal were made  our annual interest expense would change by million 
equity price risk our investments in equity securities expose us to market risk associated with publicly traded equity securities 
these investments are classified as short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change of and in the publicly traded price for our investments in equity securities would have changed the fair value of these investments by million and million  respectively  as of december
