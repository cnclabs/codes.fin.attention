item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion includes the following sections overview results of operations operating segments liquidity and capital resources environment critical accounting estimates new accounting standards forward looking statements overview operating results improved in all of our operating segments in when compared to last year 
despite supply chain variability in the lcd market  operating results in our display technologies segment were up significantly in compared to  due to robust retail demand for lcd products 
strength in enterprise network products sales  coupled with cost reduction efforts  drove higher results in our telecommunications segment in when compared to last year 
in addition  sales increased in in our environmental technologies segment reflecting improvements in the global automotive market and in the truck market in the united states 
results in our specialty materials segment were significantly higher in compared to  driven by strong demand for corning gorilla glass and our display optics and components products 
results in the life sciences segment were higher due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed at the end of the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of earnings comparisons to last year also benefited from certain non operating items that are described in our discussion of profitability below 
corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence 
this strategy has served us well 
our key priorities for were similar to those of the previous four years protect our financial health and invest in the future 
during  we made the following progress on these priorities financial health despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment  our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following our debt to capital ratio at was unchanged from december  operating cash flow for the year was billion 
we ended the year with over billion of cash and short term investments  which was approximately billion higher than last year 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for when compared to last year  the increase in net income was due largely to the following items higher net income in the display technologies segment reflected strong demand for lcd glass at both our wholly owned business and our equity affiliate samsung corning precision  offset somewhat by lower prices 
higher net income in the environmental technologies segment reflected higher volumes in both automotive and diesel products  as well as improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts 
a tax benefit in the amount of million for excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
an increase of million or in equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning resulting from improved volume at hemlock semiconductor corporation hemlock  dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  and non recurring favorable tax items in the amount of million 

table of contents settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims impacting our display technologies segment in the amount of million pre tax  coupled with the absence of related costs in the amount of million for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs recorded in the absence of restructuring charges in totaling million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments 
the increase in net income in was favorably impacted by million from the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems 
we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises 
in  we broadened our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities 
these opportunities  which include products such as corning gorilla glass for consumer products and thin film photovoltaics for solar applications  leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications 
while we continued to make investments in these promising technologies in  we decided to discontinue our development and commercialization of synthetic green laser technologies in the fourth quarter 
in  our innovation strategy will continue to focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities 
our research  development and engineering expenditures increased by million in when compared to  but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales 
we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
in the third quarter of  we announced multi year investment plans for additional manufacturing capacity that will benefit a number of our segments 
the plans include million for spending associated with a new lcd glass substrate facility in the people s republic of china to meet expected growing demand for our lcd glass 
spending for this facility began in september of and we expect production to begin in additional investments will include construction projects in other regions to expand capacity for eagle xg lcd glass substrates and will benefit our specialty materials segment by providing capacity for increased demand of corning gorilla glass 
the plans also include spending in the environmental technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in shanghai  china and kaiserslautern  germany 
additionally  the plans establish a life sciences manufacturing and distribution facility in wujiang  china 
these facilities are expected to be operational in and total capital expenditures for were billion 
approximately million was directed toward our display technologies segment in approximately million in was invested in our specialty materials segment 
we expect our capital spending to be about billion to billion 
approximately billion to billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment 
corporate outlook corning expects significant sales growth in  led by strong demand for our corning gorilla glass products 
we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass in will increase from billion square feet to approximately to billion square feet when compared to  driven by continued strength in demand for lcd televisions  computer notebooks  and desktop monitors 
earnings will be negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the absence of the tax benefits resulting from our repatriation actions  increased income in higher tax rate jurisdictions and tax holiday expirations 
equity earnings from samsung corning will also be impacted by higher taxes in cash flow from operations may decline as we expect lower dividends from equity affiliates 
we will also use more cash for investing activities as we expand our capacity to meet growing demand 
we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses 
we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation  while preserving our financial stability  will enable our continued long term success

net sales net sales in increased due to higher sales in all of our segments when compared to  driven by volume growth in all of our segments and from the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
we saw demand increase for all of our lcd products  led by strong growth of lcd televisions outside of the united states 
sales in our specialty materials segment in increased when compared to  due to strong demand for corning gorilla glass products  our thin sheet glass designed to function as a protective cover glass on display devices 
sales were also strong in both our environmental technologies and life sciences segments  up and  respectively 
net sales in decreased due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to  driven primarily by volume and price declines in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
the largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of as lcd glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions 
over the remainder of  we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and  we believe  a corresponding expansion in the lcd industry supply chain as demand for lcd televisions improved 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales increased when compared to and when compared to the third quarter of  driven by increased net sales in the display technologies segment 
for the full year of  lower volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted

corning s research  development and engineering expenses are currently focused on our display technologies  environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments 
excluding these segments  the largest driver of spending continues to be for adjacent products such as corning gorilla glass  and research for new business development 
we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
research  development  and engineering expenses decreased by million in when compared to  but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales 
reduced spending in was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts 

table of contents restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in  and  which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
a description of those charges and credits follows activity during  we had two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october  production at our facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from these events  of which million was received in cash through december  activity in response to anticipated lower sales in  we recorded charges of million in primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce 
the charges included costs for severance  special termination benefits  outplacement services  and the impact of a million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately million  with the majority of spending completed by we estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
activity in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 
asbestos litigation in  we recorded a decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of million compared to a net increase of million in the net decrease in was due primarily to a million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of  as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims 
for the remainder of  we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 
in  we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million compared to a net decrease of million in the net decrease in was due primarily to a million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of  as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in for the remainder of  we recorded net credit adjustments of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 
our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be million at december   compared with an estimate of million at december  the entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective  and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning s investment in pce currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions years ended december  samsung corning precision dow corning all other total equity earnings 
table of contents the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in reflected strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to last year 
equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of increased volume  a non recurring tax benefit and movements in foreign exchange rates  offset somewhat by price declines  when compared to the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in was driven by samsung corning precision when compared to the same period last year 
equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected increased volume  manufacturing efficiency gains  and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates  offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 
the increase in equity earnings from dow corning in when compared to was primarily due to the following items an increase in sales of  resulting from strength in dow corning s traditional silicone products and improved volume at hemlock semiconductor corporation hemlock  dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  the positive impact of advanced energy manufacturing tax credits approved by the us government for dow corning s manufacturing expansion projects that support the solar industry 
corning s share of these credits was million  the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets 
the impact to corning was million  and the absence of restructuring charges in the amount of million recorded in for our share of costs associated with dow corning s global workforce reduction 
the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at dow corning  offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year 
sales at dow corning declined in when compared to and included volume declines in dow corning s traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at hemlock 
sales of dow corning s traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in sales at hemlock increased in  driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from dow corning 
sales at dow corning in are expected to increase when compared to  driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at hemlock 
in the first quarter of  equity earnings from dow corning are expected to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of other income expense  net other income expense  net in corning s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions years ended december  royalty income from samsung corning precision foreign currency transaction and hedge losses gains loss on retirement of debt net realized losses of available for sale securities loss on sale of steuben glass business net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests other  net total income before income taxes in addition to the items identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other credits and charges  asbestos litigation credit charge  and other income expense  net  movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions years ended december  provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  and the impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our opeb liability 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of the us research and experimentation tax credit for years  the benefit of recording additional deferred tax assets for a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our opeb liability  and the impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax benefit rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the release of billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of us deferred tax assets in future years  described below  the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions  and a million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the canadian revenue agency 
as more fully described in note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements  all of our us deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of at that time  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result  we released billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance was needed 
the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective 
following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of positive pre tax income in the us for the first half of and the preceding year  the impact of positive results in the display technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment  the number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels  which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses 

table of contents at june   the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment  but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence uncertainty of future taxable earnings  historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non recurring items  and economic and consumer demand uncertainty 
deferred tax liabilities totaled million at december   and therefore  were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets 
in  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
the impact of the release of the valuation allowances  and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us  was a reduction in our effective tax rate of percentage points for certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as other federal and state tax credits  will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december   because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
us profits of approximately billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  of that amount  billion of us profits will be required over the next years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards 
the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period 
the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
as of december   taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of  and percentage points for  and  respectively 
while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next months  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above  net income and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts years ended december  net income attributable to corning incorporated basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share shares used in computing per share amounts basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share 
table of contents operating segments our reportable operating segments are as follows display technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays 
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry 
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications 
this reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
specialty materials manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in as a result of the change in our tax position  we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in to reflect this difference 
the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant

table of contents when compared to last year  the increase in net income in primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our wholly owned business and samsung corning precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims  partially offset by price declines 
the insurance settlement relates to two events in which impacted production at our lcd glass manufacturing facilities 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october  production at our facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
we recorded a pre tax credit in in the amount of million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events

the decrease in net sales in reflected price declines of and a decline in volume of measured in square feet of glass sold  offset somewhat by the positive impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates 
net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
when compared to  the volume decline in occurred largely in the first quarter of and reflected a number of industry dynamics 
because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers  supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning s volume 
during the second half of  the lcd market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined 
we believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of  followed by replenishment in the second quarter 
over the remainder of  we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales increased when compared to the same period in and when compared to the third quarter of with increasing demand over the course of  we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of as described above  in  an earthquake in shizuoka  japan halted production at the company s lcd glass manufacturing facility and production at the company s lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support lcd glass shipments 
we believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust 
the company incurred approximately million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs from these events 
in  equity earnings of samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of offset somewhat by price declines of when compared to the same period in equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
results of samsung corning precision reflected improvements in the overall lcd glass market  which grew approximately in when compared to the economic recession had a greater impact on our wholly owned business in taiwan than on samsung corning precision 
since taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition  they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand 
when compared to  the decline in net income in was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines  costs associated with the earthquake in japan  and restructuring charges in the first quarter of these items were offset somewhat by million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings 
net income of this segment in included million of restructuring charges associated with the company s corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in net income also includes royalty income from samsung corning precision  which was higher in when compared to reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision

table of contents other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan 
for and  three customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for and  respectively  of total segment sales when combined 
our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market 
while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues  our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in and  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately of samsung corning precision sales in each of those two years 
corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates 
in  and  capital spending in this segment was million  million  and billion  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be approximately to billion 
in and  several of corning s customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which corning s display technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
we received our last deposit of million in july and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 
during  and  we issued million  million  and million  respectively  in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 
in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
outlook we expect the overall lcd glass market in to be approximately to billion square feet 
this is an increase over  which was billion square feet 
demand will be driven by continued growth of lcd televisions  particularly in emerging regions such as china 
we expect industry glass supply and demand to be relatively in balance and quarterly sequential glass price declines to be moderate 
we believe that the long term drivers of the lcd market will be lcd television growth  driven by increased demand in emerging regions and a faster replacement cycle  as well as continued growth in the personal computer market 
in the first quarter of  we expect volume at our wholly owned business and at samsung corning precision to increase by the mid single digits when compared to the fourth quarter of we expect sequential price declines in the first quarter of to be more moderate than those in the fourth quarter of the end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending  among other things 
we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions  particularly the global economic recession  and world political tensions could have on consumer demand 
while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years  economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment

actions in this segment included workforce reductions  the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 
outlook we expect net sales of the telecommunications segment to be up approximately in  driven by an increase in global demand for our fiber to the premises products and enterprise network products  as well as from the impact of a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we expect net sales of this segment to be consistent with the fourth quarter of changes in our customers expected deployment plans  or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products  could also affect sales levels

table of contents at the time a guarantee is issued  the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities 
none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning s consolidated statements of position 
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity

environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by the agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  corning had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  follow 
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals  primarily platinum and rhodium 
these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life 
precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets 
this review considers all of the company s precious metals that are either in place in the production process  in reclamation  fabrication  or refinement in anticipation of re use  or awaiting use to support increased capacity 
precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes 
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for the majority of our reporting segments  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
the fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets  and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth  market share  projected selling prices  manufacturing cost and discount rate 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable 
at december   the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by million 
at december   the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by million 
currently these precious metal assets  primarily in the display technologies segment  are recoverable as part of their asset groupings 
there is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments 
such events include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in demand for products of our display technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability 
variable interest entities the company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities 
these investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests 
a variable interest entity vie is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a vie is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
the determination of whether an entity is a vie and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk  the evaluation of contractual arrangements  and assessments about forecasted information 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  changes in these judgments or estimates could affect corning s results 
effective january   the company adopted required changes to consolidation guidance for variable interest entities that require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity  or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
in addition  the required changes provide guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships  remove the scope exemption for qualified special purpose entities  revise the definition of a variable interest entity  and require additional disclosures 
the adoption of this standard was not material to corning s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
for variable interest entities  we routinely assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
none of these entities is considered significant to corning s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
as disclosed in note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements  corning s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications  specialty materials and life sciences operating segments 
our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter  as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process 
this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows 
our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
periodically  the detailed determination of fair value is carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria are met 
in  an assessment of all of the reporting units was performed and it was determined the criteria to carry forward the detailed determination of fair value were met  as follows assets and liabilities that make up the telecommunications  specialty materials and life sciences reporting units did not change significantly from the fourth quarter of  the fair value determination completed in the fourth quarter of for all reporting units resulted in amounts that exceeded the carrying amount by a substantial margin  and the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the carrying amount of the reporting units is remote based on analysis of events that have occurred since the fair value assessment was completed in telecommunications goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the operating segment level 
we have aggregated the telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment reviews based on the manner in which we operate our businesses  the vertically integrated nature of these operations  shared assets  operating and finance resources  and management  the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment  and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity 
results for the telecommunications segment in were up when compared with we anticipate higher sales in as demand increases for fiber to the home products and outside plant cable products 
in  the results of our review of the telecommunications segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our evaluation  which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in a range of to would not have changed our conclusion 
specialty materials goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the component level  which is one level below an operating segment  because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment 
although the specialty materials segment had small reported losses in and  we anticipate growth in new products will improve longer term profitability 
in  the results of our review of the specialty materials segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our evaluation  which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in a range of to would not have changed our conclusion 
life sciences goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level 
we have aggregated the life sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses 
results in the life sciences segment in were up when compared to  reflecting the positive impact of axygen  an acquisition which was completed in the third quarter of in  the results of our review of the life sciences segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our evaluation  which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount

restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas  including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment 
we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
in the second quarter of  we released billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets 
a key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of lcd televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household  faster lcd television replacement rates  the continued decline of cathode ray tube products  and growth in emerging markets such as china 
another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we released an additional million  and million  respectively  of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of us taxable income 
significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the long term stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment  the long term growth of our diesel business  and the future success of new products 
equity method investments at december  and  the carrying value of our equity method investments was billion and billion  respectively  with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately of the balance 
we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired 
when such indicators are present  we then perform an in depth review for impairment 
an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability  forecasted tax rates  foreign currency exchange rate movements  terminal value assumptions  historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 
fair value measures as required  corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable 
observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources  while unobservable inputs are based on the company s own market assumptions 
once inputs have been characterized  we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels 
characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement 
in addition  observable market data must be used when available 
corning s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments  pension asset investments and derivatives 
these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

table of contents derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in arriving at the fair value of corning s derivative assets and liabilities  we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria  including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction 
amounts related to credit risk are not material 
probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see part ii item legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties 
any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal 
for these and other reasons  corning s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters 
the estimate of the cost of resolving the non pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur 
management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was billion 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effect on december  pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  and a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 

table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans change in assumption effect on pre tax opeb expense effect on december  apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen  euro  new taiwan dollar and korean won 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments were billion and billion in and  respectively  with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled billion for and billion for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the euro  a adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results  we compare actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a change in the currency exchange rate 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
using net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of  we can estimate that a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
