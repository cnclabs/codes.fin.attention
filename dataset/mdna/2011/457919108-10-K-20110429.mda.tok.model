item selected financial data not required for smaller reporting companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees from three hotels owned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates and trademark license fees from one hotel owned by a non related third party 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
supply of hotels has increased in the markets we operate  particularly in the yuma  arizona and ontario  california markets 
market demand has declined in the tucson  arizona market 
either a further increase in supply or a further decline in demand could result in increased competition  which could have an adverse effect on the revenue of the hotels in their respective markets 
weak economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a negative impact on our operations in fiscal years and we anticipate moderate improvement in these conditions during fiscal year we expect moderate improvements in overall economic conditions to result in improved business and leisure travel and relatively steady room rates 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be the continuation of strong competition for group and other business in the markets in which we operate  which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and by carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under guidance codified in the accounting standards codification asc topic related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership we owned a interest in three of the hotels and a in one of the hotels  and we owned a direct interest in one hotel 
at january  through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership we owned a interest in four of the hotels and we owned a direct interest in one hotel 
we did not purchase any partnership units during the year ended january  we purchased  partnership units during the year ended january  our expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll  guest and maintenance supplies  marketing and utilities expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
in fiscal year  occupancy decreased to from in the prior year 
adr decreased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreased occupancy and rates reflect the softened economy and travel industry during fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that occupancy  adr and revpar will not increase or decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  overview a summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended january  and is change change revenue operating loss net loss attributable to controlling interest loss per share basic loss per share diluted our overall results in fiscal year were negatively affected by the challenging overall economic environment and the hospitality industry in particular 
for the twelve months ended january   we had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in total revenue is primarily due to lower occupancies and rates at the hotels  resulting in decreased room revenues 
during fiscal year  we expect improvements in occupancy and modest improvements in rates 
total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflect a decrease of approximately  compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to reduced advertising expenditures and reduced payroll expense under the management contracts 
general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  were consistent with the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended january  and  respectively 
total operating expenses for the twelve months ended january  were million  a decrease of approximately  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to reduced advertising expenditures and reduced payroll expense under the management contracts 
total interest expense for the twelve months ended january  was million  consistent with the prior year total 
interest on other notes payable increased  or greater than  to  from  during the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase is due to large share repurchases using promissory notes in the last half of fiscal year we had a consolidated net loss before income taxes of million for the twelve months ended january   compared to million in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the minority interest of  we had a net loss attributable to controlling interests of approximately million for fiscal year  which represented approximately  in additional net loss attributable to controlling interests as compared to the twelve months ended january  basic and diluted net loss per share was for the twelve months ended january   compared to for fiscal year the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to reduced business levels at the hotel properties 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to our shareholders  is our share of the partnership s cash flow and our direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
our liquidity  including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  will depend upon our ability and the partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  both of which decreased from fiscal year to  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which reduces our profit margins on rented suites 
in past years  we have relied on our cash flows from operations and hotel refinancings to meet our financial obligations as they come due 
for the remainder of fiscal year april  through january   our management has projected that cash flows from operations alone may not be sufficient to meet all of our financial obligations as they become due during fiscal year based on this projection  we began syndicating up to of our ownership in the tucson oracle hotel property by entering into a restructuring agreement on february  the first funds related to this syndication were received on april  the syndication will be conducted in the same manner as our albuquerque property in fiscal year additionally  the trust s management is actively working to extend our  bank line of credit which matures in may with the expected proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in the tucson oracle hotel property and the availability of the  bank line of credit  management believes that it will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial obligations as they become due  assuming the extension or refinance of the mortgage note payable secured by the ontario hotel property 
the trust s management is currently working with the current lender to obtain a one year or longer extension on the ontario hotel property mortgage to allow us to obtain long term refinancing of the mortgage note during the next twelve months or longer 
the trust s management is also actively discussing a potential refinance with other lenders 
in addition  due to the economy  our management has analyzed other strategic options available to us  including the refinancing of another property or raising additional funds through additional minority interest sales 
we anticipate a moderate improvement in the weak overall economic situation that negatively affected results in fiscal year  which could result in higher revenues and operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for all types of business in the markets in which we operate and our ability to maintain room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to reduced business levels and room rates at the hotel properties  reflecting the slow economy and its impact on the travel industry 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase in funds used in as compared to was due to increased capital refurbishment projects  primarily at the yuma  arizona hotel property 
net cash provided by used in financing activities totaled million and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the million of funds raised in the sale of non controlling interests in the albuquerque subsidiary 
as of january   we had no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
we continue to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund an amount equal to of the innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for four of our properties 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and  respectively  for capital expenditures 
we consider the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
we plan to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
we have minimum debt payments of million and  due during fiscal years and  respectively 
the mortgage note payable secured by the ontario  california property matures in may  at which time a final principal payment of approximately million will be due 
we are actively seeking to either extend our current loan agreement or refinance the balance with another lender 
our ability to extend or refinance the ontario note will depend on several factors  including the condition of credit markets and economic trends in both the hospitality industry in general and at the property specifically 
on march   we established an  revolving line of credit 
the line of credit matured on june  on november   the trust established a new revolving bank line of credit  with a credit limit of  the line of credit bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum with a rate floor  has no financial covenants and matures on may  the trust s management is actively working with the lender to extend this line of credit 
if the trust maintains bank balances of at least  with the lender  the line of credit bears interest at the prime rate plus with a rate floor 
the line is secured by a junior security interest in the yuma  arizona property and trade receivables 
mr 
wirth is a guarantor on the new line of credit 
as of january   the trust had drawn no funds under the line of credit 
as of january   we had mortgage notes payable of million outstanding with respect to the hotels   in secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the share of beneficial interest and partnership unit repurchases  and no principal due and payable under notes and advances payable to mr 
wirth and his affiliates 
management believes that cash on hand  available funds on its bank line of credit  proceeds from the sale of minority ownership interests in the tucson oracle property and future cash receipts from operations in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months  assuming the extension or refinance of the mortgage note secured by the ontario hotel property  which the trust s management is actively working on extending 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as we consider prudent

compliance with continued listing standards of nyse amex on september   the trust received a letter from the nyse amex llc the nyse amex informing the trust that the staff of the nyse amex corporate compliance department has determined that the trust is not in compliance with section a ii of the nyse amex company guide due to the trust having stockholders equity of less than million and losses from continuing operations in three of its four most recent fiscal years 
the nyse amex letter informed the trust that  to maintain its listing  it was required to submit a plan of compliance by november   addressing how it intended to regain compliance with the nyse amex continued listing standards within a maximum of months 
the nyse amex letter provided that if the plan submitted by the trust were accepted by the nyse amex  the trust would likely be able to continue its listing during the month plan period  during which time it would be subject to periodic review to determine whether it was making progress consistent with the trust plan 
the trust submitted its plan on november  the plan includes improved hotel operating profits as the economy and hospitality industry continue to recover  the sale of membership interests in the albuquerque entity above carrying value  and the potential sale of membership interests in other hotel properties owned by the trust and partnership above carrying value 
the trust expects to regain compliance within the month plan period 
future positioning in viewing the hotel industry cycles  the board of trustees determined that may have been the high point of the current hotel industry cycle and further determined it was appropriate to actively seek buyers for our properties 
we engaged the services of several hotel brokers and began independently advertising our hotels for sale 
we continue to independently advertise our hotels for sale 
our long term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity and to migrate our focus from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding our trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by international diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services 
we began our long term corporate strategy when we relinquished our reit income tax status in january  which had previously prevented us from providing management services to hotels 
in june  we acquired our trademark license and management agreements and began providing management  trademark and reservations services to our hotels 
the table below lists the hotel properties  their respective carrying and mortgage value and the estimated sales value for the hotel properties 
hotel property asset values as of january  hotel property book value mortgage balance listed sales price albuquerque ontario tucson oracle tucson city center yuma totals there is no assurance that the listed sales price for the individual hotel properties will be realized 
however  our management believes that these values are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales 
changes in market conditions have in part and may in the future result in our changing one or all of the sales prices 
we provide trademark licensing  management  reservation and advertising services to all the hotel properties listed above and expect to continue the trademark licensing services  which includes the reservation and advertising services  and or continue the management services  which also includes the reservation and advertising services  after the hotels are sold 
if any or all of these hotel properties are sold  our future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when we have sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  we have continued to provide management and or trademark licensing and reservation services after a sale 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future 
as part of the board study for  greater emphasis has been placed on priority for additional management  trademark and reservations fee income 
we have determined that it is easier to sell management contracts when the trademark services are also provided 
as part of the emphasis on trademark services  we have developed two trademark packages 
the first is the traditional innsuites hotels suites regional package and the second is the innsuites boutique hotel collection  which now includes three affiliate hotels managed by us 
sales and marketing for the expansion of the innsuites boutique hotel collection are being handled internally 
share repurchase program on january   the board of trustees approved a share repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  for the purchase of up to  limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on september   august  and september   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  on january   september  and january   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to   and  respectively  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
acquired shares of beneficial interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future acquisitions and financings and or for awards granted under the innsuites hospitality trust stock incentive and option plan 
during fiscal year  we acquired  shares of beneficial interest in open market transactions at an average price of per share and  shares of beneficial interest in privately negotiated transactions at an average price of per share 
the average price paid in open market transactions includes brokerage commissions 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares of beneficial interest and rrf limited partnership units in compliance with applicable legal and nyse amex requirements 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments and legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
see accounting matters below for a discussion of new accounting interpretations with respect to variable interest entities and the impact of such interpretations on us 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties  which constitute the majority of our assets  are our most critical policies 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued authoritative guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  codified in asc topic  which we apply to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  we review the carrying value of our hotel properties 
we will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation methods 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  we will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
we did not recognize impairment loss in fiscal years or as of january   our management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general and innsuites hotels in particular can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates as fast or faster than inflation 
room rates declined in the most recent fiscal year ended january  forward looking statements certain statements in this form k  including statements containing the phrases believes  intends  expects  anticipates  predicts  projects  will be  should be  looking ahead  may or similar words  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended
