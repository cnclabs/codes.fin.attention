one of our subsidiaries  cheniere marketing  llc cheniere marketing  is marketing lng and natural gas on its own behalf and on behalf of cheniere partners  and i s working to monetize lng storage and regasification capacity reserved by cheniere partners at the sabine pass lng terminal 
cheniere partners is developing a liquefaction project to provide bi directional lng import and export service at the sabine pass lng terminal 
we are in various stages of developing other lng terminal and pipeline related projects  each of which  among other things  will require acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a final investment decision 
overview of significant events our significant accomplishments during include the following in march  cheniere marketing entered into various agreements the lngco agreements with jpmorgan lng co 
lngco  an indirect subsidiary of jpmorgan chase co  effective april   providing cheniere marketing with financial support to source more cargoes of lng than it could source on a stand alone basis  in june  we used million of cash received from the sale of our interes t in freeport lng development  lp to repay a portion of our term loan described below  in june  cheniere partners initiated a project to add liquefaction services at the sabine pass lng terminal that would transform the terminal into a bi directional facility capable of liquefying natural gas and exporting lng in addition to importing and regasifying foreign sourced lng  in june  cheniere marketing assigned its terminal use agreement tua with sabine pass lng  lp sabine pass lng to cheniere investments  llc cheniere investments  a wholly owned subsidiary of cheniere partners  and as a result  we were able to use million of cash and cash equivalents held in a tua reserve account to repay a portion of the convertible term loans hereafter referred to as the loans  in june  cheniere marketing entered into the variable capacity rights agreement vcra with cheniere investments  effective july  under the terms of the vcra  cheniere marketing was contra cted by cheniere investments to monetize the regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal on its behalf in exchange for compensation based upon the profitability of each transaction undertaken by cheniere marketing  in september  sabine pass liquefaction  llc sabine liquefaction  a subsidiary of cheniere partners  received approval from the us department of energy doe to export mtpa of lng produced from domestic natural gas for over thirty years starting not later than september this lic ense authorizes sabine liquefaction to export lng to purchasers in countries which have a free trade agreement fta with the us a second application was filed with the doe requesting to expand the permit for a year period and to allow export to countries with which the us does not have an fta  in november and december of  sabine liquefaction signed memoranda of understanding with a number of potential customers for bi directional service at the sabine pass lng terminal  and in december  the loans were amended to eliminate the lenders put rights  as described herein  allow for the early prepayment of the loans  allow us to sell cheniere partners common units held as collateral and prepay the loans with the proceeds  release restrictions on prepayments of other indebtedness at cheniere as certain conditions are met  and terminate the lenders right to nominate or designate board members of cheniere and cheniere partners 
in addition  of the lenders agreed to terminate their rights to convert the loans into series b pre ferred stock of cheniere and received million shares of cheniere common stock 
liquidity and capital resources although consolidated for financial reporting  cheniere  sabine pass lng and cheniere partners operate with independent capital structures 
we expect the cash needs for sabine pass lng will be met through operating cash flows and existing unrestricted cash 
we ex pect the cash needs for cheniere partners will be met through operating cash flows from sabine pass lng  existing unrestricted cash and the issuance of cheniere partners common units 
we expect the cash needs of cheniere will be met by utilizing existing unrestricted cash  management fees from sabine pass lng and cheniere partners  distributions from our investment in cheniere partners and operating cash flows from our pipeline and lng and natural gas marketing businesses 
the following table presents in thousands cheniere restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents for each portion of our capital structure as of december  all restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by cheniere partners and sabine pass lng are restricted by cheniere as to usage or withdrawal sabine pass lng  lp cheniere energy partners  lp other cheniere energy  inc consolidated cheniere energy  inc cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and cash equivalents total as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and other working capital from lng and natural gas marketing activities of approximately million that will be available to cheniere  which excludes cash and cash equivalents available to cheniere partners and sabine pass lng 
in addition  we had restricted cash and cash equivalents of mi llion  which were designated for the following purposes million for interest payments related to the senior notes described below  million for sabine pass lng working capital  million for cheniere partners working capital  and million for other restricted purposes 
in  we accomplished the following items which we believe improved our liquidity and strengthened our capital structure in march  our liquidity position was improved by entering into the lngco agreements  which monetized our then existing lng inventory of  mmbtu  and which may reduce our working capital requirements to operate our marketing business by allowing us to source more cargoes of lng than we could source on a stand alone basis  and may provide additional financial support to monetize cheniere investments capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal and creole trail pipeline  in may  our indebtedness was reduced by the pre payment of million of principal of the term loan as a result of the sale of our limited partner interest in freeport lng 
the principal pre payment also reduced the amount of annual interest payable under the term loan by million  offsetting or potentially exceeding any freeport lng distributions we might not have received as a result of having sold our limited partner interest in freeport lng as a source of liquidity  in june  our liquidity and capital structure were improved by assigning ch eniere marketing tua to a subsidiary of cheniere partners and entering into related transactions 
we used the restricted cash that was previously reserved to fund cheniere marketing tua payment obligations to prepay million in accrued interest and million of principal on the loans 
as a result of the tua assignment and related transactions  we increased our annual cash flow by million to million  and in december  the loans were amended to eliminate the lenders put rights  as described herein  allow for the early prepayment of the loans  allow us to sell cheniere partners common units held as collateral and prepay the loans with the proceeds  release restrictions on prepayments of other indebtedness at cheniere as certain conditions are met  and terminate the lenders right to nominate or designate board members of cheniere and cheniere partners 
in addition  of the lenders agreed to terminate their rights to convert the loans into series b preferred stock of cheniere and received million shares of cheniere common stock 
we believe that cheniere excluding the sources and uses of capital by sabine pass lng and cheniere partners will have sufficient cash  other working capital and cash gen erated from its operations to fund its operating expenses and other cash requirements until at least the earliest date when principal payments may be required on its existing indebtedness  which will be in may the maturity date of the term loan 
before that date  cheniere expects to continue to restructure our finances and improve our capital structure  which will be accomplished by entering into long term agreements  refinancing our existing indebtedness  issuing equity or other securities  selling assets  or a combination of the foregoing 
lng terminal business cheniere partners our ownership interest in the sabine pass lng terminal is held through cheniere partners 
we own approximately of cheniere partners in the form of  common units   subordinated units and a general partner interest 
cheniere partners owns a interest in sabine pass lng  which is operating the sabine pass lng terminal 
we receive quarterly equity distributions from cheniere partners  and we receive management fees for managing sabine pass lng and cheniere partners 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions on our common units  million in distributions on our subordinated units and million in distributions on our general partnership interest 
we also received fees of million under our management agreements with cheniere partners and fees of million under our management agreements wit h sabine pass lng during the year ended december  the common unit and general partner distributions are being funded from cash flows generated by sabine pass lng third party tua customers 
the subordinated unit distributions we received in were funded from cash flows generated by sabine pass lng tua with cheniere marketing 
as a result of cheniere marketing assignment of its tua to cheniere investments  we have not received distributions on our subordinated units since the distribution made with respect to the quarter ended march  during the subordination period  the common units have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the initial quarterly distributions of per quarter  plus any arrearages in the payment of the initial quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units that we own 
we expect that additional cash flows generated by future business development by subsidiaries of cheniere partners would be used to make quarterly distributions on our subordinated units before any increase in distributions to the common unitholders and general partner 
we and cheniere partners amended  effective as of july   the fee structure for the various general and administrative services provided by us for cheniere partners benefit and changed it from a fixed fee to a variable fee 
the amended and restated services agreement provides that fees will be paid quarterly from cheniere partners unrestricted cash and cash equivalents remaining after making distributions to the common unitholders and the general partner in respect of each quarter and retaining certain reserves 
our ability to receive management fees from cheniere partners is dependent on our ability to  among other things  manage cheniere partners and sabine pass lng operating and administrative expenses  monetize the bcf d regasification capacity under the cheniere investments tua as discussed below and develop new projects through either internal development or acquisition to increase cash flow 
the fixed management fees payable by sabine pass lng remain unchanged 
in june  cheniere marketing assigned its tua with sabine pass lng for bcf d of regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal to cheniere investments  effective july  concurrently  cheniere marketing was contracted by cheniere investments to monetize the lng storage and regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal on its behalf in exchange for compensation based upon the profitability of each transaction undertaken by cheniere marketing 
the following diagram depicts our abridged organizational structure after the tua assignment 
chenierecorpstructure 
jpg 
pursuant to cheniere marketing assignment of its tua to cheniere investments  cheniere marketing will no longer make the approximately million per year of payments to sabine pass lng  and cheniere partners will not make distributions on our subordinated units unless it generates additional cash flow for sabine pass lng excess capacity or new business 
therefore  distributions to us on our subordinated units and conversion of the subordinated units into common units will depend upon the future business development of cheniere partners 
concurrently with the tua assignment  cheniere investments entered into the vcra with cheniere marketing 
under the terms of the vcra  cheniere marketing will be responsible for monetizing cheniere investments tua capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal and is obligated to pay cheniere investments of the expected gross margin of each cargo of lng it arranges for delivery to the sabine pass lng terminal 
to the extent payments from cheniere marketing to cheniere investments under the vcra or new cheniere partners business increase cheniere partners available cash in excess of the common unit and general partner distributions and certain reserves  the cash would be distributed to us in the form of distributions on our subordinated units and related general partner distributions 
during the term of the vcra  cheniere marketing is responsible for the payment of taxes and new regulatory costs under the tua 
cheniere has guaranteed all of cheniere marketing payment obligations under the vcra 
in january  cheniere partners initiated an at the market program to sell up to million common units the proceeds from which would be used primarily to fund development costs associated with the liquefaction project 
sabine pass lng terminal approximately bcf d of regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal has been reserved under two long term third party tuas  under which sabine pass lng s customers are required to pay fi xed monthly fees  whether or not they use the lng terminal 
capacity reservation fee tua payments are made by our third party tua customers as follows total gas and power north america  inc total has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years tha t commenced april  total  sa has guaranteed total s obligations under its tua up to billion  subject to certain exceptions  and chevron usa  inc chevron has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years that commenced july  chevron corporation has guaranteed chevron s obligations under its tua up to of the fees payable by chev ron 
the remaining approximately bcf d of regasification capacity has been reserved by cheniere partners through a tua between cheniere investments and sabine pass lng 
cheniere investments is required to make approximately million per year of capacity payments to sabine pass lng through at least september   however  the revenue earned by sabine pass lng and the capacity payments under the tua is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
under each of these tuas  sabine pass lng is entitled to retain of the lng delivered for the customer account 
liquefaction project in june  cheniere partners initiated a project to add liquefaction services at the sabine pass lng terminal that would transform the terminal into a bi directional facility capable of liquefying natural gas and exporting lng in addition to importing and regasifying foreign sourced ln g 
as currently contemplated  the liquefaction project would be designed and permitted for up to four lng trains  each with a nominal production capacity of approximately mtpa 
we anticipate lng export from the sabine pass lng terminal could commence as early as  and may be constructed in phases  with each lng train commencing operations approximately six to nine months after the previous lng train 
we intend for sabine pass liquefaction  llc sabine liquefaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of cheniere partners  to enter into long term  fixed fee contracts for at least mtpa approximately bcf d of bi directional lng processing capacity per lng train  for a fee between and per mmbtu  before reaching a final investment decision regarding the development of the lng trains 
as of february   sabine liquefaction had entered into eight non binding memoranda of understanding mou with potential customers for the proposed bi directional facility representing a total of up to mtpa of capacity 
each mou is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and certain other customary conditions and does not represent a final and binding agreement with respect to its subject matter 
we are negotiating definitive agreements with these and other potential customers 
in august  sabine liquefaction received approval from the ferc to begin the pre filing process required to seek authorization to commence construction of the liquefacti on project 
in january  the pre filing period was completed and therefore sabine liquefaction submitted an application to the ferc requesting authorization to site  construct and operate liquefaction and export facilities at the sabine pass lng terminal 
in september  the doe granted sabine liquefaction an order authorizing sabine liquefaction to export up to mtpa approximately bcf per year of domestically produced lng from the sabine pass lng terminal to free trade agreement fta countries for a year term  beginning on the earlier of the date of first export or september  in september  sabine liquefaction filed a second application requesting expansion of the order to include countries with which the us does not have an fta 
sabine liquefaction has engaged bechtel to complete front end engineering and design work and to negotiate a lump sum  turnkey contract based on an open book cost estimate 
we currently estimate that total construction costs will be consistent with other recent liquefaction expansion projects constructed by bechtel  or approximately per metric ton  before financing costs 
we have additional work to complete with bechtel to be able to make an estimate specific to our site and project 
our cost estimates are subject to change due to factors such as changes in design  increased component and material costs  escalation of labor costs  cost overruns and increased spending to maintain a construction schedule 
in december  sabine liquefaction engaged sg americas securities  llc  the us broker dealer subsidiary of societe generale corporate investment banking sg cib for general financial strategy and planning in connection with the development and financing of liquefaction facilities at the sabine pass lng terminal 
cheniere partners will contemplate making a final investment decision to commence construction of the liquefaction project upon  among other things  entering into acceptable commercial arrangements  receiving regulatory authorization to construct and operate the liquefaction assets and obtaining adequate financing 
other lng terminals as discussed above  in may  we sold our limited partnership interest in freeport lng 
however  prior to the sale  freeport lng made aggregate distributions to us of million since inception 
we will contemplate making final investment decisions to construct our corpus christi and creole trail lng terminal projects upon  among other things  entering into acceptable commercial and financing arrangements for the applicable project 
we do not expect to spend significant funds on these projects in the near term 
natural gas pipeline business the creole trail pipeline  consisting of miles of natural gas pipeline  is currently in service and operating 
we will contemplate making a final investment decision to construct the remaining miles of the creole trail pipeline  the corpus christi pipeline  the cheniere southern trail pipeline and the burgos hub project upon  among other things  receiving all required authorizations to construct and operate the applicable pipeline and storage facility in the case of the burgos hub project  to the extent not already obtained  and entering into acceptable commercial and financing arrangements for the applicable project 
we do n ot expect to spend significant funds on these projects in the near term 
lng and natural gas marketing business the accounting treatment for lng inventory differs from the treatment for derivative positions such that the economics of cheniere marketing activities are not transparent in the consolidated financial statements until all lng inventory is sold and all derivative positions are settled 
our lng inventory is recorded as an asset at cost and is subject to lower of cost or market lcm adjustments at the end of each reporting period 
the lcm adjustment market price is based on period end natural gas spot prices  and any gain or loss from an lcm adjustment is recorded in our earnings at the end of each period 
revenue and cost of goods sold are not recognized in our earnings until the lng is sold 
generally  our unrealized derivatives positions at the end of each period extend into the future to hedge the cash flow from future sales of our lng inventory or to take market positions and hedge exposure associated with lng and natural gas 
these positions are measured at fair value  and we record the gains and losses from the change in their fair value currently in earnings 
thus  earnings from changes in the fair value of our derivatives may not be offset by losses from lcm adjustments to our lng i nventory because the lcm adjustments that may be made to lng inventory are based on period end spot prices that are different from the time periods of the prices used to fair value our derivatives 
any losses from changes in the fair value of our derivatives will not be offset by gains until the lng is actually sold 
management evaluates the performance of its lng and natural gas marketing business activities differently than the measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our consolidated statement of operations 
management calculates an adjusted lng and natural gas revenue non gaap measure to assess the performance of the lng and natural gas marketing business activities during each period 
management believes that the presentation of the adjusted lng and natural gas revenue non gaap measure provides a meaningful indicator of the performance of our lng and natural gas marketing business activities during the stated period 
the table below shows the differences between the components of both the lng and natural gas marketing revenue gaap measure presented in our consolidated statement of operations and the adjusted lng and natural gas revenue non gaap measure in thousands for the year ended december  lng and natural gas marketing revenue gaap measure adjusted lng and natural gas marketing revenue non gaap measure difference physical lng and natural gas sales cost of lng nbsp  realized natural gas derivative gain other energy trading activities lng and natural gas revenue the cost of lng presented under gaap only takes into consideration the cost of lng that was sold during  using the weighted average cost method for lng inventory 
the cost of lng presented under non gaap measure represents the value of its lng invent ory based on published forward natural gas price curve prices corresponding to the future months when the lng was planned to be sold as of december  under the gaap measure  our lng and natural gas marketing revenue was million in  but only million was generated by marketing activities during the period 
therefore  we believe that the adjusted lng and natural gas marketing revenue non gaap measure is a meaningful indicator of performance of our lng and natural gas marketing business activities during a stated period 
lngco agreements in march  cheniere marketing entered into the lngco agreements with lngco  effective april   under which cheniere marketing has agreed to develop and maintain commercial and trading opportunities in the lng industry and present any such opportunities exclusively to lngco 
cheniere marketing also agreed to provide  or arrange for the provision of  all of the operations and administrative services required by lngco in connection with any lng cargoes purchased by lngco  including negotiating agreements and arranging for transporting  receiving  storing  hedging and regasifying lng cargoes 
cheniere marketing does not have the authority to contractually bind lngco under the lngco agreements 
in the event lngco declines to purchase an lng cargo presented to it by cheniere marketing under the lngco agreements  cheniere marketing may pursue the opportunity on its own behalf or present it to third parties 
the term of the lngco agreements is two years  however  either party may terminate without penalty at the end of one year 
in return for the services to be provided by cheniere marketing  lngco will pay a fixed fee to cheniere marketing and may pay additional fees depending upon the gross margins of each transaction and the aggregate gross margin earned during the term of the lngco agreements 
during  we recognized million of marketing and trading revenues from lngco 
as of december   cheniere marketing maximum exposure relating to lngco was million related to margin deposits that have been paid to lngco and fixed fee and gross margin revenue receivables earned as of december  a portion of this million represents our fixed fee receivable and is reported as accounts and interest receivable  and the remaining port ion is reported as other non current assets and is to be paid to cheniere marketing upon the completion or termination of the lngco agreements 
corporate and other activities we are required to maintain corporate general and administrative functions to serve our business activities described above 
we believe that we have sufficient cash  other working capital and cash generated from our operations to fund our operating expenses and other cash r equirements until at least the earliest date when principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness may be required 
the earliest date that principal payments will be required is may   the maturity date of the term loan 
sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes in thousands the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis  therefore  these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures  including accruals  that are referred to elsewhere in this report 
additional discussion of these items follows the table

in addition  in june  through an amendment of the loans  we moved million out of the tua reserve account into an unrestricted cash and cash equivalents account 
in  million of restricted cash and cash equivalents was used to pay for construction activities at the sabine pass lng terminal 
the decreased use of restricted cash and cash equivalents during primarily resulted from substantially completing construction of the sabine pass lng terminal during the third quarter of  and the decreased use in primarily resulted from completing construction of the initial sendout capacity of approximately bcf d and storage capacity of approximately bcf at the sabine pass lng terminal in september distribution from limited partnership investment in freeport lng in and  we received million and million of distributions from freeport lng  respectively 
in may  we sold our investment in freeport lng and  therefore  will not receive distributions in the future

in the second quarter of  we used million of the net proceeds from the sale of our limited partner interest in freeport lng to partially prepay the term loan 
in addition  as a result of the assignment of the cheniere marketing tua in the second quarter of  we used million to partially prepay the loans 
in the second quarter of  we used a combination of million cash and cash equivalents and million common shares to prepay million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior unsecured notes

during  we received million from borrowings under the loans and million  net of discount  from the additional issuance of the notes

advances under long term contracts  net of transfers to construction in process we have entered into certain contracts and purchase agreements related to the construction of the sabine pass lng terminal that require us to make payments to fund costs that will be incurred or equipment that will be received in the future 
advances made under long term contracts on purchase commitments are carried at face value and transferred to property  plant  and equipment as the costs are incurred or equipment is received 
the zero advances under long term contracts in and resulted from substantial completion of the construction of the sabine pass lng terminal in september during  the sabine pass lng terminal received equipment that it had previously advanced payment for under long term contracts

the net proceeds from the additional issuance of the notes were million 
the difference between the par value and the net proceeds is the debt discount  which will be amortized through the maturity of the notes 
effective as of january   we are required to record a debt discount on our convertible senior unsecured notes 
the unamortized discount will be amortized through the maturity of the convertible senior unsecured notes

we may redeem some or all of the notes on or before august   for cash equal to of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest if in the previous trading days the volume weighted average price of our common stock exceeds  subject to adjustment  for at least five consecutive trading days 
in the event of such redemption  we will make an additional payment equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments through august   discounted at the us treasury securities rate plus basis points 
the indenture governing the notes contains customary reporting requirements 
as discussed in 
note long term debt and long term debt related parties of our notes to consolidated financial statements  we adopted on january  an accounting standard that requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments to separately account for the liability component and the equity component represented by the embedded conversion option in a manner that will reflect that entity nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
the fair value of the embedded conversion option at t he date of issuance of the convertible senior unsecured notes was determined to be million and has been recorded as a debt discount to the convertible senior unsecured notes  with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid in capital 
at december   the unamortized debt discount to the convertible senior unsecured notes was million 
during the second quarter of  we reduced debt by exchanging million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior unsecured notes for a combination of million cash and cash equivalents and million shares of common stock  reducing our principal amount due in to million as of december  and as a result of the exchange  we recogni zed a gain of million that we have reported as gain on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the remaining principal amount of the convertible senior unsecured notes are convertible into million of our common shares

the outstanding principal amount was initially exchangeable for cheniere newly created series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share series b preferred stock  with voting rights limited to the equivalent of  shares of cheniere common stock 
the exchange ratio was one share of series b preferred stock for each  of outstanding borrowings  subject to adjustment 
the aggregate preferred stock was exchangeable into shares of cheniere common stock at a price of per share pursuant to a broadly syndicated offering 
no portion of any accrued interest was eligible for conversion into series b preferred stock 
additionally  as long as the loans were exchangeable for shares of series b preferred stock or shares of series b preferred stock remained outstanding  the holders of a majority of the loans and series b preferred stock  acting together  had the right to nominate two individuals to the company board of directors  and together with the board of directors  a third nominee  who would be an independent director 
in june  the loans were amended to permit all funds on deposit in the tua reserve account to be applied to the prepayment of the accrued interest on the loans outstanding under the loans  with any remainder to be applied to the prepayment of the principal balance of such loans 
as a result  million from the tua reserve account was used to prepay million of accrued interest and million of principal of the loans 
in december  the loans we re amended to eliminate the lenders put rights  allow for the early prepayment of the loans  allow cheniere to sell its cheniere partners common units held as collateral and use the proceeds to prepay the loans and release restrictions on prepayments of other indebtedness at cheniere as certain conditions are met 
in addition  of the lenders agreed to terminate their rights to convert the loans into series b preferred stock the non convertible lenders 
in addition  all of the lenders have also agreed to terminate their right to nominate or designate board members of cheniere and cheniere partners 
as part of the december amendments to the loans  cheniere issued an aggregate of million shares of cheniere common stock to the non convertible lenders 
scorpion capital partners  lp  the holder of the remaining of the loans  will continue to retain its right to convert into series b preferred stock as described above  representing approximately million shares of cheniere common stock as of december  as of december  and  we classified million and million  respectively  as part of long term debt related parties on our consolidated balance sheets because related parties then held these portions of this debt

inflation and changing prices during  and  inflation and changing commodity prices have had an impact on our oil and gas revenues but have not significantly impacted our results of operations 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process th at has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to apply the accounting rules to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  we endeavor to comply properly with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe that the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them 
accounting for lng activities generally  we begin capitalizing the costs of our lng terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria i regulatory approval has been received  ii financing for the project is available and iii management has committed to commence construction 
prior to meeting these criteria  most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work  costs of s ecuring necessary regulatory approvals  and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng terminals and related pipelines 
generally  costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land and lease option costs that are capitalized as property  plant and equipment and certain permits that are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
the costs of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once obtained 
if no lease is obtained  the costs are expensed 
we capitalize interest and other related debt costs during the construction period of our lng terminal 
upon commencement of operations  capitalized interest  as a component of the total cost  will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity reservation fees are recognized as revenue over th e term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred and amortized over a year period as a reduction of a customer s regasification capacity reservation fees payable under its tua 
the retained of lng delivered for each customer s account at the sabine pass lng terminal is recognized as revenue as sabine pass lng performs the services set forth in each customer s tua 
use of estimates the preparation of consol idated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
estimates used in the assessment of impairment of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are the most significant of our estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future cash flows of assets or business segments 
the accuracy of any cash flow estimate is a function of judgment used in determining the amount of cash flows generated 
as a result  cash flows may be different from the cash flows that we use to assess impairment of our assets 
management reviews its estimates of cash flows on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic and commodity price environment 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock  reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business segments or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance 
projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results 
in addition  if our analysis results in an impairment of our long lived assets  incl uding goodwill  we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
other items subject to estimates and assumptions include asset retirement obligations  valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets  valuations of derivative instruments  valuations of non cash compensation and collectability of accounts receivable and other assets 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined accurately  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
lng and natural gas marketing we have determined that our lng and natural gas marketing business activities are energy trading and risk management activities for trading purposes and have elected to present these activities on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 
marketing and trading revenues represent the margin earned on the purchase and transportation of lng purchases and subsequent sales of natural gas to third parties 
these energy trading and risk management activities include  but are not limited to purchase of lng and natural gas  transportation contracts  and derivatives 
below is a brief description of our accounting treatment of each type of energy trading and risk management activity and how we account for it purchase of lng and natural gas the purchase value of lng or natural gas inventory is recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet at the cost to acquire the product 
our inventory is subject to lcm adjustment each quarter 
recoveries of losses resulting from interim period lcm adjustments are made due to market price recoveries on the same inventory in the same fiscal year and are recognized as gains in later interim periods with such gains not exceeding previously recognized losses 
any adjustment to o ur inventory is recorded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statement of operations 
transportation contracts we enter into transportation contracts with respect to the transport of lng or natural gas to a specific location for storage or sale 
transportation costs that are incurred during the purchase of lng or natural gas are capitalized as part of the acquisition costs of the product 
transportation costs incurred to sell lng or natural gas are re corded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statement of operations 
derivatives we use derivative instruments from time to time to hedge the cash flow variability of our commodity trading activities 
we have disclosed certain information regarding these derivative positions  including the fair value of our derivative positions  in 
note financial instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we record changes in the fair value of our derivative positions in our lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statement of operations based on the value for which the derivative instrument could be exchanged between willing parties 
to date  all of our derivative positions fair value determinations have been made by management using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments 
we had no open financial derivative instruments at december  regulated natural gas pipelines our developing natural gas pipeline business is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc in accordance with the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of the economic effects of regulation can result in a regulated company recording as assets those costs that have been or are expected to be approved for recovery from customers  or recording as liabilities those amounts that are expected to be required to be returned to customers  in a rate setting process in a period different from the period in which the amounts would be recorded by an unregulated enterprise 
accordi ngly  we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated rate making process that may not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
we continually assess whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities 
based on this continual assessment  we believe the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
these regulatory assets and liabilities are primarily classified in the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities 
we periodically evaluate their applicability under gaap  and consider factors such as regulatory changes and the effect of competition 
if cost based regulation ends or competition increases  we may have to reduce our asset balances to reflect a market basis less than cost and write off the associated regulatory assets and liabilities 
items that may influence our assessment are inability to recover cost increases due to rate caps and rate case moratoriums  inability to recover capitalized costs  including an adequate return on those costs through the rate making process and the f erc proceedings  excess capacity  increased competition and discounting in the markets we serve  and impacts of ongoing regulatory initiatives in the natural gas industry 
natural gas pipeline costs include amounts capitalized as an allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
the rates used in the calculation of afudc are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the ferc 
afudc represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance our natural gas pipeline additions during construction 
afudc is capitalized as a part of the cost of our natural gas pipelines 
under regulatory rate practices  we generally are permitted to recover afudc  and a fair return thereon  through our rate base after our natural gas pipelines are placed in service 
cash flow hedges we have used  and may in the future use  derivative instruments to limit our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
cash flow hedge transactions hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
in the case of cash flow hedges  the hedged item the underlying risk is generally unrecognized ie  not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet prior to settlement  and any changes in the fair value  therefore  will not be recorded within earnings 
conceptually  if a cash flow hedge is effective  this means that a variable  such as a movement in interest rates  has been effectively fixed so that any fluctuations will have no net result on either cash flows or earnings 
therefore  if the changes in fair value of the hedged item are not recorded in earnings  then the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument the derivative must also be excluded from th e income statement or else a one sided net impact on earnings will be reported  despite the fact that the establishment of the effective hedge results in no net economic impact 
to prevent such a scenario from occurring  gaap requires that the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge to be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  but with the offset reported as part of other comprehensive income  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
we assess  both at the inception of each hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
on an on going basis  we monitor the actual dollar offset of the hedges market values compared to hypothetical cash flow hedges 
any ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges will be reflected in earnings 
ineffectiveness is the amount of gains or losses from derivative instruments that are not offset by corr esponding and opposite gains or losses on the expected future transaction 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses acquired 
it is evaluated annually for impairment by first comparing our management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied f air value of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
we had goodwill of approximately million at december  and  attributable to our lng terminal segment 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year  although we may perform a goodwill impairment review more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recove rable 
as discussed above regarding our use of estimates  our judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management s estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit s fair value 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense we recognize our s hare based payments to employees in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant 
the calculated fair value is recognized as expense net of any capitalization over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that implied volatility  calculated based on traded options of our common stock  combined with historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends 
therefore  the expected volatility for the year ended december  used in our fair value model was based on a combination of implied and historical volatilities 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimat es involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  future share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see 
note share based compensation of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this guidance affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities 
the guidance is effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after november   for interim periods within the first annual reporting period and thereafter 
our adop tion of this authoritative guidance had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires additional disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  however  none of the specific additional disclosure requirements were applicable to us at the time of filing this report 
see 
note financial instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for our fair value measurement disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to address diversity in practice in the application of goodwill impairment testing by entities with reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  eliminating an entity s ability to assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform additional analysis because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 
this amendment is effective for fisc al years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investments we have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital 
such cash investments are stated at historical cost  which approximates fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet 
marketing and trading commodity price risk through cheniere marketing  from time to time we enter into natural gas and foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure of future cash flows associated with the lng that we hold 
we use value at risk var and other methodologies for market risk measurement and control purposes 
the var is calculated using the monte carlo simulation method 
at december  and  the one day var with a confidence interval on our derivative positions was zero and less than million  respectively 
we had not entered into any natural gas or foreign currency derivative positions as of december
