item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is an overview of the important factors that management focuses on in evaluating our business  financial condition and operating performance and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of any number of factors  including those set forth under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our business through our subsidiaries and commercial and contractual relationships and arrangements with other chinese companies  we operate companies in china that develop  manufacture and distribute high quality metal valves for a variety of different industries 
we are located in kaifeng  henan province and do business throughout china  southeast asia  the middle east and europe 
we produce over models of valves and service numerous industries  including the thermal power  water supply  municipal construction  sewage disposal  oil and chemical  metallurgy  heat power  and nuclear power industries 
we are the leader in valve sales for the thermal power  water supply industries  oil and chemical  and valve lock in china 
principal factors affecting our financial performance we believe that the following factors affect our financial performance growth of china s urbanization and industrialization the annual growth rate of the valve production industry in china is expected to be for the next few years 
this growth is fueled by rapid industrialization and manufacturing industries developing in china 
if this growth continues  we believe that the growth rate of the valve production industry will grow at a similar rate and that the company will be able to sustain its growth and continue to be a leader in the valve production industry in china 
prc regulations china has looked favorably on the valve production industry and has loosened regulations to promote manufacturing growth in china  which ultimately benefits china valves and similarly situated companies 
for example  in june  the state department of china issued a new policy called expedite the development of china s equipment manufacturing industry 
in this policy  the chinese government committed to promote the development of china s equipment manufacturing industry  which includes the valve industry  through  among other things  tax incentives  import export support and capital support 
in addition  the stimulus package offered by the chinese government will provide market opportunities for us 
as long as china continues to promote economic growth and allow manufacturing companies to grow and expand their operations  china valves expects its operations will be positively affected by prc regulations 
recent development registered direct on january   we conducted a registered direct offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of approximately million  to several accredited institutional investors 
in addition  we issued to the investors warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  in the aggregate  at a price of per share  exercisable for days beginning on the date of the initial issuance of the warrants 
the proceeds of the financing have or will be used for working capital 
taxation united states we are subject to united states tax at a tax rate of 
no provision for us federal income taxes has been made as we had no taxable income in the united states for and hong kong our subsidiaries  china fluid and hong kong hanxi are incorporated in hong kong 
the subsidiaries did not earn any income that was derived in hong kong for the years ended december  and and therefore was not subject to hong kong profit tax 
the payments of dividends by hong kong companies are not subject to any hong kong withholding tax 
prc we conduct all our operating business through its operating subsidiaries in china 
the operating subsidiaries are governed by the income tax laws of the prc  the company does not have any deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities because there are no temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
substantially all of our income may be derived from dividends we receive from our prc operating subsidiaries described above 
the new eit law and its implementing rules generally provide that a withholding tax applies to china sourced income derived by non resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes 
we expect that such withholding tax will apply to dividends paid to us by our prc subsidiaries but this treatment will depend on our status as a non resident enterprise 
for detailed discussion of prc tax issues related to resident enterprise status  see risk factors risks associated with doing business in china 
under the new eit law  china valves technology inc and its subsidiaries china fluid equipment and henan tonghai fluid may be classified as a resident enterprise of china 
such a classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc stockholders 
our operating subsidiaries are classified as resident enterprises under the eit law 
beginning in january  both kaifeng valve and zd valve became subject to an income tax at an effective rate of under the eit law 
the new acquired operating company  taide valve  and yangzhou valve is also subject to an income tax rate of 
changsha valve is subject to an income tax at a reduced rate of in  which is the last year of tax benefit period before subjecting to a full tax rate 
hanwei valve as a high technology enterprise is subject to an income tax at rate of until the local tax authorities will do a special taxation review regarding its development of high technology at the end of if the review is positive  hanwei valve will be subject to of income tax rate for another three years until another three year taxation review in we incurred income taxes of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from the taxes we incurred in the same period 
penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred 
no significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes have been incurred during the years ended december  and results of operations the following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  in dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  sales revenue   cost of sales   gross profit   expenses general administrative expenses   research and development costs   selling expenses   non cash stock compensation expense   total operating expenses   income from operations   change in fair value of derivative instruments  gain from acquisition  other income  net   interest and finance expense  net   total other income expense  net   income before income taxes   income taxes   net income   foreign currency translation gain loss   comprehensive income   as a percentage of sales revenue sales revenue cost of sales gross profit expenses general administrative expenses research and development costs selling expenses non cash stock compensation expense total operating expenses income before income taxes income taxes net income the following tables set forth our sales by valve types  in terms of sales revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  sales revenue in thousands gate valves   check valves   globe valves   safety valves   butterfly valves   ball valves   vent valves other   total sales revenue   the china valve industry association divides the valve market into five primary segments i power  ii petrochemical and oil  iii water supply  iv metallurgy  and v other areas 
our revenues in these markets are as follows year ended december  in thousands power supply   petrochemical and oil   water supply   metallurgy   other   total sales revenue   year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales revenue 
sales revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of this increase resulted from recently acquired subsidiaries  yangzhou valve  changsha valve and hanwei valve  which contributed million to our sales revenue 
adjusting for the effect of changes in exchange rates  our sales revenue increased by 
the increase was also attributable to increased demand for our products fueled by rapid industrialization and governmental capital expenditure on china s infrastructure 
in addition  our innovations on high temperature high pressure power station gate valves and two way metal sealing butterfly valves  which are popular among our customers  also contributed to sales volume increases as compared to sales in the same period last year 
we also made efforts to expand sales in the petrochemical  oil and nuclear areas  while strengthening the current thermal power and hydro power market for our products 
our success in adding new types of valves  such as large diameter high pressure valves used in power stations  valves for nuclear power plants  and other large governmental water pipe projects requiring supplies of meter and up diameter valves also helped fuel demand for our products and contributed to the sales increase 
our sales from organic growth accounted for of total sales growth while sales from our newly acquired companies accounted for of total sales growth 
in  revenues from butterfly valves  gate valves and ball valves constituted of our total revenues for the period 
revenue from butterfly valves for amounted to million which is million or more than revenue for the same period ended on december  this increase is mainly attributable to the newly acquired subsidiary changsha valve whose key product is butterfly valve 
it is also due to the fact that we are the sole manufacturer and distributor for the integrated two way metal sealed butterfly valves used to control municipal water and sewage flow 
these new generation butterfly valves have achieved around market share in the largest ten cities in china 
revenue from gate valves for amounted to million which is million or more than that of these increases were attributable to the large increase in power station construction projects in china 
by the end of  the company had developed the capability to manufacture high quality technology intensive forged steel valves for use in ultra supercritical thermal power generators in  mw power stations 
the company is the sole designer and manufacturer in china for this type of valve  which can replace the imported valves used in the thermal power industry 
the newly developed  high margin valves perform as well as the similar advanced overseas products and resulted in a large amount of orders in the other factor in the sales increase in was the continued extensive use of gate valves in the petro chemical and nuclear power industries 
revenue from ball valves for amounted to million  which is million or more than that for this increase was attributable to the recently acquired subsidiary hanwei valve 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the costs of our raw materials such as steel castings  components  labor and overhead 
our cost of sales increased million  or to million in from million in the cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenue  increased from in to in the increase was in line with the increase in sales revenues and was also attributable to from higher labor and management costs of those newly acquired entities 
the increase in cost of raw materials also contributed to an increase in cost of sales 
gross profit 
our gross profit is equal to the difference between our sales revenue and our cost of sales 
our gross profit increased million  or to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales revenue decreased to from for the same period in the decrease in gross profit percentage was because the three recently acquired subsidiaries had lower overall gross profit percentage as the products sold by these subsidiaries during the period  such as gate valves and ball valves  had lower gross profit than that of the butterfly valves and high pressure valves sold by zd valve and kaifeng valve 
in addition  the higher labor and management costs of the new subsidiaries resulted in higher fixed costs per unit and lower overall gross profit percentage 
furthermore  in the company sold more medium to low pressure valves  which generally have lower selling prices  which also contributed to the decrease in gross profit percentage 
the company is currently standardizing production methodology and techniques at the new subsidiaries in order to optimize the new subsidiaries production capacity 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of related salaries and benefits  business development  travelling expenses  and legal and professional expenses  were million for  compared with million for  an increase of million or approximately 
the increase is primarily due to increase in salary expense for the newly acquired subsidiaries  as well as the hire of more educated entry level administrative and technologic personnel 
professional fees  travel expense and meal and entertainment expenses also increased due to various business acquisition activities 
depreciation expense increased as result of increased fixed asset purchases 
general and administrative expenses as percentage of total revenue is in as compared to in the increase is primarily due to the increased expenses added by the recently acquired subsidiaries 
selling expenses 
selling expenses  which consist primarily of sales commission  advertising and promotion expenses  sales tax  freight charges and related compensation  were million for  compared with million for  an increase of million or  which was in line with the sales revenue increase 
however  the implementation of the strengthened cost control policy and the setup of headquarter of sales and marketing in shanghai resulted in significantly improved marketing activities and brought in more large sales contracts with relatively lower sales and marketing expenses in the percentage of sales and marketing expenses as percentage of sales was  compared to in total operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  which was in line with the sales revenue increase and mainly attributable to newly acquired subsidiaries 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes increased million  or  to million in from million in income before income taxes as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in as result of increase in sales revenue and a lower effective income tax rate in foreign currency translation gains we had a foreign currency translation gain of million in as compared with a million currency translation loss in in july  china reformed its foreign currency exchange policy and allowed the renminbi to fluctuate as much as percent per day against the us dollar 
we use period end exchange rates in translating our assets and liabilities denominated in renminbi into us dollars and average exchange rates for the period to translate our income and expenses 
at december   the period end exchange rate was rmb to us and the average exchange rate for was rmb to us 
at december   the period end exchange rate was rmb to us and the average exchange rate for was rmb to us 
rmb appreciated approximately in in terms of the period end exchange rate of compared with that of our sales revenue increased by rmb million or compared with the same period in and our operating expenses increased by rmb million or compared with the same period in as the renminbi appreciated against the us dollar during the period  our reported sales revenues and operating expenses were affected  increasing and  respectively  in us dollar terms  as follows year ended december  in million change us average rate rmb us average rate rmb us rmb us rmb revenue  total operating expenses allowance for doubtful debts our trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts were million as of december   an increase of million  or  from million as of december  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  as of december   compared with  at december  the increase in our trade receivables was mainly due to recently acquired subsidiaries 
generally we consider a trade receivable as a doubtful account if it remains uncollected for more than one year from the due date or as specific events occurred to our customers which may require us to reserve allowance even if trade balance is below one year 
our allowance for doubtful debts accounts for an insignificant portion of the receivable balance in spite of the increasing trade receivable balance throughout the reporting periods because we have improved our account receivables collections 
many of our customers have long business relationships with us and good settlement histories 
in the absence of significant bad debt experience  we consider the existing provisioning policy as adequate 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
the following table provides summarized information about our net cash flow for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided used in by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided used in by financing activities   effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year   cash and cash equivalents  end of year   operating activities in the fiscal year ended december   our net cash flow provided by operating activities was million  a decrease of million from the net cash flow provided by operating activities of million for the same period in this is attributed to an increase of accounts receivables of million which offsets a strong increase of net profit of million compared with investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities are for acquisitions of other companies  which the three acquisitions were closed with cash paid by million in also we spend another million on the acquisition of plant and equipment as well as on building improvements 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  as compared with million in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
on january   we completed a registered direct offering of our common shares to certain accredited investors resulting in million in net proceeds 
our debt to equity ratio was as of december  as compared to as of december  we believe we have greatly improved our company s position by decreasing our borrowings 
we plan to maintain our debt to equity ratio at the ratio as of december  as of december   the maturities for our bank loans are all below one year 
we believe that we maintain good relationships with the banks we deal with and our current available working capital  after receiving the aggregate proceeds of the capital raising activities and bank loans  should be adequate to sustain our operations at our current levels through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures in and are set forth below 
our capital expenditures were used primarily for plant construction and purchases of equipment to expand our production capacity 
years ended december  in thousands construction costs  purchase of equipment   advance on equipment construction fee total capital expenditure   our depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and  and the income statement line items in which it is included  was as follows years ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold  general and administrative expenses   total depreciation and amortization expense   obligations under material contracts we did not have any long term debt obligations  capital commitments  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities as of december  business combinations on january   the company acquired the assets of yangzhou rock valve lock technology co  ltd 
for a total cash consideration of million 
yangzhou valve designs  manufactures and distributes interlock valves  valve block devices  magnetic valves  and mechanical interlocking machines 
in february  the company acquired all the equity interests in able delight changsha valve co  ltd  formerly an indirect subsidiary of watts water technologies  inc watts  for a purchase price of million plus certain assumed obligations and acquisition expenses of million  or an aggregate expenditure of approximately million 
changsha valve was purchased from able delight investment  ltd  which had acquired changsha valve from watts in january with million from funds loaned to it by the company 
the company directly paid the balance of million to other parties as disclosed in ka released on november  able delight investment  ltd 
had been formed in november by qing lu  the wife of bin li  a stockholder of the company  in order to facilitate the company s purchase of changsha valve 
the company s purchase price included the discharge of the loan  payments to certain of watt s subsidiaries  and certain other financial obligations of changsha valve 
changsha valve is a manufacturer of butterfly and other valves used by hydro  thermal and nuclear power plants and in water and sewage treatment applications 
on april   the company acquired from certain unaffiliated individuals the two entities that were owners of the joint venture that in turn owned shanghai pudong hanwei valve co  ltd 
hanwei valve  together with certain intangible assets used in the operation of hanwei valve  for an aggregate of million 
hanwei valve is a manufacturer of various valve products and the sole producer in china of the fully welded ball valve used in long distance gas pipelines and the way rotary valve used in the petrochemical industry 
the acquisitions of yangzhou valve  changsha valve and hanwei valve contributed  in the aggregate  million to the company s sales revenues  representing of such revenues  and contributed significantly to the company s increase in net income for critical accounting policies our consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal period and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each fiscal period 
we continually evaluate these estimates based on our own historical experience  knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions  our expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions  which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application 
when reviewing our financial statements  the following should also be considered our selection of critical accounting policies  the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles regarding revenue recognition 
sales revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv the ability to collect is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally satisfied at the time of delivery for domestic sales when risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
for international sales  the revenue recognition criteria are generally satisfied under free on board fob terms  in which the company s responsibility ends once the goods clear the port of shipment 
the company recognizes revenue when the goods are delivered and title has passed 
sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods  net of a value added tax vat 
all of the company s products that are sold in the prc are subject to a chinese value added tax at a rate of of the gross sales price or at a rate approved by the chinese local government 
this vat may be offset by the vat paid by the company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing their finished product 
the company allows its customers to retain to of the contract prices as retainage during the warranty period  usually or months  to guarantee product quality 
historically  the company has experienced insignificant warranty claims resulting in the company having to repair or exchange a defective product 
due to the infrequency and insignificant amount of warranty claims  the ability to collect retainage is reasonably assured and is recognized at the time of shipment 
the company also provides services to some of its sales agents and distributors 
the company recognizes revenue on these services once a contract is signed and the services have been rendered 
foreign currency translation and other comprehensive income the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our chinese operating entities kaifeng valve  zd valve  taizhou taide valve  yangzhou valve  changsha valve and hanwei valve is the renminbi rmb 
for the subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the us dollar  all assets and liabilities accounts were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date  shareholders equity is translated at the historical rates and items in the income and cash flow statements are translated at the average rate for the year 
because cash flows are calculated based using the average translation rate  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity 
the resulting translation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity amounted to  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity at december  and were translated at rmb and rmb to usd  respectively 
the average translation rates applied to income and cash flow statement amounts for the year ended december  and were rmb and rmb to  respectively 
income taxes the company applies the accounting standard regarding accounting for income taxes and the accounting standard regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for income taxes 
this accounting standard requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities 
provision for income taxes consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes 
the charge for taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non assessable or disallowed 
it is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
deferred taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit 
in principle  deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences  and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized 
under the accounting standard regarding  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred 
no significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes have been incurred during the years ended december  and gaap also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
warranties we typically warranty all of our products 
it is the company s policy to replace parts if they become defective within one year after deployment at no additional charge 
historically  failure of product parts due to materials or workmanship is rare 
therefore  at december  and december   the company made no provision for warranty claims for our products 
management continuously evaluates the potential warranty obligation 
management will record the expenses related to the warranty obligation if the estimated amount becomes material at the time revenue is recorded 
concentration risks the company operations are carried out in the prc 
accordingly  the company business  financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political  economic and legal environment in the prc  and by the general state of the prc economy 
the company operations in the prc are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in north america and western europe 
the company results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations  anti inflationary measures  currency conversion and remittance abroad  and rates and methods of taxation  among other things 
certain financial instruments may subject the company to concentration of credit risk 
the company maintains bank deposits within state owned banks within the prc  hong kong and united states 
balances at financial institutions of state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance 
as of december  and  the company s cash and restricted cash balances  totaling  and  respectively at those dates  were not covered by insurance 
the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts 
five suppliers represented approximately and of the company s total purchases for the years ended december  and  respectively 
five customers accounted for and of total sales as of december  and respectively 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s business operations are conducted in the prc 
during the normal course of business  the company extends unsecured credit to its customers by selling on various credit terms 
management reviews its accounts receivable on a quarterly basis to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 
an estimate for doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable 
the company s existing reserve is consistent with its historical experience and considered adequate by the management 
fair value of financial instruments the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements on january  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures 
the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and payables qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest 
the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instruments 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value 
the company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the accounting standards regarding accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and the accounting standard regarding determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the accounting standard specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
this standard provides a two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for this accounting standard scope exception 
all warrants issued by the company are denominated in usd  because the company s functional currency is the rmb  the company accounts for these warrants as derivative instrument liabilities and marks them to market each period 
because there is no quoted or observable market price for the warrants  the company used level inputs for its valuation methodology 
the company invested in china perfect machinery industry co  ltd 
in and kaifang commercial bank in these long term investments are carried at the lower of cost or market value and amounted to  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
there is no quoted or observable market price for these investments  therefore  the company used level inputs for its valuation methodology 
based on its proportionate share of the underlying book value of the investees  the company believes the fair value of the investments is at least equal to the original cost 
the determination of the fair value was based on the capital investment that the company contributed 
there has been no change in the carrying value since inception  other than the effects of translating the balances to us dollars 
long lived assets long lived assets  including buildings and improvements  equipment and intangible assets are reviewed if events and changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable  to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired 
the company considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations 
the company also re evaluates the periods of depreciation and amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
for the year ended december   the company impaired long lived assets in the amount of  which were included in cost of goods sold 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is instead tested for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
the company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill every year at december and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests 
no impairment loss was recorded for the year ended december  stock based compensation the company applies statement of financial accounting standards on accounting for stock based compensation  which defines a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and transactions in which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from non employees 
stock compensation for stock granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with the standard and the accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services standard  as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
the standard allows the simplified method to determine the term of employee options when other information is not available 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  fasb issued asu no 
regarding accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary 
under this guidance  an entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary  and entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value 
in contrast  an entity is required to account for a decrease in its ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction 
this asu clarifies the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions  and expands the disclosures about the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or de recognition of a group of assets 
this asu is effective for beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements in january  fasb issued asu no 
accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification 
the amendments in this update affect accounting and reporting by an entity that experiences a decrease in ownership in a subsidiary that is a business or nonprofit activity 
the amendments also affect accounting and reporting by an entity that exchanges a group of assets that constitutes a business or nonprofit activity for an equity interest in another entity 
the amendments in this update are effective beginning in the period that an entity adopts sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
if an entity has previously adopted sfas no 
as of the date the amendments in this update are included in the accounting standards codification  the amendments in this update are effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to the first period that an entity adopted sfas no 
the company adopted this standard and the adoption of this standard did not have material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb issued asu no 
improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that requires new disclosure as follows transfers in and out of levels and a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
activity in level fair value measurements 
in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that clarify existing disclosures as follows level of disaggregation 
a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities 
disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this asu 
however  the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
