item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the readers of our financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business 
the md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we are reporting a  increase in net sales and a  increase in operating income for fiscal from fiscal our net income increased to  or per diluted share  an increase of  or compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  working capital of  and shareholders equity of  our business is separated into three principal segments health sciences  specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products 
the health sciences segment is our largest segment in terms of both sales and gross profits 
products that fall within this segment include pharmaceutical intermediates  apis  finished dosage form generic drugs and nutraceutical products 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we believe we have a pipeline of new apis poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and in europe 
in addition  we continue to explore opportunities to provide a second source option for existing generic drugs with approved abbreviated new drug applications andas 
the opportunities that we are looking for are to supply the apis for the more mature generic drugs where pricing has stabilized following the dramatic decreases in price that these drugs experienced after coming off patent 
as is the case in the generic industry  the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the pricing of the affected products 
by leveraging our worldwide sourcing  quality assurance and regulatory capabilities  we believe we can be an alternative economical  second source provider of existing apis to generic drug companies 
on december   we acquired certain assets of rising 
we believe that the acquisition of rising will establish another platform for our growth in our health sciences business by the expansion of our finished dosage form product offerings from both foreign and domestic facilities as well as complementing our core strength of sourcing active pharmaceutical ingredients 
the addition of rising provides aceto with a presence as a developer and marketer of our own brand of generic pharmaceuticals  the rising brand 
aceto supplies the raw materials used in the production of nutritional and packaged dietary supplements  including vitamins  amino acids  iron compounds and biochemicals used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations 
aceto s identification of a change in the attitudes of europeans towards nutritional products led to the decision to globalize this business and create an operating company to focus on it  aceto health ingredients gmbh  headquartered in germany 
this globally structured business has become the model for all of our business segments  providing international reach and perspective for our customers 
the specialty chemicals segment is a supplier to the many different industries that require outstanding performance from chemical raw materials and additives 
specialty chemicals include a variety of chemicals which make plastics  surface coatings  textiles  fuels and lubricants perform to their designed capabilities 
dye and pigment intermediates are used in the color producing industries such as textiles  inks  paper  and coatings 
many of our raw materials are also used in high tech products like high end electronic parts circuit boards and computer chips and binders for specialized rocket fuels 
we continue to respond to the changing needs of our customers in the color producing industry by taking our resources and knowledge downstream as a supplier of select organic pigments 
in addition  aceto is a leader in the supply of diazos and couplers to the paper  film and electronics industries 
the agricultural protection products segment sells herbicides  fungicides  insecticides  and other agricultural chemicals to customers  primarily located in the united states and western europe 
we began selling glyphosate  the largest selling herbicide for both crop and non crop use sold in the united states  in the third quarter of fiscal however  our entry into this market has proven to be much more challenging than had been expected 
our future participation will likely only be on an opportunistic basis when our asian sourcing offers us an opportunity to be profitable and competitive in the us domestic market 
strategically  this is not a product or business activity that we have factored into our business plans going forward 
in fiscal  we began selling three new agricultural protection products 
our current pipeline in the agricultural protection area consists of two products which we have filed with the epa for registrations  one of which we hope to start selling for the growing season 
in addition  there is one other product that we plan on filing for registration with the epa in the near future 
our plan is to continue to develop this pipeline and bring to market additional products in a similar manner 
we believe our main business strengths are sourcing  regulatory support  quality assurance and marketing and distribution 
with business operations in ten countries  we distribute more than  chemical compounds used principally as finished products or raw materials in the pharmaceutical  nutraceutical  agricultural  coatings and industrial chemical consuming industries 
we believe that we are currently one of the largest merchant buyers of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different manufacturers 
in this md a  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including  among other things  the following factors that affect our business our earnings and costs in the periods presented changes in earnings and costs between periods sources of earnings the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this md a  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  inventories  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  long lived assets  environmental and other contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives include volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates based on the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate 
in addition  upon each sale  estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns  government reimbursed rebates  and other adjustments are made 
these estimates are recorded as reductions to gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to either accounts receivable reserves or reserve for price concessions 
we have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
royalty income we have royalty agreements on certain products where third party pharmaceutical companies market such products 
we earn and collect royalty income based on percentages of net profits as defined in those agreements 
partnered products we have various products which we have entered into collaborative arrangements with certain pharmaceutical companies 
as a result of these arrangements  we share profits on sales of these products  which are included in cost of sales 
the shared profits are settled on a quarterly basis 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
in accordance with gaap  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and appropriate market participant assumptions that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
if our estimates or our related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long lived assets in accordance with gaap  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  product rights and related intangibles  epa registrations and related data  patent license  and technology based intangibles 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with gaap 
gaap establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset could result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided for on the majority of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability is recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
in connection with the rising acquisition  the company repatriated approximately  of cash from certain foreign subsidiaries  resulting in a tax charge of approximately  recorded during the year ended june  the company intends to permanently reinvest any undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability on undistributed earnings is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability 
stock based compensation in accordance with gaap  we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeiture rates 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and dividend yield 
the company uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is a combination of both historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of its common stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on aceto s common stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the company believes that the historical volatility of the price of its common stock over the expected life of the option is a reasonable indicator of the expected future volatility and that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility might differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  the company believes a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of its common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change health sciences specialty chemicals agricultural protection net sales gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change health sciences specialty chemicals agricultural protection gross profit net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in all three of our business segments 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
overall  the domestic health sciences group had an increase of  when compared to the prior year 
on december   we acquired certain assets of rising  a new jersey based company that markets and distributes generic prescription and over the counter pharmaceutical products to leading wholesalers  chain drug stores  distributors  mass market merchandisers and others under its own label  throughout the united states 
we experienced sales of these products of  where there was no comparable amount in the prior year 
this increase is offset in part by a decline of approximately  in sales of pharmaceutical intermediates  which represent key components used in the manufacture of certain drug products 
in addition  the health sciences segment saw an increase in sales from our international operations of  over the prior year  particularly in europe 
specialty chemicals net sales for the specialty chemicals segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year  representing a  or increase 
our chemical business consists of a variety of products  customers and consuming markets  most of which is affected by current economic conditions 
as previously mentioned  the index for consumer durables  which impacts the specialty chemicals segment  had risen at an annual rate of 
sales of our chemicals used in surface coatings increased  from the prior year  as well as sales of agricultural  dye  pigment and miscellaneous intermediates which together increased  in addition  sales of our polymer additives increased  from the prior year  as well as a rise in sales of dyes of  from the prior year 
these four increases represent increased demand in sectors that are affected by general economic conditions 
in march  we acquired certain assets of andrews paper chemical  co  inc  a supplier of diazos and couplers to the paper  film  and electronics industries 
since there was only four months of sales in the prior year versus a full year in  we experienced a sales increase of these products of  in addition  we experienced an increase in sales of specialty chemicals from our international operations of  primarily in france 
agricultural protection products net sales for the agricultural protection products segment increased to  for the year ended june   an increase of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the increase over the prior year is due to our introduction of glyphosate  which commenced sales in the third quarter of fiscal however  our entry into this market has proven to be much more challenging than had been expected 
our future participation will likely only be on an opportunistic basis when our asian sourcing offers us an opportunity to be profitable and competitive in the us domestic market 
strategically  this is not a product or business activity that we have factored into our business plans going forward 
the increase in agricultural protection products sales is also due in part to a new wide range insecticide that began selling in the third quarter of  which is used on various crops including cereals  citrus  cotton  grapes  ornamental grasses and vegetables and a new herbicide that also began selling in the third quarter of fiscal  which is used primarily on grass  to control broadleaf weeds and on some crops  flowers and shrubs 
in addition  the increase in sales of our agricultural protection products business is due to a rise in sales of asulam  a herbicide used on sugar cane 
gross profit gross profit increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june  increased  or  over the prior year 
the gross margin increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin in the health sciences segment primarily relates to rising  certain assets of which we acquired on december  in addition  gross profit increased due to increased sales volume in our international operations due predominantly to reorders of existing products 
specialty chemicals gross profit for the year ended june   increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the gross profit is due primarily to increased gross profit of  on sales of domestic specialty chemicals 
the decrease in gross margin primarily relates to a decline in margin on products sold by our international operations  due primarily to unfavorable product mix on certain specialty chemicals 
additionally  we have experienced price increases from some of our asian suppliers  primarily china  due to inflationary pressure 
most of these price increases have been passed onto our customers  but not all 
we expect this trend to continue in the short term 
agricultural protection products gross profit for the agricultural protection products segment was relatively consistent at  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year 
gross margin for the year ended june  was compared to the prior year gross margin of 
the decline in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the commencement of significant sales of our glyphosate product in the third quarter of fiscal  the gross margin on which was lower than expected due to the difficult and crowded market conditions surrounding this commodity type product 
we also recorded increased amortization expense related to product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for the year ended june  versus for the prior year 
on december   we acquired certain assets of rising  thus we now have six months of sg a for this subsidiary  including amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets 
we also incurred approximately  of transaction costs related to this acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal these increases are offset by approximately  of one time costs associated with the separation of our former chairman of the board of directors and ceo  which was recorded in the year ended june   as well as an overall decline in costs  resulting from the rationalization project we undertook in fiscal operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the overall increase in gross profit of  partially offset by an increase in sg a of  from the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended june   an increase of  from in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to interest expense on the bank loans that were incurred to partially finance the acquisition of certain assets of rising 
interest and other income  net interest and other income net was  for the year ended june   which represents an increase of over in the prior year mainly due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses and an increase in income related to a joint venture 
the joint venture income represents our investment in a corporate joint venture established for the purpose of selling a particular agricultural protection product 
our initial investment was in fiscal  representing a ownership and we account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an approximate  tax charge related to the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  in connection with our acquisition of rising 
the company intends to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change health sciences specialty chemicals agricultural protection net sales gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change health sciences specialty chemicals agricultural protection gross profit net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in the specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products segments and a sales decrease in the health sciences segment  as explained below 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment decreased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a decrease over net sales of  for the prior year 
this decrease is predominantly due to decreased sales from our foreign operations  specifically our asian and the netherlands operations  due primarily to weak demand from certain customers 
the decrease in health sciences sales is partially offset by a  increase in sales of nutraceutical products  sold both domestically and in germany and  increase in sales of our domestic generics product group 
the increase in sales of nutraceutical products  which represent raw materials used in the production of nutritional supplements  is due to increased penetration of existing products across the entire customer base  as well as new customers 
in addition  growth in vitamin sales and medical foods is attributed to increased sales efforts 
the increase in sales of our domestic generics product group is due to a rise in reorders of existing products 
specialty chemicals net sales for the specialty chemicals segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year  representing a  or increase 
our specialty chemicals business consists of a variety of products  customers and consuming markets  most of which is affected by current economic conditions 
as previously mentioned  the index for consumer durables  which impacts the specialty chemicals segment  expanded at an annual rate of  resulting in increased sales of this segment 
the increase in sales from this segment is attributable to increased sales of  in chemicals used to produce surface coatings and a  increase in sales of chemicals utilized in the food  beverage and cosmetic industries 
in addition  we experienced an increase in sales of specialty chemicals from our foreign operations of  agricultural protection products net sales for the agricultural protection products segment increased to  for the year ended june   an increase of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the increase over the prior year is due primarily to sales of glyphosate  which commenced in the third quarter of gross profit gross profit decreased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
in december  we completed a review of our inventory by product line and recorded an non cash inventory write down to its estimated net realizable value  included in cost of sales  relating to certain health sciences and specialty chemicals inventories 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june  decreased by  or  over the prior year 
the gross margin declined to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior period 
the decrease in gross profit was partially attributable to the overall decline in sales volume 
our foreign operations  specifically germany  experienced a drop in gross profit of  over the prior period due to the reduction of reorders of existing products that generally yield a more favorable gross margin 
specialty chemicals gross profit for the year ended june   increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in both gross profit and gross margin is due primarily to sales volume rise and favorable product mix  particularly in chemicals utilized to produce surface coatings and miscellaneous organic chemicals 
agricultural protection products gross profit for the agricultural protection products segment decreased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  a decrease of or 
gross margin for the year ended june  was compared to the prior year gross margin of 
the decrease in the gross profit and gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the commencement of significant sales of our glyphosate product in the third quarter of fiscal  the gross margin on which was lower than expected due to the difficult and crowded market conditions surrounding this commodity type product 
we also recorded increased amortization expense related to product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups and lower gross margin on certain sprout inhibitor products and an herbicide used on sugar cane 
these decreases are partially offset by the gross profit related to a herbicide used to control sedge on rice  vegetables and grasses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for the year ended june  versus for the prior year 
in the second quarter of fiscal  approximately  of one time costs associated with the separation of the company s former chairman of the board of directors and ceo  were recorded 
in addition  the company completed an sg a rationalization review and recorded charges of approximately  for personnel related costs in conjunction with its cost reduction efforts 
the increase in sg a is partially offset by a decline of  in personnel related costs due to decreased accrued bonus expense  decrease in fringe benefits and a decline in stock based compensation expense 
sg a also decreased due to a drop in sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  in the prior period  we had in research and development expenses r d with no comparable amount in fiscal due to the abandonment in fiscal of r d related to two finished dosage form generic pharmaceutical products that were to be distributed in europe 
operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to the overall decrease in gross profit of  and increase in sg a of from the prior year 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was for the year ended june   which was relatively consistent to the amount of that was in the prior year 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due to various factors including tax charges related to the reorganization of our shanghai operations and an increase in the expected mix of profits from higher tax rate jurisdictions in liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash  of which  was outside the united states  in short term investments and  in long term debt including the current portion 
the  of cash held outside of the united states is fully accessible to meet any liquidity needs of the countries in which aceto operates 
the majority of the cash located outside of the united states is held by our european operations and can be transferred into the united states 
although these amounts are fully accessible  transferring these amounts into the united states or any other countries could have certain tax consequences 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
the company intends to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
a portion of our cash is held in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
our cash position at june  decreased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to a use of cash of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income   derived from adjustments for non cash items and a net increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash items included  in depreciation and amortization expense   of earnings on an equity investment in a joint venture and in non cash stock compensation expense 
trade accounts receivable decreased  during the year ended june  due to an improvement in days sales outstanding 
inventories decreased by approximately  due primarily to the prior year in which the company made advance purchases of glyphosate  an agricultural protection product  for sales that occurred in the fiscal growing season 
this decrease in inventories is offset in part by purchases of domestic specialty chemicals  as a result of a ramp up in orders for products expected to be shipped in fiscal as well as overall improvement in consumer durables  which has a direct affect on the specialty chemicals business 
other receivables decreased  due primarily to a decrease in value added tax vat receivables in our european subsidiaries  primarily related to timing 
accounts payable increased by  due to timing of payments processed at the end of the year 
accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased  during the year ended june   due primarily to the decline in advance payments from customers and decrease in vat for our foreign subsidiaries  particularly germany 
our cash position at june  decreased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  used cash of  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income   derived from adjustments for non cash items and a net  decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash items included  in depreciation and amortization expense   in stock compensation  for the provision for doubtful accounts and an non cash inventory write down 
trade accounts receivable increased  during the year ended june  due to an increase in sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of inventories and accounts payable increased by approximately  and  respectively  due primarily to agricultural protection advance purchases of glyphosate  for sales that occurred in the fiscal growing season 
inventories and accounts payable have also increased related to purchases of domestic specialty chemicals  as a result of a ramp up in orders for products shipped in the first and second quarters of fiscal  as well as overall improvement in the economy during fiscal accrued expenses and other liabilities increased  during the year ended june   due primarily to advance payments from customers and an increase in value added tax vat for our foreign subsidiaries  particularly germany 
our cash position at june  increased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income   derived from adjustments for non cash items and a net  increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operations from to relates to a decrease in trade accounts receivable due to decreased sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  as well as a significant improvement in days sales outstanding 
this increase in cash provided by operations in is also the result of decreased inventories  partly offset by a reduction in accounts payable  due primarily to a reduction of inventories in both our domestic health sciences and specialty chemicals segments as a result of the company carrying less inventory due to the market conditions of the economy at that time 
investing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily related to  payment for the net assets of rising 
in addition   related to purchases of property and equipment and  for intangible assets 
we expect capital expenditures  excluding the new facility  will be between and during fiscal investing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily related to purchases of property and equipment of  payments of  for intangible assets and for net assets of business acquired  offset by payments of  received on notes receivable and  of distributions from a joint venture 
investing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily related to the acquisition of  of product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency and payments to various task force groups related to certain agricultural protection products products  and  of the issuance of a notes receivable related to a supplier agreement 
financing activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  primarily from  of bank loans and  of proceeds from a mortgage  offset by the payment of dividends of  financing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily from the payment of  of dividends  offset by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related to bank loans 
financing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily from the payment of  of dividends and a payment of a note payable partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  credit facilities we have available credit facilities with certain foreign financial institutions 
these facilities provide us with a line of credit of  of which has been utilized during the year ended june   leaving an available balance of  as of june  we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
on december   we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with two financial institutions 
the credit agreement terminates the amended and restated credit agreement  dated april  we may borrow  repay and reborrow during the period ending december   up to but not exceeding at any one time outstanding  the revolving loans 
the revolving loans may be i adjusted libor loans as defined in the credit agreement  ii alternate base rate loans as defined in the credit agreement or iii a combination thereof 
as of june   we borrowed revolving loans aggregating  which loans are adjusted libor loans  at interest rates ranging from to at june   of such amount was utilized by us to partially finance payment of the purchase price for the rising acquisition 
the credit agreement also allows for the borrowing up to  the term loan 
as such  we borrowed a term loan of  on december  to partially finance the acquisition of rising 
the term loan interest may be payable as an i adjusted libor loan  ii alternate base rate loan  or iii a combination thereof 
as of june   the amount outstanding under the term loan is  and is payable as an adjusted libor loan  at interest rates ranging from to at june  the credit agreement also provides that commercial letters of credit shall be issued to provide the primary payment mechanism in connection with the purchase of any materials  goods or services by us in the ordinary course of business 
at june   we had utilized  in bank loans and letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
the terms of these letters of credit are all less than one year 
no material loss is anticipated due to non performance by the counterparties to these agreements 
the credit agreement provides for a security interest in all of our personal property 
the credit agreement contains several financial covenants including  among other things  maintaining a minimum level of debt service 
we are also subject to certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on cash dividends  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
the company has obtained a waiver of its consolidated debt service coverage ratio covenant from its financial institutions for the year ended june  pursuant to the requirements of the credit agreement  we are required to deliver hedging agreements as defined in the credit agreement fixing the interest rate on not less than  of the term loan 
accordingly  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of  which has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the expiration date of this interest rate swap is december  working capital outlook working capital was  at june   versus  at june  the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to the rising acquisition  including approximately  of cash paid for certain assets of rising 
in march  we purchased a building in port washington  new york  which is now the site of our global headquarters 
we moved our corporate offices into this new building in april it is anticipated that the net amount expended on this new facility could approximate  of which approximately  has been spent through june  on june   we entered into a mortgage payable for  on this new corporate headquarters 
this mortgage payable is secured by the land and building and is being amortized over a period of years 
the mortgage payable bears interest at and matures on june  we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
in connection with our agricultural protection business  we plan to continue to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups  which could approximate  over the next fiscal year 
in connection with arsynco  the company could pay out approximately  in fiscal  related to the environmental remediation obligation 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  borrowing capacity and access to the equity capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures and the anticipated continuation of semi annual cash dividends for the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments and contingencies we have no material financial commitments other than those under bank borrowings  operating lease agreements  letters of credit and unconditional purchase obligations 
we have certain contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments that will affect our short and long term liquidity 
at june   we had no significant obligations for capital expenditures 
however  the amount to be expended on the new facility could approximate  in total 
at june   contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments were as follows payments due and or amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations a operating leases commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total a long term debt obligations are comprised of various loans 
interest is not included in the above table as the majority of the debt is variable in nature 
as of june   interest on these variable loans were in the range of to 
other significant commitments and contingencies include the following a subsidiary of the company markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
the company is presently a member of several such task force groups  which requires payments for such memberships 
in addition  in connection with our agricultural protection business  the company plans to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency to support such registrations and other supporting data for six products 
the acquisition of these product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups could approximate  through fiscal  of which has been accrued as of june  we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
the company has environmental remediation obligations in connection with arsynco  inc arsynco  a subsidiary formerly involved in manufacturing chemicals located in carlstadt  new jersey  which was closed in and is currently held for sale 
based on continued monitoring of the contamination at the site and the approved plan of remediation  the company received an estimate from an environmental consultant stating that the costs of remediation could be between  and  remediation has commenced in fiscal  and as of june  and june   a liability of  and  respectively  is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for this matter 
in accordance with gaap  management believes that the majority of costs incurred to remediate the site will be capitalized in preparing the property which is currently classified as held for sale 
an appraisal of the fair value of the property by a third party appraiser supports the assumption that the expected fair value after the remediation is in excess of the amount required to be capitalized 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from those assumed in current estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
in connection with the environmental remediation obligation for arsynco  in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with basf corporation basf  the former owners of the arsynco property 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  basf paid for a portion of the prior remediation costs and going forward  will co remediate the property with the company 
the contract states that basf pay related to past response costs and pay a proportionate share of the future remediation costs 
accordingly  the company had recorded a gain of in fiscal this gain relates to the partial reimbursement of costs of approximately  that the company had previously expensed 
the company also recorded an additional receivable from basf  with an offset against property held for sale  representing its estimated portion of the future remediation costs 
the balance of this receivable for future remediation costs as of june  and june  is  and  respectively  which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in march  arsynco received notice from the epa of its status as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for a site described as the berry s creek study area 
arsynco is one of over prps which have potential liability for the required investigation and remediation of the site 
the estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number of reasons  including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require 
in addition  any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other prps and their financial strength 
based on prior practice in similar situations  it is possible that the state may assert a claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself  and either the federal government or the state or both may assert claims against arsynco for natural resource damages in connection with berry s creek  any such claim with respect to berry s creek could also be asserted against the approximately prps which the epa has identified in connection with that site 
any claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself may also be asserted against basf  the former owners of the arsynco property 
since an amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  no accrual is recorded for these potential future costs 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
in fiscal years   and  the company received letters from the pulvair site group  a group of potentially responsible parties prp group who are working with the state of tennessee the state to remediate a contaminated property in tennessee called the pulvair site 
the prp group has alleged that aceto shipped hazardous substances to the site which were released into the environment 
the state had begun administrative proceedings against the members of the prp group and aceto with respect to the cleanup of the pulvair site and the prp group has begun to undertake cleanup 
the prp group is seeking a settlement of approximately  from the company for its share to remediate the site contamination 
although the company acknowledges that it shipped materials to the site for formulation over twenty years ago  the company believes that the evidence does not show that the hazardous materials sent by aceto to the site have significantly contributed to the contamination of the environment and thus believes that  at most  it is a de minimus contributor to the site contamination 
accordingly  the company believes that the settlement offer is unreasonable 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investment market price risk we had short term investments of at june  those short term investments consisted of time deposits and corporate equity securities 
time deposits are short term in nature and are accordingly valued at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
corporate equity securities are recorded at fair value and have exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would be as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations 
pursuant to the requirements of the credit agreement  the company is required to deliver hedging agreements as defined in the credit agreement fixing the interest rate on not less than  of the term loan 
accordingly  in march  the company entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of  which has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the expiration date of this interest rate swap is december  the unrealized loss associated with this derivative  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at june   is aceto s interest rate swap is classified within level as the fair value of this hedge is primarily based on observable interest rates
