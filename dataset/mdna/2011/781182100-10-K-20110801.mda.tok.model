item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ruby tuesday  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiaries rti  the company  we and or our  owns and operates ruby tuesday  marlin ray s  truffles  and wok hay casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday and wok hay concepts in selected domestic and international markets 
our mission is to be the best in the bar grill sector of the restaurant industry by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
while we are in the bar grill sector because of our varied menu  it is our goal to operate at a higher end casual dining experience in terms of quality  food  and service 
as of may   we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants located in states and the district of columbia 
our traditional franchisees operated domestic and international ruby tuesday restaurants in states  guam  and foreign countries 
in addition  a traditional international franchisee operated one wok hay full service asian restaurant as of may  the company owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the northeast  southeast  mid atlantic  and midwest regions of the united states 
we consider these regions to be our core markets 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal years   and each contained weeks 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do 
in we deployed a brand repositioning initiative designed to clearly differentiate ruby tuesday from our competitors since we believed  as the bar and grill segment continued to mature  our lack of differentiation in this segment would potentially make it increasingly difficult to attract new guests 
our brand repositioning first focused on food  then service  and finally on the creation of a fresh new look for our restaurants  which was the most capital intensive aspect of our reimaging program 
in order to maximize sales in our newly reimaged brand  our marketing strategy for the last three years has focused on the key pillars of print promotions  digital media  and local marketing programs to entice guests to see the new ruby tuesday  increase frequency of visits  and enhance brand visibility 
we believe this marketing strategy more effectively communicates our brand and value message 
we have the ability to customize our marketing to specific markets  down to the individual restaurant level  which enables us to respond quickly with a different program if a specific market or restaurant is not achieving desired results 
while we were in the process of implementing our brand reimaging  consumer spending came under pressure for a variety of reasons  and further weakened in the fourth quarter of calendar as the economic environment deteriorated  operating results for various casual dining concepts  including ours  declined significantly 
in response  beginning in the second half of fiscal  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives to improve our cash flow at no dilution to the overall guest experience 
these cost savings were the result of various labor savings initiatives  including new scheduling systems and the realignment of field supervisors  in addition to more disciplined food cost management  improved operating efficiencies  and the closing of certain underperforming restaurants 
these initiatives resulted in cost savings of approximately million in the second half of fiscal alone 
the improvements we have actualized in sales  earnings growth  and strengthening our balance sheet  in particular with our recently renewed five year revolving credit facility the credit facility  are enabling us to execute on our three to five year strategies to further strengthen and grow our business in a low risk  low capital  high return manner 
the key initiatives in our long range plan are focused in the following four areas enhance sales and margins of our core brand 
we have evolved our existing menu items to support our high quality casual dining position  broaden our appeal with product extensions offering more variety and cravability  and provide our guests with compelling value 
late in the second quarter of fiscal  we introduced a menu which included an expanded appetizer line and new dinner entrees featuring a variety of lobster combinations 
additionally  we have also launched a sunday brunch offering and enhanced our bar area with high definition televisions and an enhanced food and drink menu  both of which have driven incremental sales and traffic in addition to enhancing the overall perception of the ruby tuesday brand 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we rolled out a new menu  began offering a complimentary bread program  and enhanced our fresh garden bar and sunday brunch 
our new menu items include entrees  fit trim offerings  which include menu items that are calories or less  and side offerings which now include fresh grilled green beans  fresh grilled zucchini  baked mac n cheese  and blue cheese coleslaw 
we enhanced our garden bar with more variety and freshness by adding over new items 
the addition of our fresh baked garlic cheese biscuits should further increase the overall value perception of our brand  in line with other high quality casual dining restaurants 
lastly  our sunday brunch menu now includes total items  and has been enhanced with the addition of french toast and new omelets 
from a labor standpoint  we deployed a new management structure which has our assistant managers now designated as either guest service managers or culinary managers  and is enabling us to focus on delivering a more consistent guest experience 
we have also implemented smaller station sizes  increased bartender staffing levels  and added food runners to improve the dining experience 
both the menu enhancements and the labor changes noted above are designed to enhance the overall experience for our guests in line with the leading high quality casual dining dinner houses 
increase shareholder returns through new concept conversions 
part of our long term plan is to get more out of existing restaurants by generating higher average restaurant volumes and thus more profit and cash flow with minimal capital investment 
therefore  we will be converting certain underperforming ruby tuesday concept restaurants into other high quality casual dining brands which might be better suited for success in selected markets 
to that end  on july   we entered into a licensing agreement with gourmet market  inc which allows us to operate multiple restaurants under the truffles name 
truffles is an upscale casual dining caf featuring seafood and steaks which currently operates three restaurants in the vicinity of hilton head island  south carolina 
our potential conversion concepts now include truffles  wok hay an asian bistro which we own  and marlin ray s  which is our new internally developed seafood concept 
we anticipate converting approximately six to eight company owned ruby tuesday restaurants to the marlin ray s  truffles  or wok hay concepts in fiscal we believe the low capital requirement and potential increased revenue and ebitda for these conversions have the potential to provide attractive cash on cash returns for our shareholders 
focus on low risk  low capital intensive  high return growth 
in an effort to be prudent with our capital and in order to maximize returns for our shareholders  we are starting to slowly grow our company in a low risk  low capital intensive manner 
over time  we plan on opening company owned  smaller inline type ruby tuesday restaurants 
additionally  on september   we entered into a licensing agreement with lfmg international  llc lime which allows us to operate multiple restaurants under the lime fresh mexican grill name 
lime is a fast casual mexican concept that currently operates several restaurants primarily in the vicinity of miami  florida 
given that the fast casual segment of our industry is a proven and growing segment where demand exceeds supply  we believe opening smaller  inline locations under the lime brand is a potential growth option for us 
we expect to open seven to nine company owned lime restaurants in fiscal the ability to enter the growing fast casual segment with a strong brand such as lime and further expand our ruby tuesday company owned brand provides a growth option that has the potential to create long term value for our shareholders with relatively low risk 
allocate capital to enhance shareholder value 
during the past year  we continued to strengthen our balance sheet through deleveraging and also entered into a new credit facility which provides us with greater flexibility 
if we are successful in continuing to stabilize our same restaurant sales and maintaining or lowering our cost structure  we have the opportunity to generate substantial levels of free cash flow given our modest capital expenditure needs 
we define free cash flow to be the net amount remaining when purchases of property and equipment are subtracted from net cash provided by operating activities 
our near term capital requirements are relatively modest as we anticipate converting six to eight ruby tuesday concept restaurants into other concepts  opening one to two new restaurants  and opening approximately seven to nine smaller  inline lime restaurants in fiscal we generated million of free cash flow in fiscal  all of which was used to repay debt 
we estimate we will generate to million of free cash flow during fiscal included in these estimates is anticipated capital spending of to million 
during fiscal  we assumed million of long term debt in connection with franchise restaurant acquisitions 
our objective over the next several years is to be in a position to return excess capital to our shareholders through an opportunistic share repurchase program or to continue to reduce debt in order to further reduce the financial risk related to our leverage 
see further discussion in the financing activities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
our success in the four key long range plan initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our return on assets and return on equity  and to create additional shareholder value 
our same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants increased in fiscal and our diluted earnings per share decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal throughout this md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail  provide insight for fiscal years and  as well as discuss known events  uncertainties  and trends 
we hope our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance 
we remind you  that  in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in part ii  item of this form k 
results of operations ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned domestic franchise international franchise total during fiscal company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were acquired  including purchased from certain of our franchise partnerships and three purchased from a traditional domestic franchisee  we opened our first truffles and marlin ray s concept restaurants  each of which was converted from an existing ruby tuesday concept restaurant  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were closed  three of which have been converted to then existing concepts  one in anticipation of conversion to another high quality casual dining concept  and two as the result of tornadic activity in april  and aside from the restaurants sold to the company  seven franchise restaurants were opened and were closed

restaurant sales restaurant sales in fiscal increased from fiscal for company owned restaurants and decreased for domestic and international franchised restaurants as explained below 
the tables presented below reflect restaurant sales for the last five years  and other revenue information for the last three years 
restaurant sales in millions fiscal year company owned franchise a a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
other revenue information company restaurant sales in thousands company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue in thousands a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue in thousands total revenue growth percentage company same restaurant sales growth percentage company average restaurant volumes million million million company average restaurant volumes growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license  and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended may  increased to  million compared to the prior year 
the increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees in fiscal and a increase in same restaurant sales 
included in our restaurant sales and operating revenue for fiscal are million of restaurant sales for restaurants we acquired from our franchisees during the current year 
the increase in same restaurant sales for fiscal is attributable to higher average net check in the current year due to a shift in our value positioning and print incentive strategy since the prior year and a change in menu mix from the rollout of our new menu in august of fiscal  offset by an overall decrease in guest traffic compared to the prior year 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended june  decreased to  million compared to fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from the closing of restaurants in fiscal and a decrease in same restaurant sales 
the closed restaurants produced million of restaurant sales in fiscal the decrease in same restaurant sales for fiscal is attributable to declines in average net check during the first two quarters of fiscal due to our value positioning and print incentive strategy to motivate new guests to visit our restaurants to experience the reimaged ruby tuesday brand 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties up to of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue increased to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in fiscal is due to an increase in royalties from our traditional domestic franchisees as we recognized royalty fees due from a traditional domestic franchisee who previously had been deferring payment in the current year  coupled with an increase in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants of for the year ended may  the decrease in fiscal is due to franchise store closures  temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees  and a decrease in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants of for fiscal under our accounting policy  we do not recognize franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or  historically  in regards to the franchise partnerships  through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
accordingly  we have deferred recognition of a portion of franchise revenue from certain franchises 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of may  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in unearned income is primarily attributable to a reduction in unearned fees due from domestic franchisees million as a result of the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees during fiscal total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is primarily due to the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees during fiscal the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in average restaurant volumes as a result of a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales 
operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item of this form k 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation as a percentage of total revenue selling  general  and administrative  net of support service fees closures and impairments goodwill impairment equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss pre tax income loss pre tax income decreased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  the lower pre tax income was due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  selling  general  and administrative  net  and closures and impairments  and higher equity in losses from unconsolidated equity method franchises 
these higher costs were partially offset by million in pre tax income on the restaurants acquired from franchisees during fiscal  an increase in same restaurant sales of at company owned restaurants  and decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of depreciation  and interest expense  net 
for fiscal  pre tax income was million or of total revenue  as compared to a pre tax loss of million or of total revenue  for fiscal the increase in pre tax income from fiscal was due in significant part to reductions in impairment charges as we announced a plan in the prior year to restructure our property portfolio which resulted in closures and impairments expense of million during fiscal also during fiscal we impaired our goodwill million 
the increase also included the elimination of million in pre tax losses recorded in fiscal on the restaurants closed that year  as well as decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation  selling  general  and administrative  net  and interest expense  net 
these lower costs were partially offset by a decline of in same restaurant sales at company owned restaurants  lower franchise revenue  higher losses from unconsolidated equity method franchises  and increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  of cost of merchandise 
in the paragraphs that follow  we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre tax income for years ended may  and june  as compared to the comparable prior year 
because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate  we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  as well as the absolute dollar change  to the comparable prior year 
fiscal year franchise restaurant acquisitions the table below shows operating results from the dates of acquisition which occurred between august  and may  for the year ended may  for the restaurants that were acquired from domestic franchisees in fiscal in thousands total revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation selling  general  and administrative income before income taxes fiscal year restaurant closings the table below shows operating results for the year ended june  for the restaurants that closed in fiscal in thousands total revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation selling  general  and administrative net loss cost of merchandise cost of merchandise increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise increased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  cost of merchandise decreased million 
for the year ended may   the absolute dollar change not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions was due to lower food costs at our other restaurants as a result of a decrease in guest counts during the current year 
contributing to the lower guest counts during fiscal was inclement winter weather in many of our core markets during the third quarter and lower guest counts in our first and fourth quarters as a result of a shift in our value promotion strategy by changing the buy one get one free promotion offered during the first quarter of the prior year to a buy one get one free up to or a off on our specialties  fork tender ribs  and handcrafted steaks and reducing the number of system wide freestanding insert coupons offered during the current versus the prior year 
partially offsetting the decrease in cost of sales due to guest counts were the addition of garlic cheese biscuits  produce price increases  and wine costs as discussed below 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase in cost of merchandise for the year ended may  was due to primarily to the rollout of garlic cheese biscuits at all of our restaurants  price increases during the second half of the current year on several produce items due to the winter freeze that impacted crops in mexico  and increased wine cost due in part to higher sales of our premium wines during the current year 
cost of merchandise decreased million from fiscal to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise increased from to 
excluding the million decrease from the elimination of restaurants closed in fiscal  cost of merchandise increased million 
the million increase for the year ended june  referred to above was a result of a shift in menu mix corresponding to our value promotions which drove our guests to order higher cost menu items  coupled with the introduction of higher food cost items such as lobster entrees on our new menus 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase was due to several promotions offered during fiscal including freestanding insert coupons in all markets with company owned restaurants  direct address label mail pieces  and a value promotion for our so connected guests offering a buy one get one free or a buy one get one free up to on our specialties  fork tender ribs  and handcrafted steaks 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs increased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased million 
for the year ended may   the decrease in absolute dollars not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions was insignificant 
as a percentage of restaurants sales and operating revenue  the increase in payroll and related costs was due to higher hourly labor which resulted from additional hours scheduled for saturday nights  additional bartender labor on monday nights during football season  increased labor associated with the rollout of our bread program  and unfavorable state unemployment costs due to rate increases in states 
payroll and related costs decreased million from fiscal to million for the year ended june  this amount included million of payroll and related costs spent in fiscal at the restaurants closed in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs decreased from to 
for the year ended june   the remaining decrease of million not attributable to closings was primarily due to decreases in hourly labor as a result of new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants and the elimination of the dedicated to go positions in our mall restaurants and certain other locations  both of which were partially offset by increases in minimum wage rates and payroll taxes in certain states since fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease in payroll and related costs in fiscal was attributable to the impact of closing restaurants in fiscal  which ran higher than system average labor  and the hourly labor cost savings initiatives discussed in the prior paragraph 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  these costs increased from to

these were partially offset by increased guaranty expense relating primarily to debt defaults by certain franchisees we chose not to acquire and which now have ceased operations  higher repairs expense due to impinger oven maintenance  increased costs associated with the inclement winter weather during the current year  and an overall increase in building repairs as we incurred costs to maintain the look of our restaurants from the reimaging completed in fiscal other offsets include upgrading our cable packages during the current year to offer a greater variety of sports programming in our bar area of certain restaurants  higher credit card expense due in part to increases in processing fees charged by our credit card vendors coupled with accrued income in the prior year relating to the net proceeds from the visa mastercard antitrust class action litigation of which we were a class member

these were partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance due to upgrades and repairs at certain of our restaurants and higher general liability insurance expense due to unfavorable claims experience 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  this expense decreased from to 
in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease was primarily due to reduced depreciation for assets that became fully depreciated since the prior year  which was partially offset by increased depreciation on the restaurants acquired from franchisees in fiscal depreciation expense decreased million to million for fiscal  compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  this expense decreased from to 
in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease for fiscal was primarily due to reduced depreciation for assets that became fully depreciated since fiscal reductions of million 
additionally  contributing to the reduction was the impact of the restaurant closures which incurred depreciation expenses totaling million in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses  net of support service fee income  increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended may  excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  selling  general and administrative  net of support service fee income increased million 
the increase was primarily due to higher advertising costs million as a result of testing a marketing initiative by inserting coupons in certain national magazines  an increase in internet advertising due to the implementation of digital media since the prior year  and higher advertising agency fees and television advertising during the current year 
also contributing to the increase were higher management labor and training payroll million due to an increase  since the prior fiscal year  in team members  travel and related costs million as a result of an increase in training sessions during the current year  share based compensation expense million  and higher consulting fees million  primarily relating to cost savings initiatives 
these were partially offset by a reduction in bonus expense million based on fiscal results and higher capitalized development expense during the current year as a result of restaurant conversions million 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  net of support service fee income  decreased million to million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease included million of costs incurred in fiscal on the closed restaurants 
the decrease in absolute dollars from fiscal to was partially attributable to a reduction in advertising million as a result of no national cable television advertising during fiscal  reflecting a shift in our marketing strategy to one based more on offering guests incentives through print media rather than through television 
additionally  management labor was lower million due to the elimination and reduction of certain positions 
these were partially offset by higher bonus expense million and higher share based employee compensation million due to improved achievement of performance goals 
closures and impairments closures and impairments increased million to million for the year ended may   as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher restaurant impairment charges million and losses on the sale of surplus properties during fiscal compared to gains on the sale of surplus properties in the prior fiscal year million  which were partially offset by reductions in closed restaurant lease reserve expense million  other closing costs million  and dead site costs million 
closures and impairments expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to reductions in impairment charges million  closed restaurant lease reserve expense million  dead site costs million  other closing costs million  and higher gains on the sale of surplus properties million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal   and goodwill impairment we concluded during the second quarter of fiscal that our goodwill at the time was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge during fiscal of million 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our fiscal goodwill impairment charge and our current goodwill 
equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the change is attributable to increased losses from investments in two of our owned franchise partnerships  both of which were acquired during fiscal included in these increased losses was million  which represents our share of an impairment loss recorded on a closed franchise restaurant 
offsetting this were decreased losses or increased earnings from investments in four of our owned franchise partnerships  all of which were acquired during fiscal as of may   we had acquired all of our owned franchise partnerships 
for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises was million compared to negligible equity in earnings for fiscal the change is attributable to increased losses from investments in three of our six owned franchise partnerships over fiscal contributing to our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises were lower same restaurant sales  which was partially offset by an increase in earnings from investments in the other three owned franchise partnerships over fiscal and by lower advertising charges during fiscal as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended may   primarily due to lower average debt outstanding on our revolving credit agreement and the payoff of the private placement series a senior notes in the prior year 
net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   primarily due to lower average debt outstanding on the revolving credit agreement  the retirement of the private placement series a senior notes  lower interest rates on the credit facility  and other debt payments made since fiscal provision benefit for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to an increase in the benefit of fica tip and work opportunity tax credits during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  coupled with the exclusion for tax purposes of net gains from franchise acquisitions in fiscal these benefits were partially offset by the recognition of a deferred tax valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the change in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the fact that the company reported an operating loss in fiscal and income in fiscal fica tip credits and work opportunity tax credits generated in fiscal increased the effective tax rate above the statutory rate 
the two tax credits are driven primarily by restaurant sales  rather than closures and impairments and goodwill impairment  which together contributed significantly to the fiscal operating loss 
a similar amount of tax credits generated in fiscal decreased the effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used provided by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and short term investments operating activities our cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees 
substantially all of the  million   million  and  million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and  respectively  was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days when our guests paid with debit or credit cards 
our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases  payroll and benefit costs  restaurant operating costs  general and administrative expenses  and marketing  a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal decreased million from the prior year to million 
the decrease was due primarily to an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  a substantial portion of which is due to a prior year federal refund related to a tax accounting method change as permitted by the internal revenue service relating to the expensing of certain repairs 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal increased million from fiscal to million 
the increase was due to an increase in net income  after non cash adjustments 
the increase in net income of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the after tax impact of a substantial decline in non cash impairment charges and lower depreciation in fiscal compared with fiscal excluding these items  as well as the other non cash items which impact net income  the increase in net income was million 
these and other factors leading to our net income increase are discussed in the results of operations section of our md a 
net cash collected for income taxes was million in fiscal as opposed to million in fiscal due primarily to a tax accounting method change  as permitted by the internal revenue service  relating to the expensing of certain repairs and a collection of the carryback of the federal net operating losses generated in fiscal included in the million increase in net income mentioned above are changes in deferred income taxes relating to this tax accounting method change 
offsetting these increases were various uses of cash including additional outlays for inventory million  due in part to the advance purchase of lobster as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and increased payments associated with closed store leases million due to additional payments for lease settlements in fiscal our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of may  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset or debt reduction a long term liability and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new or converted restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  proceeds from the disposal of assets produced million  million  and million of cash in fiscal   and  respectively  following an action taken to aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be to million based on our planned improvements for existing restaurants and our expectation that we will open one to two new restaurants  approximately seven to nine lime restaurants  and convert approximately six to eight company owned ruby tuesday concept restaurants to the marlin ray s  truffles  or wok hay concepts in fiscal we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire the remaining member or limited partnership interests of franchise partnerships which collectively operated restaurants  one additional restaurant from a twelfth franchise partnership  and three restaurants from a traditional domestic franchisee 
financing activities historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or  more recently  through the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
our current borrowings and credit facilities are described below 
on december   we entered into the credit facility  under which we may borrow up to million with the option to increase our capacity by million to million 
the credit facility replaced our then outstanding five year revolving credit agreement the prior credit facility that was entered into on february  bank of america  na  serves as administrative agent  issuing bank  servicer and swingline lender under the credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility provide for a million swingline subcommitment and a million letter of credit subcommitment 
the credit facility also includes a million franchise facility subcommitment  which covered our guarantees of debt of the franchise partners franchise facility subcommitment and replaced a prior franchise facility the franchise facility  which was dated as of november  the interest rate charged on borrowings pursuant to the credit facility can vary depending on the interest rate option we choose to utilize

during fiscal  we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock at per share  less underwriting discounts 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
the net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our previously outstanding five year prior credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we had borrowings of million with an associated floating rate of interest of at may  as of june   under the terms of the prior credit facility  we had million outstanding with an associated floating rate of interest of 
after consideration of letters of credit outstanding and amounts borrowed under the franchise facility subcommitment  we had million available under the credit facility as of may  the credit facility contains financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum net worth 
the covenants  as well as the conditions to each borrowing  are substantially similar to those contained in the prior credit facility 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants both as of may  and the date of this filing 
on december   we drew down approximately million under the credit facility to repay borrowings outstanding under the prior credit facility 
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing were paid from cash on hand 
additionally  new letters of credit totaling million were obtained to replace those outstanding under the prior credit facility 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on july   we entered into an amendment of the credit facility to increase the amount of the optional additional revolving commitments available from million to million  thereby increasing the maximum aggregate revolving commitment amount under the credit facility from million to million 
on the same date  we exercised our option to increase the revolving commitments from million to million pursuant to new lender commitment agreements with the existing lenders and an additional new lender 
on april   we issued notes totaling million through a private placement of debt the private placement 
on december   we entered into an amendment of the notes issued in the private placement note amendment 
among other changes discussed below  this amendment conformed the covenants in this agreement to the covenants contained in the credit facility discussed above 
at may  and june   the private placement consisted of million and million  respectively  in notes with an interest rate of the series b notes 
the series b notes mature on april  during the first two quarters of fiscal  we offered  and our noteholders accepted  principal prepayments of million on the series b notes 
under the terms of the note amendment we are no longer required to offer principal prepayments to our noteholders 
accordingly  we have not classified any of the million principal balance as current as of may  in connection with the credit facility and note amendment  on december   bank of america  na  as collateral agent  along with the lenders and institutional investors pursuant to the credit facility and note amendment  issued a notice of direction and termination effectively terminating the intercreditor and collateral agency agreement by and between such parties dated may   and also terminating the pledge agreement dated may  by and among ruby tuesday  inc and certain subsidiaries of ruby tuesday  inc 
together the pledgors and the creditors pursuant to the credit facility and note amendment  by which the pledgors had pledged certain subsidiary equity interests as security for the repayment of our obligations under the credit facility and note amendment 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired all remaining membership interests in franchise partnerships in fiscal in connection with these acquisitions  we assumed million of long term debt 
of this amount  million was owed to the lenders of the franchise facility subcommitment 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we repaid the million using borrowings from our prior credit facility in first quarter and our credit facility in third and fourth quarters 
our million in mortgage loan obligations as of may  consists of various loans acquired upon franchise acquisitions 
these loans  which mature between july and march  have balances which range from negligible to million and interest rates of to 
many of the properties acquired from franchisees collateralize the loans outstanding 
there were no share repurchases or dividends paid during fiscal   or share repurchases from time to time our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock as a means to return excess capital to our shareholders 
the timing  price  quantity  and manner of the purchases have been made at the discretion of management upon instruction from the board of directors  depending upon market conditions and the restrictions contained in our loan agreements 
although million shares remained available for purchase under existing programs at may   we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock during fiscal the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future

critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method  which requires  among other things  that most assets and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values 
we record goodwill when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the determination of estimated fair values of assets and liabilities requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the estimated future cash flows  estimated useful lives of assets  and appropriate discount rates 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities assumed from our franchisee acquisitions are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period under accounting standards codification topic  business combinations  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require a change to our estimates 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is market participant based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one full quarter shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at may   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows  of which have been impaired to salvage value 
of the six which remained  we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the restaurants and determined no impairment was necessary 
the remaining net book value of these six restaurants was million at may  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
our goodwill  which totaled million at may   is not amortized 
we perform tests for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use  estimates of sales proceeds and other measures  such as fair market price of our common stock  as evidenced by closing trading price 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if market conditions deteriorate  or if operating results decline unexpectedly  we may be required to record impairment charges 
share based employee compensation share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to approval of the award by our board of directors 
we determine the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
revenue recognition for franchisees we charge our franchisees various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and an advertising fee of up to 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or  historically  in regards to the franchise partnerships  through a facility for which we provided a guaranty 
we also do not recognize franchise fee revenue from franchises with fees in excess of days past due 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of may  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when certain state net operating losses that  in the judgment of management  are not more likely than not to be realized 
this determination factors in the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
as a result of impairment charges during fiscal and state tax planning  the company has a three year cumulative pre tax loss in certain states which is to be given significant weight in our assessments 
we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million as of may  as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on the presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income 
this guidance is intended to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  our fiscal first quarter 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
known events  uncertainties  and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility 
this strategy has periodically allowed us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended may   we repurchased no shares of rti common stock 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of may   is approximately million 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  future repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings 
the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders 
the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors 
our last dividend was paid on august  and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
fiscal year rti s fiscal year will contain weeks and end on june  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate  and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our base rate for borrowings is defined to be the higher of bank of america s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus  or an adjusted libo rate plus  plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin for our eurodollar borrowings ranges from to 
as of may   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
