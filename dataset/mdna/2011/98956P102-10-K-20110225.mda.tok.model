item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 
certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
overview we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is percentage point above the rate of growth from compared to we believe long term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population  growth in emerging markets  obesity  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the ongoing shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes  trabecular metal technology products  hip stems with kinectiv technology  high flex knees  knee revision products  porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices  is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 
pricing trends global selling prices decreased percent during selling prices in the americas  europe and asia pacific decreased percent  were flat  and decreased percent  respectively  during we continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 
in the americas  we have experienced compression of historic pricing differentials amongst our customers 
asia pacific was especially influenced by a bi annual pricing adjustment in japan that went into effect on april  due to these pressures  we expect selling prices will continue to have a negative to percent effect on sales on a global basis in foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a percent increase in sales 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with year end rates  we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and  under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to offsetting gains losses on hedge contracts and options  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
global economic conditions we believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have negatively affected elective hospital procedures 
in the fourth quarter of  we saw some stabilization in procedure volumes and we believe the number of procedures will increase as the global economy strengthens 
despite the current conditions of the global economy  it is well known that demographic trends will expand the patient base that needs our products 
we believe these factors will ultimately foster long term sustained growth even if in the short term the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected 
outlook we estimate our sales will grow between and percent in such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment 
as discussed previously  we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth by to percent  and foreign currency exchange rates to have a positive effect on sales growth by approximately percent based upon december  rates 
assuming currency rates remain at december  rates  we expect our gross margin to be approximately percent of sales in this takes into account anticipated losses from foreign currency hedge losses resulting from relative weakness in the us dollar 
we expect to continue making investments in research and development r d in the range of to percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of sales is expected to be between and percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and leverage revenue growth 
we expect to incur to million of expenses in related to certain global restructuring and transformation initiatives 
we also expect to incur an additional to million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions 
we anticipate recognizing some of the to million in cost of products sold and the majority in special items on our statement of net earnings 
the gross margin and sg a percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 
we expect interest and other expense to be approximately million in  which is slightly lower than as we have entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert a portion of our billion senior notes from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt

our knee sales have been affected by broader economic conditions impacting volume mix and competitive pressures from newer knee systems that have more modern surgical instruments for implantation 
we intend to counter these competitive pressures in and thereafter as we continue to launch our new patient specific and posterior referencing instrumentation systems  as well as through new product development 
the nexgen complete knee solution product line  including gender solutions knee femoral implants  the nexgen lps flex knee and the nexgen cr flex knee  together with the gender solutions natural knee flex system led knee sales

hips hip sales rebounded from negative growth in to positive growth in driven by new product introductions  such as our continuum acetabular system and our zimmer m l taper stem with kinectiv technology 
the zimmer m l taper stem  the zimmer m l taper stem with kinectiv technology  the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweym ller hip stem led hip stem sales

dental dental sales have experienced a significant turnaround from a negative percent decline in to positive percent growth in in  our dental sales were affected more by the global economic environment than our other product categories  as many dental procedures are not reimbursed by third party payors 
sales were led by the tapered screw vent implant system 
additionally  regenerative products have exhibited strong sales growth in trauma trauma sales increased in the mid single digits the past two years 
zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst intertrochanteric subtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales  while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution 
in  we initiated the launch of the zimmer natural nail system  which made a strong contribution to sales 
we anticipate that a broader launch of that system will continue to positively affect sales growth 
spine in the fourth quarter of we acquired abbott spine 
as a result of the acquisition  spine sales increased in  but underlying that performance were sales losses associated with integration of the business 
in  once we anniversaried out of the additional sales from the acquisition  we experienced sales declines  most notably in our americas segment 
in addition to the operational challenges associated with the integration of the abbott spine business in the americas  a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in our dynesys dynamic stabilization system have affected sales 
in contrast to the americas  our spine sales grew in europe and asia pacific in driven by the stabilization of our distribution channels  which followed the abbott spine integration activity of overall  solid sales of the pathfinder and sequoia pedicle screw systems  our universal clamp system and our trinica anterior cervical plate system partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system 
surgical and other surgical and other sales went from percent sales growth in to percent sales growth in in  we voluntarily recalled and suspended production of certain patient care products  and were able to reintroduce those products during the year in accordingly  sales were suppressed  especially in the first half of the year  but we started to regain market share in the second half of and throughout surgical sales were led by palacos bone cement  wound debridement products  tourniquet products and powered instruments

these increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories  as well as to increase spending on external research  clinical  regulatory and quality initiatives 
additionally  in we experienced some delay in r d activities as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program 
we continue to expect r d spending to be between to percent of sales in sg a has increased in dollars terms over the last three years  but as a percent of sales was lower in and compared to in  sg a increased in dollar terms from primarily for variable selling and distribution expenses as sales were higher than sales  and from increased spending to fund medical education programs 
sg a as a percent of sales in decreased by basis points from  reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales  and no expense in related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of in  sg a as a percent of sales increased approximately basis points compared to sg a expense in the period included approximately million of incremental costs  such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of enhancements to our compliance program 
the savings from these costs in were offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs  abbott spine costs and increased product liability claims 
the acquisition of abbott spine increased sg a costs for items such as selling expenses  increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets 
additionally  sg a as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates 
a majority of our sg a spend is incurred in the us  primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as dental  trauma  spine and surgical 
therefore  sg a expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue  which caused sg a as a percentage of net sales to increase in compared to certain claims expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries 
provisions of million and million were originally recorded during and  respectively  with an additional million recorded during  bringing the total provision to million for these claims 
for more information regarding these claims  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of and  we noted that the carrying values of the assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
as a result  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimate the fair values of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
for each of those five other reporting units  the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value

special items also includes the impairment of an available for sale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 
special items in included a workforce realignment  which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support long term growth 
as a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions  we incurred approximately million of severance and termination related expenses

the effective tax rates for and are negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  for which no tax benefit was recorded 
the goodwill impairment charges have increased the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and by approximately percent and percent  respectively 
additionally  in the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies 
the effective tax rate for includes the impact of a current tax benefit of million related to a us government civil settlement expense  resulting in a decrease of approximately percent in the effective tax rate 
this impact on the effective tax rate was partially offset by abbott spine acquisition related in process research and development charges recorded during for which no tax benefit was recorded 
these discrete items account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rates in the past three years 
as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously  net earnings in decreased percent compared to in  net earnings decreased percent compared to basic and diluted earnings per share decreased percent in compared to  while basic and diluted earnings per share decreased percent and percent  respectively  from the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases made in the last three years 
non gaap operating performance measures we use non gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our non gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step up charges  special items  certain claims  net curtailment and settlement and goodwill impairment  and the taxes on those items and the tax benefit related to a civil settlement 
we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our on going operating results  it helps to better identify operating trends and perform trend analysis that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items  and provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items 
certain of these non gaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 
our non gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  and our non gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were   and  respectively 
our non gaap adjusted net earnings increased in compared to due to increased sales  disciplined spending in sg a  and the absence of monitor related expenses in such increases to non gaap adjusted net earnings were slightly offset by increased r d and medical education expenses and increased interest expense from the senior unsecured notes issued in our non gaap adjusted net earnings decreased in compared to as lower sales and higher r d and medical education expenses reduced non gaap adjusted net earnings 
additionally  non gaap adjusted net earnings featured a million pre tax gain related to sales of certain marketable securities 
the period did contain some expense savings such as the million of incremental savings related to monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of enhancements to our compliance program  but such savings were not enough to offset the other items that reduced non gaap adjusted net earnings

healthcare reform in the us we continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform legislation passed in by the us federal government will have on our business 
the new law includes a percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were  million in compared to  million in the principal source of cash from operating activities in was net earnings 
non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another million of operating cash 
all other items of operating cash flows in provided million of cash 
the resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the period compared to the delay in similar payments during the period as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program 
the resolution of these outstanding payments  along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the period and product liability payments  contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in accrued expenses did not have any such significant variations in  thus reflecting lower outflows in in our indirect statement of cash flows when compared to we have paid approximately million and million in and  respectively  related to durom cup product liability claims 
we estimate the remaining liability for durom cup claims as of december   is million 
we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next three years 
at december   we had days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable  an increase of days when compared to december   reflecting some changes in collection practices that may have slightly increased days sales outstanding  but have decreased our costs to collect at an acceptable risk level 
at december   we had days of inventory on hand  a slight increase of days compared to december  cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in additions to instruments increased in compared to the period to support new product launches  such as our continuum acetabular system  and as we introduced new instrumentation in our knee product category such as posterior referencing instrumentation 
in  we expect to spend approximately to million on instruments to support new products and sales growth 
spending on other property  plant and equipment decreased in compared to the period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in during  we expect to purchase approximately to million in other property  plant and equipment  reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new product related investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment 
beginning in and with more significance in  we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities 
the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities 
acquired intellectual property rights decreased to million in compared to million in and million in these items relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements 
these lump sum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangements 
included in investing cash flows in were million paid to acquire abbott spine and million of proceeds we received from the sale of certain equity securities 
in the past three years  we have made other smaller business acquisitions including beijing montagne medical device co  ltd  sodem diffusion sa and foreign based distributors 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for  compared to million in in  the only significant cash we used in financing activities related to the repurchase of million of our common stock 
in november  we sold billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes senior notes in a public offering 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  net of an offering discount of million 
we also paid an additional million of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the senior notes

we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 
we have a five year  million revolving  multi currency  senior unsecured credit facility maturing november  senior credit facility 
we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december   and an availability of  million 
we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling million 
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we invest only in high quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 
as of december  we had short term and long term investments in debt securities with a fair value of million 
these investments are in debt securities of many different counterparties and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single counterparty 
all these debt securities are highly rated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the counterparties is low 
as of december   million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the u 
s and expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences 
approximately million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk 
the remaining is denominated in the various currencies where we operate 
we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program 
as of december   approximately billion remained authorized under a billion repurchase program  which will expire on december  management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary 
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions and and and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations approximately percent of the other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans 
defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans  they are not based upon future contributions 
due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and our intentions on voluntary contributions  we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond therefore  this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 
also included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon 
due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities  such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made 
therefore  this table does not include any obligations related to uncertain tax benefits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these uncertain tax benefits 
we have entered into various contractual agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r d milestones  sales milestones  or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product 
since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made  we have not included them in this table 
these payments could range from to million 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in process inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws  our experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
in addition to our general product liability  we have recorded certain claims provisions totaling million related to the durom cup  including million in the additional provision was needed in in part because we revised the definition of certain claims recorded in our statement of earnings to include worldwide claims relating to all revisions of durom cup cases where the original surgery was performed before our july  suspension of marketing and distribution  regardless of the time period elapsed between the original surgery and the revision surgery 
this additional provision represents management s updated estimate of liability to durom cup patients undergoing revisions associated with original surgeries occurring before july  the remaining liability as of december  is million 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
as of december   we had intangible assets of million related to trademarks and trade names  of which million are classified as having an indefinite life 
we currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names 
while it is possible  it is not known if these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names 
if these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names  these assets may be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined our us spine reporting unit s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches 
fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology  which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of million during the year ended december  in the year ended december  
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report  we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges 
we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
for each of those five reporting units  the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value 
share based payment we measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through june the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  were billion 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  were million 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december  were euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd  usd korean won  usd swedish krona  usd czech koruna  usd thai baht  usd taiwan dollar  usd south african rand  usd russian ruble and usd indian ruppee 
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in euros and japanese yen 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency remeasurement gains losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of to months  where available  on these commodities to alleviate

form k annual report the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits 
we also have short term and long term investments in highly rated corporate debt securities  us government and agency debt securities  us government treasury funds  municipal bonds  foreign government debt securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 
presently  all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at short term rates 
in december  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of million that hedge a portion of our million percent senior notes due november  on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december   we receive a fixed interest rate of percent and we pay variable interest equal to the three month libor plus an average of basis points 
the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 
these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap 
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on net interest expense 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  derivative instruments  counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry where we do business  there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer
