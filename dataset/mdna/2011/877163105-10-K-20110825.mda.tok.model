the company leases a separate warehouse for storage from an unrelated third party  consisting of approximately  square feet at per month 
the warehouse is located approximately one quarter mile from the above referenced production facilities and office space 
the total rental expense incurred by the company for this facility in fiscal was  the company also leases a separate facility for painting  packaging and shipping from an unrelated third party  consisting of approximately  square feet at  per month 
the facility is located in the town of tonawanda  new york  approximately four miles from the above referenced production facilities and office space 
the total rental expense incurred by the company for this facility in fiscal was  the company believes it is carrying adequate insurance coverage on its facilities and their contents 
proposed expansion several years ago the demand for the company large seismic dampers reached a level where the company had reached the floor space capacity in its tonawanda island facilities 
the company added the lease facilities in the town of tonawanda as a short term solution 
the past three years sales volume combined with a product mix skewed heavily towards larger seismic damages has stretched all of the company current facilities to their limits 
the company has a need for additional manufacturing space 
management believes that the recent series of major earthquakes worldwide should result in increased sales of the company products to the world construction market in the ensuing years 
in  the company began a study considering additional buildings for the tonawanda island site 
this study determined that to maintain proper production flow through the buildings required many costly changes to the site 
the study concluded that it is not cost effective to add additional floor space to the present site 
as a result  the company is contemplating three possible nearby locations  each with enough building space to house all of its present machining operations 
the existing tonawanda island site would then have enough free floor space to assemble and test all products for the foreseeable future 
the new facilities would essentially become the company parts manufacturing center with the main facilities on tonawanda island continuing as the product assembly and testing center in addition to housing corporate  sales  engineering and accounting functions 
in the near term  an aggressive schedule contemplates having new capabilities come on line beginning in the spring of on august   the date of filing of this report  the company was in negotiations to purchase a specific site with existing buildings

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the company financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as discussed below  our financial position or results of operations may be materially affected when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company financial statements 
accounts receivable our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
accounts receivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts after considering the age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved 
balances that are collected  for which a credit to a valuation allowance had previously been recorded  result in a current period reversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting a valuation allowance 
balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable in the current period 
the actual amount of accounts written off over the five year period ended may  equaled less than of sales for that period 
the balance of the valuation allowance remained constant since may  at the current level of  management does not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current accounts receivable balance 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market 
average cost approximates first in  first out cost 
maintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life cycle in excess of twelve months 
this stock represents certain items the company is required to maintain for service of products sold  and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering 
this inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines  rapid technological advances and product obsolescence 
therefore  management of the company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence 
based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time  we determine the amount in the inventory allowance 
if these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes  we may be required to record additional reserves 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company estimates 
the provision for potential inventory obsolescence was  for each of the years ended may  and revenue recognition sales are recognized when units are delivered or services are performed 
sales under fixed price contracts are recorded as deliveries are made at the contract sales price of the units delivered 
sales under certain fixed price contracts requiring substantial performance over several periods prior to commencement of deliveries  are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenues are recognized based on estimates of completion prepared on a ratio of cost to total estimated cost basis 
costs include all material and direct and indirect charges related to specific contracts 
other expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
total estimated costs for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of historical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the completion of the manufacturing process 
adjustments to cost and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements 
these changes may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
if total costs calculated upon completion of the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at completion used to calculate revenue in a prior period  then the revenue and profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs used in the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company estimates 
in the fiscal year ended may   of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting while the remaining of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers 
in the fiscal year ended may   of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting while the remaining of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers 
for financial statement presentation purposes  the company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
income taxes the provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets relate principally to asset valuation allowances such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty reserves  accrued vacation  accrued commissions and others 
the deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between financial statement and tax depreciation 
deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible 
the company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized 
a valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance 
in future years the company will need to generate approximately million of taxable income in order to realize our deferred tax assets recorded as of may  of  this deferred tax asset balance is only  lower than at the end of the prior year 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if the company adjusts these assumptions  the company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities  which could impact its effective tax rate 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company estimates 
the company practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income expense and to recognize penalties in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company and its subsidiary file consolidated federal and state income tax returns 
as of may   the company had state investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately  expiring through may results of operations a summary of the period to period changes in the principal items included in the consolidated statements of income is shown below summary comparison of the years ended may  and increase decrease sales  net cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses other income expense provision for income taxes net income for the year ended may  all figures being discussed are for the year ended may  as compared to the year ended may  year ended change may  may  increase decrease percent change net revenue cost of sales gross profit 
as a percentage of net revenues the company consolidated results of operations showed a increase in net revenues and a decrease in net income of 
gross profit decreased by 
revenues recorded in the current period for long term construction projects increased by from the level recorded in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to more projects in process in the current year in fiscal  in fiscal 
of the projects in process during this year  were still in process at compared with the prior year when of the projects worked on were still in process at the average value of these projects in process at the end of the two fiscal years remained constant at slightly more than  but the projects in the current year are complete in the aggregate as compared with for those in process at revenues recorded for all other product sales increased by from last year 
the gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the current and prior year periods was and  respectively 
this fluctuation is attributable primarily to a 
three large export projects in the prior year period had higher than average margins  b 
three large projects in the prior year with aerospace defense customers that had higher margins than average projects for construction customers  and c 
in the current period  there were more projects sold directly to representatives in two different asian countries  without commissions to intermediaries  which resulted in lower sales  gross margins and commission expense 
the mix of customers buying our products changed from last year 
sales of the company products are made to three general groups of customers industrial  construction and aerospace defense 
a decrease in sales to aerospace defense customers from last year record high level was more than offset by a increase in sales to customers who were seeking seismic wind protection for either building new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges 
a breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers is as follows industrial construction aerospace defense at may   we had open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of million 
at may   we had slightly more open sales orders in our backlog orders and the total sales value is million 
million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress 
million of the million sales order backlog at may  was in progress at that date 
of the sales value in the backlog is for aerospace defense customers compared to at the end of fiscal as a percentage of the total sales order backlog  orders from customers in construction accounted for at may  and at may  the company backlog  revenues  commission expense  gross margins  gross profits  and net income fluctuate from period to period 
the changes in the current period  compared to the prior period  are not necessarily representative of future results 
net revenue by geographic region  as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended may  and is as follows north america asia other selling  general and administrative expenses year ended change may  may  increase decrease percent change outside commissions other sg a total sg a 
as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by from the prior year 
outside commission expense increased slightly from last year level 
other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by from last year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in employee compensation expense related to the previousyear higher net income compared to the current year as well as the previous year increased professional feesrelated to a study completed to support federal research tax credits 
the above factors resulted in operating income of  for the year ended may   down from the  in the prior year 
net interest income of  in the current year is compared to net interest expense last year of  cash flow from the company operations during the prior year provided sufficient funds to eliminate all of the long term bank debt and short term borrowings as of the end of may  the average level of use of the company operating line of credit reduced from million last year to no usage this year 
available funds are deposited into short term interest bearing bank accounts 
the line of credit is used primarily to fund the production of larger projects that do not allow for advance payments or progress payments 
the company effective tax rate etr is calculated based upon current assumptions relating to the year operating results and various tax related items 
the etr for the fiscal year ended may  is  significantly more than the etr for the prior year of 
a reconciliation of provision for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the company effective rate is as follows computed tax provision at the expected statutory rate state income tax net of federal tax benefit tax effect of permanent differences research tax credits other permanent differences other stock options the company has a stock option plan which provides for the granting of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers  key employees and non employee directors 
options granted under the plan are exercisable over a ten year term 
options not exercised by the end of the term expire 
the company measures compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes such cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company recognized  and  of compensation cost for the years ended may  and the fair value of each stock option grant has been determined using the black scholes model 
the model considers assumptions related to exercise price  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and the weighted average expected term of the stock option grants 
the company used a weighted average expected term 
expected volatility assumptions utilized in the model were based on volatility of the company stock price for the thirty month period immediately preceding the granting of the options 
the company issued stock options in august and april the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield 
the following assumptions were used in the black scholes model in estimating the fair market value of the company stock option grants august april risk free interest rate expected life of the options years years expected share price volatility expected dividends zero zero these assumptions resulted in estimated fair market value per stock option the ultimate value of the options will depend on the future price of the company common stock  which cannot be forecast with reasonable accuracy 
a summary of changes in the stock options outstanding during the year ended may  is presented below weighted number of average options exercise price options outstanding and exercisable at may  options granted less options exercised  options outstanding and exercisable at may  capital resources  line of credit and long term debt the company primary liquidity is dependent upon its working capital needs 
these are primarily inventory  accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  accounts payable  accrued commissions  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  and debt service 
the company primary sources of liquidity have been operations and bank financing 
capital expenditures for the year ended may  were  compared to  in the prior year 
the company has a commitment to make a capital expenditure of  as of may  in august  the company replaced its previous bank credit facility with a  demand line of credit from a different bank  with interest payable at the company option of   or day libor rate plus or the bank prime rate less 
there is an interest rate floor of 
the line is secured by accounts receivable  equipment  inventory  and general intangibles  and a negative pledge of the company real property 
this line of credit is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the bank and is subject to renewal annually 
in conjunction with this line of credit  the company agreed to the following covenants maintain a minimum working capital position of million at all times  actual working capital at may  was million 
maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of actual ratio at may  was the line of credit was unused as of may   as well as of may  the outstanding balance on the line of credit fluctuates as the company various long term projects progress 
the bank is not committed to make loans under this line of credit and no commitment fee is charged 
the company believes that cash on hand should be sufficient to fund its proposed expansion plans described in item of this report 
inventory and maintenance inventory may  may  increase decrease raw materials work in process finished goods inventory maintenance and other inventory total inventory turnover inventory  at  as of may   is lower than the prior year end 
of this  approximately is work in process  is finished goods  and is raw materials 
while the level of inventory will fluctuate from time to time due to the stage of completion of the non project sales orders in progress at the time  we do not expect that the inventory level will increase or decrease significantly from current levels for a sustained period of time 
the company continues to rework slow moving inventory  where applicable  to convert it to product to be used on customer orders 
there was an insignificant amount of slow moving inventory used during the year ended may  the company disposed of approximately  and  of obsolete inventory during the years ended may  and  respectively 
accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings cieb  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings biec may  may  increase decrease accounts receivable cieb less biec net number of an average day sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso the company combines the totals of accounts receivable  the asset cieb  and the liability biec  to determine how much cash the company will eventually realize from revenue recorded to date 
as the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two figures  the company can anticipate increased cash receipts within the ensuing days 
accounts receivable of  as of may  includes approximately  of amounts retained by customers on long term construction projects 
the company expects to collect all of these amounts  including the retainage  during the next twelve months 
the number of an average day sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso decreased from days at may  to days at may  the dso is a function of the level of sales for an average day for example  total sales for the past three months divided by days and the level of accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
the level of sales for an average day in the fourth quarter of the current year is higher than in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
this is consistent with the overall increase in revenue for the quarter from  last year to  this year 
the level of accounts receivable at the end of the current year is lower than at the end of the prior year 
the combination of these two factors caused the dso to decrease from last year end to this 
as noted above cieb represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
whenever possible  the company negotiates a provision in sales contracts to allow the company to bill  and collect from the customer  payments in advance of shipments 
unfortunately  provisions such as this are often not possible 
the  balance in this account at may  is a increase from the prior year end 
this increase from last year end is a reflection of the increase in the number of projects in progress at the two balance sheet dates at may  compared to at may  and in the aggregate  the projects in progress at may  are complete at that date while the projects in progress at may  were complete at that date 
the average total sales value of long term construction projects in process at the end of this year is very similar to the comparable figure at the end of last year 
generally  if progress billings are permitted under the terms of a project sales agreement  then the more complete the project is  the more progress billings will be permitted 
the company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months 
of the cieb balance as of the end of the last fiscal quarter  february   was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended may  the remainder will be billed as the projects progress  in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts 
as of may   there are sales orders for eleven projects that are not yet in progress 
these projects average  each in value upon completion 
this compares to six such projects as of the prior year end with an average value of  the year end balances in the cieb account are comprised of the following components may  may  costs estimated earnings less billings to customers cieb number of projects in progress as noted above  biec represents billings to customers in excess of revenues recognized 
the  balance in this account at may  is in comparison to a  balance at the end of the prior year 
the balance in this account fluctuates in the same manner and for the same reasons as the account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  discussed above 
final delivery of product under these contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months 
the year end balances in this account are comprised of the following components may  may  billings to customers less costs less estimated earnings biec number of projects in progress summary of factors affecting the year end balances in the asset cieb  and the liability biec number of projects in progress at year end aggregate percent complete at year end average total value of projects in progress at year end percentage of total value invoiced to customer the company backlog of sales orders at may  is million  up from the backlog at the end of the prior year of million 
million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress 
accounts payable  at  as of may   is  more than the prior year end 
there is no specific reason for this fluctuation other than the normal payment cycle of vendor invoices 
commission expense on applicable sales orders is recognized at the time revenue is recognized 
the commission is paid following receipt of payment from the customers 
accrued commissions as of may  are  this is more than the  accrued at the prior year end 
commission expense related to long term construction projects is recorded at the same time as revenue on the projects is recorded 
this liability will not decrease until progress billings on the projects have been issued by the company and are paid by our customers 
considering that the net change in the balances of accounts receivable and cieb is an increase of  or over the prior year end  it would be reasonable to expect that the balance in the accrued commissions would likewise be higher than the prior year 
the company expects the current accrued amount to be paid during the next twelve months 
other current liabilities of  decreased only from the prior year of  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the accrued compensation to employees for services 
management believes that the company cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations  capital improvements and share repurchases if any for the next twelve months
