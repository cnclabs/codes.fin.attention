our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
our company we are one of the world largest and oldest lessors of intermodal containers and chassis 
intermodal containers are large  standardized steel boxes used to transport freight by ship  rail or truck 
because of the handling efficiencies they provide  intermodal containers are the primary means by which many goods and materials are shipped internationally 
chassis are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
we operate our business in one industry  intermodal transportation equipment  and have two business segments equipment leasing we own  lease and ultimately dispose of containers and chassis from our lease fleet  as well as manage containers owned by third parties 
equipment trading we purchase containers from shipping line customers  and other sellers of containers  and resell these containers to container traders and users of containers for storage or one way shipment 
operations our consolidated operations include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of multiple types of intermodal containers and chassis 
as of december   our total fleet consisted of  containers and chassis  including  containers under management for third parties  representing  twenty foot equivalent units teu 
we have an extensive global presence  offering leasing services through offices in countries and third party container depot facilities in countries as of december  our customers are among the world largest shipping lines and include  among others  apl nol  cma cgm  maersk line  mediterranean shipping company and nyk line 
for the year ended december   our twenty largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  our five largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  and our largest customer accounted for of our leasing revenues

we also lease chassis  which are used for the transportation of containers domestically  and tank containers  which are used to transport bulk liquid products such as chemicals 
our in house equipment sales group manages the sale process for our used containers and chassis from our equipment leasing fleet and buys and sells used and new containers and chassis acquired from third parties 

table of contents as of december   the percentages of our equipment fleet and leasing revenues by equipment type are as follows equipment type percent of total fleet units percent of leasing revenue dry refrigerated special chassis tank equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  finance leases and service leases 
long term leases  typically with initial contractual terms ranging from three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
we also have expired long term leases whose fixed terms have ended but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments pursuant to the terms of the initial contract 
some leases have contractual terms that have features reflective of both long term and service leases and we classify such leases as either long term or service leases  depending upon which features we believe are more predominant 
the following table provides a summary of our equipment leasing fleet portfolio by lease type  based on total on hire units as of the dates indicated below lease portfolio december  december  december  long term leases finance leases service leases expired long term leases units on hire total as of december   our long term leases had an average remaining contract term of approximately months  assuming no leases are renewed 
operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gain or loss that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 
our leasing revenues are primarily driven by our owned fleet size  utilization and average rental rates 
our leasing revenues also include ancillary fees driven by drop off volumes 
during  our leasing revenue increased rapidly over the course of the year 
leasing revenues for the full year of 
table of contents increased from the level to reach million  but the year to year comparison does not fully reflect the rate at which leasing revenues increased during our leasing revenues decreased throughout as lower trade volumes associated with the financial crisis limited our investment in new units and pressured our utilization and average rental rates 
during  trade volumes rapidly recovered to pre crisis levels  allowing us to make large investments in our fleet and helping us drive a rapid recovery in our utilization and average rental rates 
during  our leasing revenue increased from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
owned fleet size 
as of december   our owned fleet included  teus  an increase of from december  the increase in fleet size during was due to several factors  including large purchases of new containers and the completion of several sale leaseback transactions for trading containers 
tal increased new container purchases in due to a strong recovery in demand for leased containers 
trade volumes were exceptionally weak from the end of through the middle of  leading to a decrease in demand for containers and a build up of excess container inventories 
in response to this  leasing companies and shipping lines effectively ceased purchasing containers in  and we estimate that global container capacity decreased five percent or more from september through the end of as containers aged out of service and were not replaced 
however  trade volumes began to recover in the second half of  and by the summer of had reached or surpassed peak levels on most trade routes 
in  this combination of decreased container capacity and recovering trade volumes led to a global shortage of containers  strong leasing demand and rapidly increasing utilization for tal 
in response to the strong leasing demand in  tal purchased over million of new equipment  including over  teu of dry containers and approximately  teu of refrigerated containers 
tal purchases of new containers in have also been supported by a shift in the mix of shipping line owned versus leased containers 
historically  shipping lines have purchased and owned to of the containers they operate  and leased to of their operated containers from leasing companies like tal 
however  most shipping lines were cautious about committing to large purchases of new containers during despite the global container shortage 
many shipping lines continue to face financial constraints due to lingering effects of the financial crisis and increased capital outlays associated with their aggressive ship building programs  and in they relied more heavily on the leasing market for access to additional container capacity 
this trend has continued into the early part of and as of the end of january  tal has ordered over million of new equipment  including over  teu of new dry containers and approximately  teu of new refrigerated containers for delivery in the first half of utilization 
our average utilization was in the year ended december   an increase of from the year ended december  ending utilization increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase in our utilization during was mainly the result of the rapid increase in trade volumes during the first half of the year and constrained new container production capacity 
while tal purchased a record number of new containers in  overall container production for the market was fairly low as the container manufacturers needed to ramp up production after effectively closing their factories in this combination of strong containerized trade volumes and constrained new container production capacity led to exceptionally strong leasing demand and a rapid increase in our utilization 
the global container shortage also led to a significant decrease in container drop off volumes from our customers  which caused our inventory of old containers available for sale to decrease throughout the year 
while global containerized trade volumes have decreased seasonally from the third quarter of  our utilization has remained strong into the first part of as shipping lines have generally preferred to retain leased containers on hire to help ease the shortages they faced during the peak 
table of contents season in and to continue to enjoy historical leasing rates that in many cases are well below current market levels 
utilization and leasing demand for our refrigerated containers remained solid in the utilization of our refrigerated containers does not heavily influence our overall utilization since they represent only of the units in our fleet 
however  these container types are significantly more expensive than dry containers  generate higher per diem lease rates and currently represent approximately of our leasing revenue 
leasing demand for special containers remained steady while utilization for our chassis product line improved due to increased leasing demand driven by a rebound in the container volumes coming into the united states 
the following tables set forth our equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below average utilization year ended december  quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  ending utilization december  september  june  march  utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease by the total units in our fleet excluding new units not yet leased 
average rental rates 
our average rental rates increased steadily throughout after decreasing during in  our average dry container rental rates decreased over the course of the year  primarily due to lease incentives provided to certain customers in order to encourage them to pick up containers and extend containers on lease during the difficult economic and trade environment 
our market environment changed dramatically in  and our average dry container lease rates increased from their level as of the end of as some of the incentive deals expired and as we placed new containers purchased in onto leases with rates much higher than our portfolio average 
lease rates for new dry containers in have been supported by strong leasing demand and very high prices for new containers 
new dry container prices increased over during due to increasing steel prices  the strong demand for containers and container production capacity constraints 
new dry container prices and market leasing rates have remained historically high into the first part of  and we expect our average dry container lease rates to continue to trend upward during unless new container prices fall significantly from their current level 
in  average lease rates for refrigerated and special containers over the course of the year were lower and higher  respectively  compared to the decrease in average lease rates for our refrigerated containers was primarily due to lease rate concessions provided to certain customers in for lease extension transactions 
in addition  market leasing rates for new refrigerated containers remain slightly below our portfolio average rates due to a decrease in the price of new refrigerated containers over the last several years 
the increase in average lease rates for our special containers was due to the placement of new special containers purchased in onto leases with rates higher than our portfolio average  combined with the expiration of a lease contract at rates lower than our portfolio average 
fee and ancillary revenue 
fee and ancillary revenue decreased million  or in compared to  and this decrease partially offset the growth in our leasing revenue from our larger owned fleet size  increase in utilization and increase in average dry container lease rates 
most of our 
table of contents fee and ancillary revenue  including repair charges  handling fees and logistical fees  are related to container drop offs 
due to the global shortage of dry containers  the volume of container drop offs was exceptionally low during we expect our drop off volumes and fee and ancillary revenue to increase when the supply and demand balance for dry containers returns to a more normal situation 
equipment disposals 
during  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to a million gain in the increase compared to mainly resulted from higher selling prices 
selling prices for used dry containers in have increased or more from the beginning of the year due to the shortage of global container capacity  which has led to a significant decrease in the numbers of older containers being made available for disposal 
increased trade volumes have also led to an increase in demand for used containers for one way shipments to locations with high back haul costs 
in  we sold approximately  teus of our owned containers  or of our owned equipment leasing fleet as of the beginning of the year 
this annual disposal rate is in line with the to annual disposal rate we have been experiencing for the last several years  and is generally consistent with our expected long term average disposal rate given the year expected useful life of our containers 
however  our inventory of disposal containers was exceptionally low at the end of and container drop off volumes have remained low into the first part of as a result  our disposal volume in will be constrained until container drop offs return to a normal level 
equipment trading 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net equipment trading margin of million on the sale of equipment purchased for resale  compared to a million margin in in  our trading margins decreased from the high levels achieved in previous years as we decreased our purchase volumes due to concerns about future selling prices  and as we experienced low per unit margins from selling containers that had been purchased in prior years at relatively high prices 
in  our per unit trading margins have improved due to an increase in used container selling prices  though overall trading margins were constrained in due to low trading volumes 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started to significantly increase our purchases of trading containers  and our equipment trading inventory increased to  teu as of december  compared to  teu as of december  however  most of these trading containers were purchased through sale leaseback transactions with our shipping line customers  and container drop offs under these deals have been slow due to the worldwide shortage of containers 
equipment ownership expenses 
our ownership expenses  principally depreciation and interest expense  increased by million  or in as compared to during  tal purchased a large volume of new containers and as a result  the net book value of our revenue earning assets increased by over during the year 
however  the average net book value of our revenue earning assets increased only in compared to the change in the average net book value of our equipment from to was significantly less than the change in ending net book value since the book value of our equipment fleet decreased over the course of and since many of the containers purchased in were delivered in the second half of the year 
interest expense increased million or in  due to an increase in our average outstanding debt and an increase in our average effective interest rate 
our average debt balance increased in  slightly lower than the growth in our average revenue earning asset since we typically pay for our equipment several months after it is delivered 
however  our debt balance as of december  was higher than it was at the beginning of the year due to the large payments made for equipment in the second half of the year  and accordingly we expect our average debt balance and annual interest expense to be significantly higher in than it was in in  our average effective interest rate increased from in to in  since the debt incurred in to finance new equipment purchases generally included larger financing spreads than those on our debt facilities arranged in prior years 
this increase in financing spreads was partially offset by the early termination of interest rate swap contracts in the fourth quarter 
we terminated swaps with a notional value of million that were due to expire in and and partially replaced them with longer dated swaps reflective of lower market interest rates 

table of contents depreciation expense increased only million in despite our large equipment investments 
new investments  net of disposals  in led to million of incremental depreciation expense in  but this increase was offset by a million reduction in depreciation expense due to another vintage year of containers becoming fully depreciated at the end of and a million reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in residual value estimates that went into effect on october  after conducting our annual review of our historical disposal experience  we decided to increase the estimated residual values used in our equipment depreciation policy 
we have experienced a number of years of consistently high disposal gains  including during the difficult market of  and based on this review we have reset the estimated residual values for a number of our major container types to be more reflective of values we have realized for this equipment over the last several years 
tal previous residual value estimates were established in  after several years of exceptionally weak disposal markets 
disposal prices were very low from through due to very low new container prices and an accumulation of a large volume of older containers in north america and europe in the aftermath of the asia crisis 
since  disposal prices have remained in excess of our residual estimates and the current adjustment to the estimates reflect this recent favorable experience 
over time  the higher residual estimates will lead to a decrease in our disposal gains that should offset much of the decrease in our depreciation expense 
however  for the next several years  we do not expect the change in residual estimates to have a meaningful impact on our disposal gains since a large number of the containers we expect to sell over the next few years have already been depreciated to prior residual values 
as a result  for the next several years  we expect the change in our residual value estimates to lead to an increase in our profitability compared to what we would have achieved with our previous residual estimates 
credit performance 
our credit performance remained strong in  and we recorded a reversal of million for credit provisions taken in prior years that were not needed 
the financial performance of the shipping industry has improved significantly  and most shipping lines were highly profitable in after generating large losses in however there is concern that our customers may again face pressure from falling freight rates in if trade growth falls short of the projected growth in vessel capacity 
in addition  several major shipping lines  including one of our largest customers  continue to be involved in comprehensive financial restructuring negotiations with their major creditors 
as a result  the potential for credit losses remains and we will continue to be vigilant with our credit and collection processes 
operating expenses 
our direct operating expenses were million in  compared to million in we incurred significantly less repair and storage costs in due to less redeliveries and fewer idle containers during the period 
our administrative expenses increased million in due to higher incentive compensation expense associated with tal improved financial performance in  partially offset by lower salaries and fringe benefits associated with certain employee terminations during

these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in selling costs and administrative expenses related to the decrease in the volume of units sold 
equipment trading income before income taxes 
income before income taxes for the equipment trading segment was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  which was primarily due to the equipment trading margin decrease of million 
the decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to lower allocated corporate expenses 
corporate expenses are allocated to the equipment trading segment primarily based on the volume of units sold in the equipment trading fleet relative to total units sold from both the equipment trading and equipment leasing fleets 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of our leasing equipment  principal payments on finance lease receivables and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our cash in flows and borrowings are used to finance capital expenditures  meet debt service requirements  and pay dividends 

table of contents we continue to have sizable cash in flows

this was followed in  when our indirect wholly owned subsidiary tal advantage iv llc issued the series and series fixed rate secured notes 
the facilities are designed to reduce borrowing costs and enhance financing resources for our container fleet 
under the facilities  our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries issue asset backed notes 
the issuance of asset backed notes is the primary business objective of those subsidiaries 
our borrowings under the abs facilities amortize in equal monthly installments 
the borrowing capacity under the abs facilities is determined by applying an advance rate against the sum of the net book values of designated eligible containers and accounts receivable for sold containers not aged more than days plus of restricted cash

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not reasonably assured is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification no 
revenue recognition asc  we recognize billings to customers for damages and certain other operating costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
as principal  we are responsible for fulfillment of the services  supplier selection and service specifications  and we have ultimate responsibility to pay the supplier for the services whether or not we collect the amount billed to the lessee 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option that enables the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenues and expense equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of equipment purchased for resale and are recognized as units are sold and delivered to the customer 
the related expenses 
table of contents represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management fee income we manage equipment which is owned by third parties and we earn management fees based on the income earned by the leasing and sales of such equipment 
management fees are recognized as services are provided 
we collect amounts billed and pay operating costs as agent on behalf of the third parties that own such equipment 
these billings and operating costs are not included in revenue and expense  instead  the net amounts owed to these equipment owners are reflected as accrued expenses in our financial statements until paid as required by our contracts 
other revenues other revenues include fee income for third party positioning of equipment 
leasing equipment in general  the company purchases new equipment from equipment manufacturers for the purpose of leasing such equipment to customers 
occasionally  the company may also purchase used equipment with the intention of selling such equipment 
used units are typically purchased with an existing lease in place or were previously owned by one of the company third party owner investors 
leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the company reviews its depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in its depreciation policies  useful lives of its equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
we conducted a review of our historical disposal experience and have reset the estimated residual values for a number of our major container types to be more reflective of values we have realized for this equipment over the last several years 
the estimated useful lives of all leasing equipment remain the same 
effective october   the estimated useful lives and residual values for the company leasing equipment from the date of manufacture are as follows useful lives years residual values dry container units to  refrigerated container units  to  special container units to  tank container units chassis prior to october   the company estimated residual value ranges of dry  refrigerated and special containers were to   to  and to  respectively 
costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
the company charges to expense inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and include these costs in direct operating expenses 
if indicators of impairment are present  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of the company fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
leasing equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recovered 
key indicators of impairment on leasing equipment include  among other 
table of contents factors  a sustained decrease in operating profitability  a sustained decrease in utilization  or indications of technological obsolescence 
when testing for impairment  leasing equipment is generally grouped by equipment type  and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities 
some of the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine future undiscounted cash flows and the measurement for impairment are the remaining useful life  expected utilization  expected future lease rates  and expected disposal prices of the equipment 
the company considers the assumptions on expected utilization and the remaining useful life to have the greatest impact on our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
these estimates are principally based on the company historical experience and management judgment of market conditions 
an allowance is provided through provision for doubtful accounts based on the net book value of a percentage of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing which the company believes it will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on historical experience 
equipment held for sale when leasing equipment is returned off lease  we make a determination of whether to repair and re lease the equipment or sell the equipment 
at the time we determine that equipment will be sold  we reclassify the appropriate amounts previously recorded as leasing equipment to equipment held for sale 
in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
property  plant and equipment asc  equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its estimated fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell  or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within days 
subsequent changes to the asset fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments may not exceed the equipment carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net gain loss on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a gain loss on sale of leasing equipment  and cash flows associated with the disposal of equipment held for sale are classified as cash flows from investing activities 
equipment held for resale trading activity on an opportunistic basis  we purchase used equipment with markings or specifications different from our own equipment for purposes of reselling it within a short time frame for a net profit 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as equipment held for sale due to the short timeframe  generally less than one year  between the time the equipment is purchased and the time the equipment is sold 
due to this short expected holding period  cash flows associated with equipment held for resale are classified as operating cash flows 
equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of this equipment  while equipment trading expense includes the cost of equipment sold  any costs to sell such equipment  including administrative costs  and costs associated with the inventory such as storage and handling charges 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectability of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if applicable  we accrue income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions by evaluating whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit and then measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc 
asc requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
in connection with the acquisition that occurred in  we recorded million of goodwill 
management determined that the company has two reporting units  equipment leasing and equipment trading  and allocated million and million  respectively  to each reporting unit 
the annual impairment test is conducted by comparing the company carrying amount  to the fair value of the company using a market capitalization approach 
market capitalization of the entity is compared to the carrying value of the entity since virtually all of the goodwill is allocated to  and nearly all of the market capitalization is attributable to  the equipment leasing reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the entity exceeds its market capitalization  then a second step would be performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any excess fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our annual review of goodwill  conducted in the fourth quarter of  indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative diclosures about market risk interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is in derivative asset positions counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with highly rated financial institutions 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current exposures and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   we had in place total interest rate swap contracts to fix the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under our debt facilities as summarized below total notional amount at december  weighted average fixed leg interest rate at december  weighted average remaining term million years these interest rate swap contracts are not designated as hedging instruments  and the change in their fair values will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as net gains or losses on interest rate swaps 
since approximately of our variable rate debt is hedged using interest rate swaps  our interest expense is not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
however  our earnings are impacted by changes in interest rate swap valuations which cause gains or losses to be recorded 
during the year ended december   net losses on interest rate swaps totaled million  compared to net gains on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december  during  we terminated an interest rate swap contract that had been designated as a cash flow hedge 
therefore  the cumulative losses on the swap as of the date of termination were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the original term of the interest rate swap contract 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss income attributable to this swap would be recognized in earnings immediately in conjunction with the termination of the related debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the large majority of our leases and company obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in and were denominated in us dollars 
however we pay our non us staff in local currencies  and our direct operating expenses and disposal transactions for our older containers are often structured in foreign currencies 
we recorded unrealized foreign currency exchange losses of million and million for the in the years ended december  and  which resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates related to our euro and pound sterling transactions and related assets 

table of contents in april  we entered into a foreign currency rate swap agreement to exchange euros for us dollars based on expected payments under its euro denominated finance lease receivables 
the foreign currency rate swap agreement expires in april the fair value of this derivative contract was approximately million at december   and is reported as an asset in fair value of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet
