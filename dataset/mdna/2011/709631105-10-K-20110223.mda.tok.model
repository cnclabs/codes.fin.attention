overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets  designing and manufacturing standard  modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them 
in  our water group and technical products group accounted for approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size 
our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
on june   we entered into a transaction with ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an percent ownership interest in ge s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business 
the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities  collectively  pentair residential filtration or prf a us entity and an international entity  into which we and ge contributed certain assets  properties  liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses 
we are an percent owner of the new entities and ge is a percent owner 
with the formation of pentair residential filtration  we believe we are better positioned to serve residential customers with industry leading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning  whole house and point of use filtration 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as data communications  industrial  infrastructure and energy 
we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america 
key trends and uncertainties our sales revenue for the full year of was approximately billion  increasing from sales in the prior year 
our water group sales increased in the year to approximately billion  compared to the same period in our technical products group sales increased to approximately billion as compared to the same period in 
table of contents the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in the future most markets we serve slowed dramatically in late and throughout as a result of the global recession 
in  most markets showed signs of improvement 
because our businesses are significantly affected by general economic trends  further deterioration in our most important markets addressed below would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation for and beyond 
we have also identified specific market opportunities that we have been and are pursuing that we find attractive  both within and outside the united states 
we are reinforcing our businesses to more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources 
unless we successfully penetrate these product and geographic markets  our organic growth will be limited 
after four years of new home building and new pool start contraction in the united states  these end markets stabilized in overall  we believe approximately of pentair sales are used in global residential applications for replacement and refurbishment  remodeling and repair and new construction 
we expect this stabilization  along with new product introductions and expanded distribution and channel penetration  to result in volume increases in we believe that housing construction will modestly improve in  which we expect will have a favorable impact on these businesses  but our participation in this trend historically has lagged approximately six months from inception 
industrial  communications and commercial markets for all of our businesses  including commercial and industrial construction  also slowed significantly in order rates and sales improved in our industrial and communications businesses in as business spending returned  while non residential construction markets still declined 
we believe that the outlook for most of these markets is mixed and we currently expect that non residential construction declines will moderate to approximately down year over year in  compared to a decline of approximately in through  we experienced material and other cost inflation 
we strive for productivity improvements  and we implement increases in selling prices to mitigate this inflation 
we expect the current economic environment will result in continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials 
we believe that the impact of higher commodity prices will continue to impact us in  but we are uncertain on the timing and impact of this cost inflation 
despite higher interest expense and lower discount rates  our unfunded pension liabilities declined to approximately million as of the end of due to investment performance and plan contributions 
the contributions included accelerated contributions of million in december and  respectively  to improve plan balances and reduce future contributions 
we anticipate that our pension expense will increase over levels 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds percent of our net income 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
free cash flow for the full year was approximately million  or of our net income  which included an accelerated contribution to our pension plan of million in december we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income from continuing operations in we are continuing to target reductions in working capital and particularly inventory  as a percentage of sales 
see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources in this report for a reconciliation of our free cash flow 
in  our operating objectives include the following increasing our presence in fast growth regions and vertical market focus to grow in those markets in which we have competitive advantages  leveraging our technological capabilities to increasingly generate innovative new products  
table of contents driving operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives  with specific focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management and lean operations  and focusing on proactive talent development  particularly in international management and other key functional areas 
we may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic reach internationally  expanding our presence in our various channels to market and acquiring technologies and products to broaden our businesses capabilities to serve additional markets though acquisitions 
we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally fund cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  equity investments  acquisitions  debt repayments  dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations  availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances  public and private debt and equity offerings 
we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time  by private or public debt issuance 
our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes  although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions  these are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within less than a year 
we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt  while continuing to fund our research and development  marketing and capital investment initiatives 
our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 
our current million multi currency revolving credit facility the credit facility expires on june  the agent banks under the credit facility are jp morgan  bank of america  wells fargo  us bank and bank of tokyo mitsubishi 
we believe we have ample borrowing capacity for our currently projected operating needs 
our availability under the credit facility was million at december   which was not limited by any of the credit agreement s financial covenants as of that date 
we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes  which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks 
end user demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august 
the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns  particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in or million higher than in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to higher income from continuing operations offset by increased working capital necessary to support revenue growth 
cash provided by operating activities was million in or million higher than in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in working capital  offset by an accelerated pension contribution of million and lower income from continuing operations 
in december  we sold approximately million of a customer s account receivable to a third party financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk 
sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in we incurred a loss in the amount of million related to the sale of accounts receivable which is included in the line item other in our consolidated statements of income 
we did not undertake a similar sale of customer receivables in or investing activities capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately to million  primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities  new product development and general maintenance capital 
on december   we sold our spa and bath spa bath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction for million 
the results of spa bath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents on february   we sold our national pool tile npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction for million 
the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in and million in was primarily related to various asset dispositions 
cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in was primarily related to the sale of a facility in our water group 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities was in  million in and in the decrease primarily relates to fluctuations in liquidity 
financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business  payments of dividends  cash received used for stock issued to employees  repurchase of common stock and tax benefits related to stock based compensation 
the credit facility creates an unsecured  committed revolving credit facility of up to million  with multi currency sub facilities to support investments outside the us borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 
interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 
we believe that internally generated funds and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our normal operations  dividend payments  stock repurchases and debt maturities over the life of the credit facility 
we are authorized to sell short term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility 
we use the credit facility as back up liquidity to support of commercial paper outstanding 
our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our credit facility 
as of december  and we had no outstanding commercial paper 
our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants  the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio total consolidated indebtedness  as defined  over consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined that may not exceed to we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december  in addition to the credit facility  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities  under which we had million of borrowings as of december  our current credit ratings are as follows long term debt current rating rating agency rating outlook standard poor s bbb stable moody s baa stable our long term debt rating is an investment grade rating 
investment grade is a credit rating of bbb or higher by standard poor s or baa or higher by moody s 
on march   standard poor s s p affirmed our bbb rating with a stable outlook 
on april   moody s affirmed our baa rating and changed our current rating outlook from negative to stable 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 

table of contents we issue short term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually 
we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements  by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
we paid dividends in of million  compared with million in and million in we recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for from per share in to per share in  which is the th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend

the estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance with the pension protection act of pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from to 
in december and we made accelerated contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plan 

table of contents the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december  is estimated to be approximately million 
we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and interest expense  respectively  which is consistent with our past practices 
as of december   we had recorded approximately million for the possible payment of penalties and million related to the possible payment of interest 
other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of net income from continuing operations 
free cash flow is a non generally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance 
we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends  make acquisitions  repay debt and repurchase shares 
in addition  free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation based incentives 
our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow twelve months ended december in thousands net cash provided by used for continuing operations capital expenditures proceeds from sale of property and equipment free cash flow off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets or prp in a small number of environmental clean ups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in clean up costs  fines  penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  the disposition of lincoln industrial in and the disposition of the tools group in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
we settled some of the claims in prior years  to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 
in addition  there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
as of december  and  our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately million and million  respectively 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

table of contents stand by letters of credit and bonds in the ordinary course of business  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog 
in addition  we issue financial stand by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs and certain legal matters 
as of december  and  the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million and million  respectively
