item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
except for historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of overview we are a leading fabless provider of highly integrated system on chip  or soc  solutions that are used to deliver multimedia entertainment throughout the home 
we offer four separate product lines media processors  home networking products  video image processors and home control and energy management automation products 
each of these product lines contributes to our fully integrated soc offerings 
we sell our products into four primary target markets the iptv media processor  connected home  connected media player and prosumer and industrial audio video markets 
we also sell a small amount of our products into other markets  such as the high definition television  or hdtv  and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
iptv media processor market the iptv media processor market consists of consumer and commercial products  primarily set top boxes  which receive and distribute streaming video and audio using ip 
we serve this market primarily with our media processor product line 
we believe we are the leading provider of high definition digital media processor socs for set top boxes in the iptv media processor market in terms of units shipped

iptv set top boxes incorporating our chipsets are deployed by telecommunications carriers globally including carriers in asia  europe and north america such as at t  duetsche telecom  ntt and sfr 
we work with these carriers and set top box providers as well as with systems software providers  such as microsoft and various android and linux providers  to design solutions that address the carriers specific requirements regarding features and performance 
in connection with our efforts to expand our iptv media processor market  we have development projects underway to address the hybrid set top box opportunities that result from combining iptv with cable and terrestrial broadcast reception 
connected home market the connected home market consists of communication devices that use a standard protocol to connect equipment inside the home and stream ip based video and audio  voice over ip  or voip  or data through wired or wireless connectivity 
we target the connected home market with our wired and wireless home networking and home control and energy management automation products 
our wired networking products use three technologies  hpna  hpav and g 
hn 
our hpna products are currently used in iptv set top boxes as well as residential gateways  optical network terminals  multi dwelling unit masters and network adapters by leading oems  such as pace  cisco systems and motorola 
set top boxes containing our products are deployed globally  primarily in north america  by telecommunications carriers such as at t  bell aliant  bell canada  century link and telus 
our wireless products use two technologies  z wave and uwb 
our wireless z wave home control and energy management automation products are used in a wide variety of consumer products such as thermostats  light switches and door locks 
these consumer products are designed by leading industry participants such as danfoss  ingersoll rand schlage and trane  leviton and cooper wiring 
our uwb products target high definition audio video  or hdav  speaker and home networking solutions over coaxial cables and wirelessly 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from our products based on hpav and uwb technologies and we have generated no revenue from our recently introduced products based on g 
hn technology 
connected media player market the connected media player market consists primarily of digital media adapters  or dmas  portable media devices  wireless streaming pc or ip to tv devices and blu ray dvd players that perform playback of digital media stored in optical or hard disk formats 
we target this market with our media processor product line 
our media processor socs are used by consumer electronics providers  such as netgear  sony and western digital in applications such as dmas  blu ray dvd players  and other connected media player devices 
prosumer and industrial audio video market the prosumer and industrial audio video market consists of studio quality audio video receivers and monitors  video conferencing  digital projectors and medical video monitors 
we target this market with our vxp video image processor product line 
our vxp video image processor products are one of the leading solutions for studio quality video image processing and are used by leading industry participants such as harris  panasonic  polycom and sony 
our soc solutions our soc solutions consist of highly integrated semiconductors and software that enables real time processing of digital video and audio content  which we refer to as real time software 
as a result  we believe our soc solutions enable our customers to efficiently bring consumer multimedia devices to market 
we believe iptv set top box and connected media player designers and consumer device manufacturers select our soc solutions because of the compelling nature of their performance and ease of integration 
our highly integrated products have replaced a number of single function semiconductors with a multi function soc  which significantly improves performance and lowers power consumption and cost 
we sell our soc solutions into each of our primary target markets 
for fiscal and  we derived nearly and  respectively  of our net revenue from our soc solutions 
characteristics of our business we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and generate substantially all of our net revenue based on customer purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our direct customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory  which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
on occasion  we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our target markets 
the willingness of customers to design our socs into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices and average costs  volume order discounts  mix of product sales  amount of development revenue and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from three principal sources product sales and  to a lesser extent  product development contracts and service contracts 
we recognize revenue for product sales and service contracts when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to oems  distributors and end users is recognized upon shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  and revenue is deferred when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectability is not assured 
when revenue is deferred  it is subsequently recognized when collection becomes probable and returns are estimable 
allowances for sales returns  discounts and warranty costs are recorded at the time that the associated revenue is recognized 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development  or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  developed technology  ipr d and trademarks 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired products  customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and expected cash flows from completed projects  assumptions regarding brand awareness and market position  and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and assumptions about discount rates 
the estimated fair values are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the assets fair value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment annually or if certain impairment indicators are identified 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes  and any operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions  net of any valuation allowance  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are considered more likely than not to be realized 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  asc  income taxes  provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted unit sales by product 
a provision is recorded for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we will write off inventories that are obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the time of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  we will realize higher gross margins for those products 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant utilizing an option pricing model  which is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models have been developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value 
in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  the determined fair value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities primarily include certificates of deposit  corporate commercial paper  corporate bonds  money market funds and us agency discount notes 
short term marketable securities represent highly liquid debt instruments with a remaining maturity date at acquisition date of greater than days but less than one year and are stated at fair value 
long term marketable securities represent securities with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  which is recognized as an adjustment to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
any gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
we monitor all of our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have a decline in fair value  use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
we previously held auction rate securities  or ars 
ars are bought and sold in the market place through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
subsequent to february  all auctions involving the ars that we held failed 
in october  we accepted an offer of a comprehensive settlement agreement from our cash investment advisor  ubs  in which all the ars that we held could be redeemed at par value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  all of the ars that we held were redeemed at par value 
accounts receivable we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot estimate whether collectability is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we also provide allowances for bad debt and sales returns 
in establishing our allowance for bad debt  we review the customer payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing our allowance for sales returns  we make estimates of potential future returns of products for which revenue has been recognized in the current period  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and  we recorded provisions for sales returns  discounts and bad debt in the total amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of operations and sets forth our historical operating results as a percentage of net revenue for each of the fiscal years indicated in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of january  of january  of net revenue net revenue net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net impairment of investment income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenue our net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal this increase in revenue for fiscal was primarily due to a increase in units shipped partially offset by a decrease in asp across all product lines 
the increase in units shipped for fiscal was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products  the majority of which we added to our product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increased shipments of our prosumer and industrial audio video products  or vxp  due to increased orders from our existing customers in the vxp market 
the decline in asp for fiscal was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products 
our net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease in revenue for fiscal was primarily due to a decline in the average selling price of our socs which was partially offset by a increase in soc units shipped 
the decline in average selling prices  or asps  and increase in shipments of socs  was primarily the result of shipments to our larger customers  who achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products as well as shipments of our home networking products  the majority of which we added to our product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products 
net revenue by target market we sell our products into four primary target markets  which are the iptv media processor market  connected home market  the connected media player market and the prosumer and industrial audio video market 
we also sell a small amount of our products into other markets  such as the high definition television  or hdtv  and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
our net revenue from sales into the connected home market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal primarily due to the addition of the product line we acquired through our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth our net revenue by target market and the percentage of net revenue represented by our product sales to each target market in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of january  of january  of net revenue net revenue net revenue iptv media processor connected home connected media player prosumer and industrial audio video other net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
iptv media processor market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our soc solutions  primarily our smp and smp soc series  into the iptv media processor market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable to improved demand in our iptv market that was partially offset by declining average selling prices due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total net revenue decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the increase in net revenue from the connected home market 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our soc solutions  primarily our smp soc series  into the iptv media processor market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decline was attributable to weakness in demand as a result of the general economic downturn and declining average selling prices due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the iptv media processor market as a percentage of our total net revenue decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of these factors and also due to the increase in net revenue for our connected media player and connected home markets 
connected home market prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we referred to the connected home market as the wireless target market 
we believe the connected home market that we currently address with our home networking and home control and energy management automation product lines more accurately describes our target market 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected home market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the same reason  our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected home market increased by as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal we expect revenue from our connected home market to fluctuate in future periods based on changes in asp and inventory levels at contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products for deployment by telecommunication providers  and competitive market pressures 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into our connected home market increased million compared to fiscal this increase was the result of our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal and zensys holdings corporation in december for the same reason  our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected home market increased to in fiscal as a percentage of our total net revenue compared to a minimal percentage in fiscal connected media player market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in asp for sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our socs into digital media adapters as these customers achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by  primarily as a result of the increase in revenue from our connected home market 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our socs into digital media adapters 
for the same reason  our revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal prosumer and industrial audio video market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in units shipped primarily due to strengthening demand from our existing customers and our continued effort to expand into this market 
our revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue increased by for fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market decreased million  or  from fiscal the decline was attributable to an overall slowdown in the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a result of the global economic downturn 
our revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue was unchanged for fiscal compared to fiscal other markets our other markets consist of hdtv  pc add in boards  development contracts  services and other ancillary markets 
for fiscal  net revenue decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower engineering development fees for customization of our socs and a decline in sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our products into hdtvs 
for fiscal  net revenue from this market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower engineering development fees for customization of our socs and a decline in sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our products into hdtvs 
net revenue by product group our primary product group consists of our soc solutions 
to a lesser extent  we derive net revenue from other products and services 
the following table sets forth net revenue in each of our product groups and the percentage of net revenue represented by each product group in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of net january  of net january  of net revenue revenue revenue socs other net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
socs our socs are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume designer and manufacturer customers building products for the iptv media processor  connected home  connected media player and prosumer and industrial audio video markets 
the increase of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a increase in units shipped partially offset by a decrease in asp 
both the increase in units shipped and the decline in asp for fiscal were primarily the result of shipments of home networking products which we added to our product line in the fourth quarters of fiscal as a result of the coppergate acquisition and which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products 
the decrease of million  or  in net revenue from socs for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decline in asp of our socs which was partially offset by a increase in soc units shipped 
the decline in asp was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products which we added to our product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the coppergate acquisition and which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products and the result of shipments of our media processor products to customers  who achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts 
the increase in soc units shipped was primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped for our home networking and home control and energy management automation products as a result of our coppergate and zensys acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  our connected media player products 
other we derive revenue from other products and services  including software development kits  engineering support services for hardware and software  engineering development for customization of socs and other accessories 
the revenue derived from other products and services was not a significant portion of our total net revenue 
net revenue by geographic region prior to the first quarter of fiscal  we reported our net revenue by geographic region based on billing location 
we believe reporting based on ship to location provides more relevant information about our customer base 
our net revenue by geographic region for the comparative periods has been reclassified based on the ship to location of our customers 
the following table sets forth net revenue for each geographic region based on the ship to location of customers in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of january  of january  of net revenue net revenue net revenue asia north america europe other regions net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
asia our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from asia increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue were primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from china which resulted primarily from the increase in shipments of our home connectivity products as a result of our coppergate acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue by country in the asia region  china  including hong kong  represented in fiscal and in fiscal our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from asia increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from customers in taiwan and china which was primarily attributable to customers shifting their production orders from contract manufacturers located in europe to contract manufacturers in those countries 
in addition  in fiscal  net revenue from taiwan increased due to a customer ramping production of their dma product 
this increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was partially offset by a decline in the asps of our socs

our net revenue in absolute dollars from north america decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue from north america decreased as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in our net revenue from north america in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to customers who incorporate our products into their finished goods placing their orders through contract manufacturers located outside of north america 
for fiscal  our net revenue generated outside north america was of our net revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the overall trend has been for companies located in north america who incorporate our products into their finished products to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region 
we expect our revenue from north america in any given year to fluctuate depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their finished products 
europe our net revenue in absolute dollars from europe decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of the decrease in our net revenue from europe in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was attributable to certain european customers moving their production to asia and  to lesser extent  a decline in demand for our products from a customer located in europe

gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  january  january  change change gross profit gross margin our gross profit increased million  and gross margin increased percentage points for fiscal  compared to fiscal these increases were due primarily to a decline in our average cost per soc during fiscal which were partially offset by a decline in our asp per soc 
the decline in our average cost per soc was primarily due to the increase in units shipped for our home connectivity products  which have a lower average cost than our media processor and vxp products  and a million reduction in the mark up on inventories purchased through our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys as the majority of the inventory was sold during fiscal the improvement in our average cost per soc was partially offset by an increase in our operations overhead costs of million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to a million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles primarily as a result of our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in asp was primarily due to the addition of our home connectivity product line which has a lower asp than our media processor product line 
our gross profit decreased million  and gross margin decreased percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were due primarily to a decline in our asp per soc which was partially offset by a decline in our average cost per soc unit 
the decline in asp was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products  which we added to our product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the coppergate acquisition and which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products  and the result of shipments of our media processor products to customers  who achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts 
the decline in our average cost per soc was primarily due to overall cost reductions from our suppliers as well as improved yields on our highest volume products 
this decline in our average cost per soc was partially offset by operations overhead increasing by million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles and a million increase in compensation and benefits costs due to our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys in the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  our gross margin in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal due to an increase of million in connection with mark up on inventories purchased through our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys

the amortization period is based on the expected vesting term of the options 
the increase in stock based compensation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an overall increase in headcount  including personnel added by our acquisition of coppergate in november the decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal for an option granted and fully vested during that period and a million reduction due to a specific option cancellation recorded in the first quarter of fiscal future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with any acquisitions

if we purchase additional intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue or other operating expenses may increase from the amortization of those assets 
acquired intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows as of january  in thousands  except for years gross value accumulated amortization net value weighted average remaining amortization period years developed technology customer relationships trademarks noncompete agreements in process research and development we acquired ipr d of million in connection with our acquisition of coppergate

the increase of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to foreign exchange gains 
the decrease of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates earned on our marketable securities portfolio 
our foreign exchange exposure  primarily in the canadian dollar  danish krone  euro and israeli shekel  has increased compared to fiscal as a result of our further expansion into international locations and significant volatility of the us dollar in relation to those currencies 
impairment of investment during our second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million against strategic investments we made in a privately held  venture capital funded technology company 
this impairment charge represents million to fully write down the carrying value of our preferred stock investment and million to fully reserve the convertible note and accrued interest receivable from this company due to our expected inability to collect it

these outflows of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities were partially offset by million of cash generated from our operating activities and million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  as of january  we held million of long term marketable securities 
although these marketable securities have maturities of greater than one year  we hold them as available for sale and may access these funds prior to their contractual maturities 
we previously held auction rate securities  or ars 
ars are bought and sold in the market place through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
subsequent to february  all auctions involving the ars that we held failed 
in october  we accepted an offer of a comprehensive settlement agreement from our cash investment advisor  ubs  in which all the ars that we held could be redeemed at par value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  all of the ars that we held were redeemed at par value

these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in inventories and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non current assets 
non cash adjustments included in net income in fiscal consisted primarily of million for depreciation and amortization  million for stock based compensation expense and a benefit of million for deferred income taxes 
the increase in inventories was the result of an increase in our die bank and finished goods as a result of an easing in supply of wafers and an increase in our die bank for our newer generation products to meet forecasted demand 
despite the increase in inventories  our annualized rate of inventory turns increased to times per year for fiscal compared to times per year for fiscal as a result of the overall increase in shipments in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payment for inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of decreased product shipments and timing of billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average days sales outstanding increased to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix

the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of increased billings due to increased product shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average days sales outstanding improved to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix

these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments for tax liabilities and software licenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower product revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventories resulted from an increase in our die bank level at the end of the fiscal at the end of fiscal  our die bank was somewhat elevated relative to our sales volume due to a strategic build up of certain wafers for some of our key customers 
the increase in other long term liabilities is primarily due to higher deferred tax obligations which resulted in increased long term income taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities 
non cash charges included stock based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  provision for sales returns  discounts and doubtful accounts of million  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal cash flows from our operating activities will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow net revenues while managing the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products

while we generated cash from operations for fiscal  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities during or beyond the next months and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue  the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
from time to time  we may also increase our long term investments which will cause our marketable securities balances to fluctuate 
our marketable securities include primarily certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  corporate commercial paper  money market funds and us agency discount notes 
we monitor all our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have had a decline in fair value  we use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we would recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our customers based on purchase orders received as well as forecasts from such customers 
purchase orders with delivery dates greater than twelve weeks are typically cancelable without penalty to our customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor wafers  other materials and finished goods from our suppliers on an eight to sixteen week lead time basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
to mitigate some of the foreign currency exchange rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity at january  and january   we held approximately million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity we transact our revenues in us dollars 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency except for our subsidiaries in canada  denmark  france  japan  taiwan and vietnam where the canadian dollar  danish krone  euro  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong are the primary financial currencies  respectively 
additionally  a significant portion of our israel subsidiary s expenses are payroll related and are denominated in israeli shekels 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the israeli shekel 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the israeli shekel  our israel subsidiary will experience a negative impact on its results of operations 
we engage in hedging activity to mitigate the risk that to the extent the us dollar weakens against the israeli shekel  our israel subsidiary would experience a negative impact on its results of operations 
as of january   with the exception of our israel operation  we had not entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
for our israel operation  we do hedge portions of our forecasted expenses that are denominated in the israeli shekel with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of january  and january   we had foreign exchange forward and option contracts with notional amounts of million and million  respectively  in place to hedge certain forecasted israeli shekels denominated operating expenses of our israel operation 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
these hedges of cash flow exposures will only mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange exposure 
we will remain exposed to the currency risk of our cash flow exposures 
we maintain certain cash balances denominated in the canadian dollar  danish krone  euro  hong kong dollar  israeli shekel  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by million
