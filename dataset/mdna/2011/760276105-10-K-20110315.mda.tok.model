item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a delaware holding company organized in that offers scheduled passenger services through our wholly owned operating air carrier subsidiaries chautauqua airlines  inc chautauqua  shuttle america corporation shuttle  republic airline inc republic airline  frontier airlines  inc frontier  and lynx airlines  inc lynx 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the terms the company  we  us  or our  refer to republic airways holdings inc and our subsidiaries 
as of december   our operating subsidiaries offered scheduled passenger service on approximately  flights daily to cities in states  canada  mexico  and costa rica under our frontier operations  and through fixed fee code share agreements with amr corp  the parent of american airlines  inc american  continental airlines  inc continental  delta air lines  inc 
delta  united air lines  inc united  and us airways  inc 
us airways collectively referred to as our partners 
currently  we provide our partners with fixed fee regional airline services  operating as americanconnection  continental express  delta connection  united express  or us airways express  including service out of their hubs and focus cities 
we have long term  fixed fee regional jet code share agreements with each of our partners that are subject to our maintaining specified performance levels 
pursuant to these fixed fee agreements  which provide for minimum aircraft utilization at fixed rates  we are authorized to use our partners two character flight designation codes to identify our flights and fares in our partners computer reservation systems  to paint our aircraft in the style of our partners  to use their service marks and to market ourselves as a carrier for our partners 
our fixed fee agreements have historically limited our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
certain of these agreements contain minimum guarantee amounts  penalty provisions for either the early removal of aircraft or agreement termination for activity levels below the minimums 
fleet composition the following table outlines the type of aircraft our subsidiaries operate and their respective operations within our business units as of december  fixed fee code share agreement partners operating subsidiaries aircraft size frontier american continental delta united us airways spares number of aircraft chautauqua airlines to shuttle america to republic airline to frontier to lynx total number of operating aircraft during  our operational fleet decreased from to the company removed eight q aircraft from its frontier operations 
five were returned to the lessor  two are held for sale as of december   and one has been subleased 
seven crj aircraft were returned to the lessor from our fixed fee service with continental 
four a aircraft were removed from our frontier operation and sold or returned to the lessor 
two e aircraft were subleased offshore and one e was sold 
four e aircraft and three a aircraft were placed into our frontier operation during the year 
our branded operations are comprised of the former operations of midwest air group  inc midwest and frontier  both of which we acquired in as of october  these operations now fly as a single consolidated branded network under the frontier brand 
frontier has the largest market share in milwaukee and the second largest market share in denver 
our branded operation has a significant base of frequent flyer members and strong support in their local communities of denver and milwaukee 
business strategy continue to operate a high quality fleet of aircraft across an efficient network we intend to maintain a modern  high quality fleet of aircraft that meets or exceeds stringent industry operating standards and complies with the terms of our fixed fee regional jet code share agreements 
we also intend to continue to operate and optimize our existing network and hubs to make our network as efficient as possible for both our partners and branded customers 
continue to operate a diversified business model that generates compelling returns on invested capital for our shareholders our business model is unique among us airlines in that it combines the stable cash flow generation of our fixed fee regional jet operations with the attractive growth prospects of our branded operations at frontier 
we believe that this diversity of service offerings provides us with a distinct advantage over our competitors and provides for a very stable base of cash flows as well as significant upside from our branded frontier platform 
pursue a fleet renewal strategy that further improves our cost structure as previously disclosed  we have placed a firm order with embraer for the delivery of six e aircraft with the option to purchase another e e aircraft at a later time 
this decision supports our strategy to continue exiting the smaller regional jet aircraft market and focus on larger aircraft at both our regional jet and branded operations which will greatly enhance republic unit cost structure 
continue to take advantage of growth opportunities resulting from industry consolidation and continue to grow frontier network it is our belief that the recent merger activity in the domestic airline sector could lead to further opportunities for republic to gain market share as the large network carriers consolidate their hubs and reduce their presence in certain markets 
pursue alliances to broaden our existing network and customer reach we intend to pursue strategic and long term alliances with other airlines in order to broaden our existing network  generate larger economies of scale and provide a greater number of attractive destinations to both existing and new customers 
we believe that strategic alliances are a cost effective method to grow our market share and expand our customer base 
revenue fixed fee service under our code share arrangements with our partners  we receive fixed fees  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior performance 
for the years ended december   and  all of our fixed fee revenue was earned under our fixed fee arrangements 
the number of aircraft we operate and aircraft utilization are the most significant drivers of our revenue  as opposed to the number of passengers we carry or the fare the passengers pay 
passenger service branded passenger service includes passenger ticket revenue on our branded airlines frontier  midwest from august to october  and mokulele from april to october 
unlike our fixed fee business  the most significant drivers of our revenue are the number of passengers we carry and the fare paid by the passenger

the credits are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease of the aircraft 
maintenance and repair maintenance and repair expenses include all parts  materials  tooling and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
we have entered into long term maintenance power by the hour service contracts with third party maintenance providers under which we are charged fixed rates for each flight hour accumulated by the majority of our engines and some of the major airframe components

at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
the company currently anticipates that its unrestricted cash on hand  the cash generated from operations  and other financings will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
working capital deficits are customary for airlines since the air traffic liability and a portion of the deferred frequent flyer revenue are classified as current liabilities 
our liquidity depends on the number of passengers who fly in our frontier operations  the fares they pay  the cost of fuel  our operating and capital expenditures  our financing activities  the financial strength of our partners in relation to our fixed fee business  and the amount of cash holdbacks imposed by our credit card processors 
we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  an economic recession  a global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the reduction on our credit card holdbacks and the timing of the processing of the holdback settlements 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to timing differences in our working capital

net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company received net proceeds of million from a second public offering completed in november 
the company made principal repayments of million and retired million of aircraft debt totaling million compared to repayments of million and retirements of million totaling million in the company received proceeds of million from the financing of other equipment during compared to as of december   we had total cash of million of which million was unrestricted 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
working capital deficits are customary for airlines since the air traffic liability and a portion of the deferred frequent flyer revenue are classified as current liabilities 
our liquidity depends to a large extent on the financial strength of our partners in relation to our fixed fee business and the number of passengers who fly in our branded passenger service  the fares they pay  our operating and capital expenditures  our financing activities  the amount of cash holdbacks imposed by our credit card processors  and the cost of fuel 
we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  the economic recession  the global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million decrease in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the lower operating margin associated with our branded operations and the related reductions in our net income period over period of million 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company acquired and debt financed e aircraft and e aircraft 
the total debt related to these aircraft of million was obtained from banks at terms of to years and fixed interest rates ranging from to and variable rates at libor plus a margin 
cash used in the acquisition of aircraft and other equipment  net of aircraft deposits totaled million in and million in the company has lease financed all other aircraft deliveries during the company received proceeds from the sale of its e assets and other equipment totaling million in compared to million in additionally  the company funded notes receivable of approximately million to frontier  us airways  midwest  and mokulele in compared to million in additionally  the company acquired new businesses midwest and frontier  net of cash acquired totaling million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company received proceeds of million from the refinancing of aircraft and issuance of debt compared to million in during  the company made principal repayments of million and retired million of aircraft debt totaling million compared to repayments of million and retirements of million totaling million in during the prior year  the company repurchased million of treasury stock and there were no treasury stock repurchases in other liquidity initiatives in may  we successfully negotiated a new agreement to consolidate all of our visa and mastercard bankcard transactions to one processor 
under the new agreement  the company received a five percent relief of its previously collateralized bankcard liability 
upon achieving certain financial conditions  which relate to levels of operating income and cash flow coverage  the company can attain a lower holdback 
historically  frontier cash settlements were two to three weeks in arrears  but under our current relationship those settlements occur on a daily basis 
so at the end of  we had received all of the cash from the year end holiday travelers whereas at the end of the processor still held that cash 
in november  the company completed a stock offering and received net proceeds from this offering of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated transaction expenses 
we will use the net proceeds from this offering of the common stock for general corporate purposes  including to finance a portion of our embraer aircraft  and to bolster our liquidity position 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under certain of our financing arrangements 
we are required to maintain a certain level of minimum unrestricted cash and maintain certain cash flow and working capital covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all our covenants 
letters of credit as we enter new markets  increase the amount of space we lease  or add leased aircraft  we are often required to provide the airport authorities and lessors with a letter of credit 
we also provide letters of credit for our workers compensation insurance 
as of december  and  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  all of which are bond and cash collateralized 
fuel hedging transactions our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk  we periodically purchase call options  enter in fuel swap agreements  or enter into costless collars on various oil derivative commodities 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we choose not to designate these derivatives as hedges  and  as such  realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments are included in aircraft fuel expense in the consolidated statements of income loss 
a one dollar change in price per barrel of crude oil or the crack spread will increase or decrease our fuel expense by million 
a one cent change in the cost of each gallon of fuel would impact our pre tax income by approximately million per year based on our current fleet and aircraft fuel consumption 
under our fixed fee agreements we are not exposed to changes in fuel prices 
our fixed fee agreements provide for our partners to purchase fuel directly or reimburse us for fuel expense as a pass through cost 
as of december   our frontier operation had hedged five percent of its anticipated volume in the second  third  and fourth quarters of subsequent to december   frontier hedged additional volumes under swap agreements that brought frontier hedge position to approximately in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarters of we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available  with the goal of at least becoming hedged in our frontier operations 
aircraft leases and other off balance sheet arrangements we have significant obligations for aircraft and engines that are classified as operating leases and  therefore  are not reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet 
aircraft leases expire between and as of december   our total mandatory payments under operating leases for aircraft aggregated approximately billion and total minimum annual aircraft rental payments for the next months under all non cancelable operating leases is approximately million 
other non cancelable operating leases consist of engines  terminal space  operating facilities  office space and office equipment 
the leases expire through as of december   our total mandatory payments under other non cancelable operating leases aggregated approximately million 
total minimum annual other rental payments for the next months are approximately million 
purchase commitments as of december   the company had firm orders to purchase eight a aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in february and continuing through november  cs aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in early and continuing through  and six e jets with a conditional firm order for e or e jets 
the six e aircraft are expected to be delivered between august and december the company also has a commitment to acquire nine spare aircraft engines and expects to take delivery of one engine in  two engines in  two engines in  and four engines beyond during  the company entered into agreements to lease seven a aircraft for six years from the date of delivery 
these aircraft will be delivered between january and june we expect to fund future capital and funding commitments through internally generated funds  third party aircraft financings  and debt and other financings 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  include the following in thousands payments due by period beyond total long term debt including interest operating leases tax liability for uncertain tax positions debt or lease financed aircraft purchase obligations engines under firm orders total contractual cash obligations and contain twelve and six conditional firm orders on e  respectively the company has a finance commitment at current market terms on the six firm e scheduled for delivery throughout the company has maintenance agreements for engines  auxiliary power units apu and other airframe components for our e and e aircraft 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the engines  apus  avionics and wheels and brakes through october  june  december and june  respectively 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the avionics  wheels and brakes  apus and engines through december  february  july and december  respectively 
under these agreements  we are charged for covered services based on a fixed rate for each flight hour or flight cycle accumulated by the engines or airframes in our service during each month 
the rates are subject to annual revisions  generally based on certain bureau of labor statistics labor and material indices 
we believe these agreements  coupled with our ongoing maintenance program  reduce the likelihood of unexpected levels of engine  apu  avionics and wheels and brakes maintenance expense during their term 
certain of these agreements contain minimum guarantee amounts  penalty provisions for either the early removal of aircraft or agreement termination for activity levels below the minimums 
while the company does not have long term maintenance agreements for airbus except for wheels and brakes and q fleets  it has made significant deposits with the aircraft lessors for future maintenance events which will reduce future cash requirements 
as of december  we had maintenance deposits of million 
total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant tax payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed fee service under our fixed fee arrangements with our partners  the company receives fixed fees for our capacity purchase agreements  as well as reimbursement of specified pass through costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior service 
these revenues are recognized in the period the service is provided  and we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
the reimbursement of specified costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger liability and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes  fuel  landing fees and catering 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed for reimbursement 
under the company s code share agreements  the company is reimbursed an amount per aircraft designed to compensate the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
the company has concluded that a component of its fixed fee service revenues under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during  and was million  million  and million  respectively  and has been included in fixed fee service revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income loss 
revenue recognition passenger service passenger service revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided or after the tickets expire which is either immediately upon the scheduled departure of the flight or up to thirteen months after the date of issuance depending on the type of ticket purchased  and are net of excise taxes  passenger facility charges and security fees 
passenger service revenues that have been deferred are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as air traffic liability 
included in passenger service revenue are change fees imposed on passengers for making schedule changes to non refundable tickets 
change fees are recognized as revenue at the time the change is made for the passenger as these fees are a separate transaction that occur subsequent to the date of the original ticket sale 
the company is required to charge certain taxes and fees on passenger tickets 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes 
these taxes and fees are legal assessments on the customer  for which the company has an obligation to act as a collection agent 
because the company is not entitled to retain these taxes and fees  such amounts are not included in passenger service revenue 
the company records a liability when the amounts are collected and reduces the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier 
we reclassified million of on board sales of livetv  liquor and food and baggage fees recorded in other revenues to passenger revenues in our december  consolidated statement of income loss 
these reclassifications had no effect on previously reported operating income or net income 
frequent flyer programs the company has a frequent flyer program that offers incentives to travel on its airlines and promotes customer loyalty 
the program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on frontier and through participating companies  such as credit card companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
the company also sells mileage credits to nonairline businesses 
the mileage credits may be redeemed for free air travel on frontier  as well as hotels  rental cars  and other awards 
earned mileage credits the company also defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value of the air transportation for mileage credits awarded and recognizes that amount as passenger service revenue when the mileage credit is redeemed and the transportation is provided 
the fair value of the air transportation component is determined utilizing the deferred revenue method as further described below 
the initial revenue deferral is presented as deferred frequent flyer revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
when recognized  the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as passenger service revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income loss 
the company s accounting policy for its frequent flyer program is the deferred revenue method 
the deferred revenue method is to record the frequent flyer obligation by allocating an equivalent weighted average ticket value to each outstanding mile based on projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed 
such value is estimated assuming redemptions on our airline  and other redemption choices and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service and redemption choices 
the estimation of the value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required 
for example  management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on the company s airline versus on other redemption choices 
since the equivalent ticket value on miles redeemed on frontier and other redemption choices can vary greatly  this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weighted average ticket value from period to period 
management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of frontier customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles  each of which can have materially different estimated values 
such choices include different classes of service and award levels 
customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes  which occur from time to time  introducing new award choices or making material changes to the terms of existing award choices 
management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior  which requires the use of significant judgment 
management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates  but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior patterns  which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in historical changes to deferred frequent flyer revenue balances and to recognized revenue 
the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles  regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award 
eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to redeem awards  or their account will deactivate after a period of inactivity  in which case the company will recognize the related revenue when the miles expire as passenger service revenue 
current and future changes to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred frequent flyer revenue balance as well as recognized revenue from the program 
mileage credits sold the company has agreements with its co branded credit card partner that require its partner to purchase miles as they are awarded to the co branded partner cardholders 
the air transportation element for the awarded miles is included in deferred frequent flyer revenue at the estimated fair value of the air transportation element and the residual marketing element is recorded as cargo and other revenue when the miles are awarded 
the deferred frequent flyer revenue is subsequently recognized as passenger service revenue when the transportation is provided 
the company also sells mileage credits in its frequent flyer programs to third parties 
the travel portion of the sale is recognized as part of deferred frequent flyer revenue 
the remaining portion  referred to as the marketing component  is recognized as cargo and other revenue in the month the miles are sold 
aircraft leases the company has aircraft that are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is responsible for all other maintenance costs of its aircraft and must meet specified return conditions upon lease expiration for both the airframes and engines 
impairments to long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and residual values for our definite lived assets 
as a result of the company s annual impairment test for the indefinite lived other intangible assets the company recorded an impairment for the trade names 
impairments to goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  in thousands gross carrying amount impairment net balance at january  and december  impairment during midwest acquisistion during balance at december  and during and prior to the acquisition of midwest in july  the company had one reporting unit and all of the goodwill of million was assigned to that unit 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues  expenses  and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the regional airline industry 
an impairment loss will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information included in the company s determination of fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  market valuation comparisons to similar airlines  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
during the first quarter of  the company performed an interim test of its goodwill 
factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential triggering event included record high fuel prices  a softening us economy and the differences between market capitalization of our stock as compared to the book value of equity 
as a result of the testing  the company determined that the goodwill was completely impaired and recorded an impairment charge during the first quarter of to write off the full value of goodwill 
the company s acquisition of midwest resulted in approximately million of goodwill which was assigned to the company s branded operations reporting unit 
as of december   the company performed its annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill 
the branded operations reporting unit book value of invested capital exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
the company determined the fair value of the branded invested capital utilizing the income  market  and cost approach 
the company fair value calculations for goodwill are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
as a result of failing step one  the company was required to perform step two of the asc topic goodwill impairment testing methodology 
in step two of the impairment testing  the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the company utilized its recent valuations of tangible and intangible assets related to the branded operations reporting unit to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities 
as a result of the step two testing  the company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a full impairment charge on december   the company s annual assessment date 
factors attributable to the impairment of goodwill consisted of the following increased competition in our key markets including denver and milwaukee  current economic conditions and forecasts within the united states  volatility of fuel prices  and other related factors 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
the company charges expenses as incurred under the direct expense method 
engines and certain airframe component overhaul and repair costs are subject to power by the hour contracts with external vendors and are expensed as the aircraft are flown 
as a result of the acquisition of frontier  the company acquired deposits related to leased aircraft at frontier 
the company has determined that it is probable that substantially all maintenance deposits will be refunded through qualifying maintenance activities 
deposits are reimbursed based on the specific event for each specified deposit  as determined by the lease 
the projected ultimate cost was based on actual historical repair invoices as well as estimates 
this analysis was performed by lease and by deposit type 
as of december   the company anticipates no unused excess amounts to be expensed based on this analysis 
the company will continue to evaluate whether it is probable the deposits will be returned to reimburse the costs of the maintenance activities incurred 
as the company makes future payments  if the deposits are less than probable of being returned  they will be recognized as additional expense at that time 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
certain of our nols generated prior to july and acquired from midwest and frontier are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of deferred tax asset  and other carry forwards becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized 
intangible assets commuter slots 
the company acquired commuter slots during at the new york laguardia and ronald reagan washington national airports from us airways 
the licensing agreement with the company and us airways for the laguardia commuter slots expired on december   but we maintain a security interest in the laguardia slots if us airways fails to perform under the current licensing agreement 
the estimated useful lives of these commuter slots were determined based upon the period of time cash flows are expected to be generated by the commuter slots and by researching the estimated useful lives of commuter slots or similar intangibles by other airlines 
in addition  an estimated residual value was determined using estimates of the expected fair value of the commuter slots at the end of the expected useful life 
the residual value will be assessed annually for impairment 
the estimated useful lives are also reviewed annually 
as a result of the acquisitions of frontier and midwest during the year ended december   the company acquired slots at the new york  laguardia  ronald reagan washington national and newark liberty international airports 
management concluded these slots were indefinite lived assets given the nature of the assets and existing and pending legislation regarding slots at the aforementioned airports

pertaining to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance will affect accounting and reporting for companies that enter into multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with their customers when those arrangements are within the scope of accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance will be effective for the company prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   with early adoption permitted 
we have not early adopted the guidance and are currently evaluating the impact that asu no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc 
this amendment requires disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this amendment is effective for periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company has adopted this amendment on january  by adding additional disclosures  except for the additional level requirements which will be adopted in fiscal year in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  which revised the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition  except the company no longer needs to disclose the date through which subsequent events are evaluated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have been and are subject to market risks  including commodity price risk such as  to a limited extent  aircraft fuel prices and interest rate risk 
interest rates our earnings can be affected by changes in interest rates due to the amount of cash and securities held and variable rate debt 
at december  and  approximately million and million of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates  respectively 
however  at december  all of our long term debt was fixed rate debt 
a one hundred basis point change in the libor rate would have increased or decreased interest expense by million for and we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through the manufacturer  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements our reimbursement rates may not be adjusted higher or lower to reflect any changes in our aircraft rental rates 
aircraft fuel price risk our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk  we periodically purchase call options  enter into fuel swap agreements  or enter into costless collars on various oil derivative commodities 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we choose not to designate these derivatives as hedges  and  as such  realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments are included in aircraft fuel expense in the consolidated statements of income loss 
a one dollar change in price per barrel of crude oil will increase or decrease our fuel expense by million 
a one cent change in the cost of each gallon of fuel would impact our pre tax income by approximately million per year based on our current fleet and aircraft fuel consumption 
under our fixed fee agreements we are not exposed to changes in fuel prices 
our fixed fee agreements provide for our partners to purchase fuel directly or reimburse us for fuel expense as a pass through cost 
as of december   our frontier operation had hedged five percent of its anticipated volume in the second  third  and fourth quarters of subsequent to december   frontier hedged additional volumes with swap agreements that currently have frontier hedged fifteen percent in the second quarter  ten percent in the third quarter  and ten percent in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available  with the goal of at least becoming hedged in our frontier operations
