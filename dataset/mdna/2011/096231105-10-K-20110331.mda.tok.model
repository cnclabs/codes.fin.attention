executive overview our results reflect an increased focus on our fee based service business and our continuing efforts to improve our cash flows from operations through initiatives designed to increase cash received upon sales of vois and to achieve selling and marketing efficiencies in our bluegreen resorts segment 
while we believe that our cash flows from operations and our bluegreen resorts business operating results reflect the success of these efforts  the bluegreen communities business continued to be impacted by low consumer demand for homesites 
on march   we announced that we had engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for bluegreen communities  including a possible sale of the division 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding the timing or whether we will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives we may consider  or that any such alternatives  if pursued and ultimately consummated  will result in improvements to our financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the benefits we expect to realize from the transaction 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted asu and asu effective january   which resulted in our consolidation of the special purpose finance entities associated with past securitization transactions which were previously reported off balance sheet 
in addition to the material changes to our consolidated balance sheet  the consolidation of these special purpose finance entities impacted our consolidated statement of operations during  by increasing our interest income from voi notes receivable and increasing interest expense on notes payable compared to prior periods 
our statements of operations for the years ended december  and and our balance sheet as of december  have not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of asu and asu therefore  results will not be comparable to prior period amounts  particularly with regards to vacation ownership sales and services  interest expense and interest income 
during the year ended december  we generated free cash flow cash flow from operating and investing activities of million 
voi system wide sales  which include sales of third party developer inventory  totaled million  reflecting a increase over our sales and marketing fee based service business sold million of third party developer inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million 
including our resort management  resort title  construction management and other operations  our total resort fee based services revenues were million in  a increase compared to we recorded a non cash charge of million to increase the allowance for loan losses on our voi notes receivable generated prior to december  the date we implemented fico score based credit underwriting standards  as we now anticipate that lower fico receivables may experience higher losses later in their contractual term than originally estimated 
our bluegreen communities business generated a segment operating loss of million  including non cash impairment charges of million associated with the write down of the inventory balances of certain communities properties 
we successfully completed the securitization of of voi notes receivable 
we believe our fee based service business enables us to leverage our management  sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  title and construction experience to generate fee based service relationships with third parties 
our provision of these services requires significantly less capital investment than our traditional vacation ownership business 
we began selling and marketing third party vacation ownership inventory in july of  and during and  we sold million and million  respectively  of third party inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   we had six fee based sales and marketing service contracts as compared to four at december  in addition to the sales and marketing of third party vois  we have also generated fee based income by providing resort and reservation management services  title services  construction consulting services where we manage the construction  design and development of voi inventory for third parties  and mortgage servicing of the voi notes originated from the sales of certain of the third party vois 
our goal is for fee based services to become an increasing portion of our resorts business over time  however  there is no assurance that this will be the case 
additionally  consistent with our initiatives to improve our liquidity  we further increased both the percentage of our sales that are cash and our average down payment on financed sales 
including down payments received on financed sales  of our sales were received in cash within approximately days from the contract date in  compared to in refer to liquidity and capital resources section below for additional information 
due to a significant reduction of liquidity in the receivable backed credit markets commencing in the fourth quarter of and our continued desire to manage efficiencies in our timeshare marketing costs  we purposely and significantly reduced our sales volumes in the fourth quarter of since that time  we have and intend to continue to adjust our sales volumes based on available liquidity in the receivable credit markets  the success of our efforts to increase the amount of cash paid at or shortly after the time that sales contracts are entered into and our ability to achieve desired levels of marketing efficiencies 
we believe that our other resort fee based services and finance operations represent recurring cash generating sources of income which do not require material liquidity support from the credit markets 
we also believe  based on anticipated sales levels  that we have adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy our projected sales for a number of years 
however  our bluegreen resorts sales and marketing operations are materially dependent on the availability of liquidity in the credit markets  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
our bluegreen communities business has been  and continues to be  adversely impacted by the deterioration in the real estate markets 
we have continued to experience a decrease in demand  and a related decrease in sales volume 
we have significantly reduced prices on certain of our homesites in an attempt to increase sales activity 
during  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of our communities properties to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 
on march   we announced that we had engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for bluegreen communities  including a possible sale of the division 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding the timing or whether we will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives we may consider  or that any such alternatives  if pursued and ultimately consummated  will result in improvements to our financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the benefits we expect to realize from the transaction 
also  there can be no assurance that our announcement regarding strategic alternatives will not have a material adverse effect on our bluegreen communities operations 
in the event that adverse conditions in the real estate market continue or deteriorate further  the carrying value of our bluegreen communities inventory would be reevaluated and could result in additional material impairment charges 
impairment charges may also be required to the extent that additional market information obtained during the strategic review process indicates that the carrying value of our bluegreen communities inventory exceeds its fair value 
seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and results of operations 
this seasonality may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
although we typically see more potential customers at our sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september  ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to down payment requirements for recognition of real estate sales under gaap or due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
notes receivable and allowance for loan losses we have historically financed a majority of bluegreen resorts sales of vois  and accordingly  are subject to the risk of defaults by customers 
gaap requires that we reduce sales of vois by our estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated voi receivables  excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries of defaulted inventory 
the allowance for loan losses for each business segment as of december  and was as follows in thousands bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities total december  notes receivable non securitized notes receivable securitized allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable december  notes receivable non securitized notes receivable securitized allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable the table below sets forth the activity in our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable for the year ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of year one time impact of asu and provision for loan losses less write offs of uncollectible receivables balance  end of year on january   we adopted asu and asu  which required us to consolidate the special purpose finance entities that we previously reported off balance sheet 
includes provision for loan losses on homesite notes receivable 
includes charges totaling million to increase the allowance on voi loans generated prior to december  we believe that relatively high unemployment in the united states and adverse economic conditions in general have adversely impacted  and may continue to adversely impact  the performance of our notes receivable portfolio in the form of relatively higher defaults and lower prepayment rates than we have historically experienced 
our estimates regarding our allowance for loan losses involve interpretation of historical data  assumptions relative to the impact of loan seasoning  prepayments and estimates of the effect of the higher default experience over the past two years on remaining performance 
to the extent that these estimates change  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as a result of changes in our estimates related to the future performance of loans originated prior to our implementation of fico score based credit underwriting standards in december  during we recorded charges of million 
we anticipate that our fico score based credit underwriting standards on new loan originations which we implemented in december and enhanced in january and higher levels of customer equity in the existing loan portfolio will have a favorable impact on the performance of the portfolio over time  although there is no assurance that this will be the case 
while we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved at this time  there can be no assurance that future defaults will occur at expected levels 
if the future performance of our loans varies from our expectations and estimates  additional charges may be required in the future 
the average annual default rates and delinquency rates more than days past due on bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities receivables owned or serviced by us based on our collection policies were as follows average annual default rates year ended december  division bluegreen resorts loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  bluegreen communities delinquency rates as of december  division bluegreen resorts loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  bluegreen communities as of december   we were in the process of foreclosing on a total of nine bluegreen communities receivables 
had we completed the foreclosure process in  the bluegreen communities average annual default rate would have been approximately and during and  respectively  and the delinquency rate would have been approximately as of december  the percentage of our serviced voi notes receivable portfolio that was over days past due as of the dates indicated 
we believe reflects the benefits of our credit underwriting standards as well as our policy that loans are not defaulted until after days past due 
the average annual default rate and the delinquency rate as of december  related to voi loans originated on or after december  do not reflect sufficient default experience of the underlying loans  and therefore  do not represent a meaningful comparison to the december  period 
substantially all defaulted vacation ownership notes receivable result in the holder of the note receivable recovering the related voi that secured the note receivable  typically soon after default and at little or no cost 
the recovered voi is then resold in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely impacted 
revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
sales of real estate in accordance with the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification standards acs  real estate revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
under timeshare accounting rules  the buyer s minimum cash down payment towards the purchase of our vois is met only if the cash down payment received  reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale  is at least of the sales price 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type  or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may result in additional voi sales being deferred  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
in cases where all development has not been substantially completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
the timeshare accounting rules require the use of the relative sales value method for relieving voi inventory and recording cost of sales 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed voi inventory  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
for communities real estate projects  costs are allocated to individual homesites in the communities projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each homesite without regard to defaults or repossessed inventory 
under this method  the allocated cost of a homesite is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon recognition of the related sale 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
fee based sales commissions and other operations revenue in addition to sales of real estate  we also generate revenue from the activities listed below 
the table provides a brief description of the applicable revenue recognition policy activity revenue is recognized when fee based sales commissions the sale transaction with the voi purchaser is consummated in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party developer and the related consumer rescission period has passed 
resort management and service fees management services are rendered 
resort title fees escrow amounts are released and title documents are completed 
rental and sampler program guests complete stays at the resorts 
rental and sampler program proceeds are classified as a reduction to cost of other resort and communities operations 
communities realty commissions sales of third party owned real estate are completed 
golf course and ski hill daily fees services are provided 
in connection with our management of the property owners associations  among other things  we act as agent for the property owners association to operate the resort as provided under the management agreement 
in certain cases  the personnel at the resorts are bluegreen employees 
the property owners association bears all of the economic costs of such personnel and generally pays us in advance of  or simultaneously to  the payment of payroll 
in accordance with asc  overall considerations of reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  reimbursements from the property owners associations relating to direct pass through costs are recorded net of the related expenses 
carrying value of completed inventory 
our completed timeshare and homesite inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
during  and  we recorded non cash charges totaling million  million and million  respectively  to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of our completed bluegreen communities properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
carrying value of real estate held for development and under development and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets  and our undeveloped real estate properties or real estate properties under development  if certain trigger events occur 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
during  we recorded an impairment of million to write down the carrying amount of certain undeveloped phases of our bluegreen communities properties to fair value  as we determined that the carrying amounts of these properties would not be recovered by estimated future cash flows 
our assessment consisted of determining recoverability of our costs based on our plans and upon a combination of factors  including estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project  the probability of alternative outcomes  the period required to complete such sales  estimates of costs to complete each project  if needed  and various other factors including relevant market data 
should our estimates of these factors or our plans change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
allowance for loan losses on voi notes receivable 
we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on our voi notes receivable as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize a timeshare sale 
we estimate uncollectible voi notes receivable based on historical uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period  using a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider certain qualitative data  including the aging of the respective receivables  current default trends by origination year  current economic conditions  and the fico scores of the buyers 
additionally  under timeshare accounting requirements  no consideration is given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible voi notes receivable 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
if defaults increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
during  we recorded million of charges as a result of changing our estimate of future loan losses on loans originated prior to our implementation of fico score based credit underwriting standards in december of results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes an allocation of general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not reflect the actual economic costs  contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted

corporate general and administrative expenses excluding mortgage operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see corporate general and administrative expenses below for further discussion 
percentages for cost of real estate sales and gross profit are calculated as a percentage of sales of real estate 
cost of real estate sales and gross profit percentages during were impacted by the decrease in the overall carrying cost of our voi inventory due to the adoption of asu and asu  effective january  bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resort sales and marketing system wide sales of vois 
system wide sales of vois  include sales of bluegreen owned vois as well as sales of vois made on behalf of third parties 
we began selling and marketing vacation ownership inventory on behalf of third parties for a fee one of our fee based services in july of the sales on behalf of third parties are transacted through the same selling and marketing process we use to sell our owned voi inventory 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of both bluegreen vois and voi sales made on behalf of outside developers for a fee for the periods indicated

sales of bluegreen resorts real estate represent sales of bluegreen owned vois  as adjusted by changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules  the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and adjustment to allowance for loan losses described below 
sales of bluegreen owned vois are impacted by the timing of when a sale meets the criteria for revenue recognition 
sales of bluegreen owned vois that do not meet the revenue recognition criteria as of the end of a period are deferred to a future period until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
during  due to the timing of revenue recognition  we realized a net recognition of approximately million of sales compared to a net recognition of approximately million of sales in voi revenue is reduced by our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable 
estimated losses for uncollectible voi notes receivable vary with the amount of financed sales during the period  and changes in our estimates of future note receivable performance for newly originated loans and the future performance of our existing loan portfolio 
during the years ended december  and  we reduced revenue by million and million  respectively  for the estimated future uncollectibles on loans originated in these periods 
additionally  during  we recorded charges of million to increase our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable in connection with the lower fico score loans generated prior to december   the date at which we implemented fico score based credit standards 
in connection with our analysis of loan performance performed during  we concluded that these lower fico score loans have not experienced the same benefit of seasoning as other loans in the same vintage historically have  thus resulting in the probability of higher future defaults on such loans 
while we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved at this time  there can be no assurance that defaults have stabilized or that they will not increase 
sales of bluegreen resorts real estate prior to changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules  the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and adjustment to allowance for loan losses described above were million in compared to million in cost of real estate sales 
bluegreen resorts cost of sales was million and million in and  respectively 
cost of sales varies between periods based on the sales volumes  the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the vois sold 
additionally  cost of sales during was impacted by the decrease in the overall carrying cost of our voi inventory due to the adoption of asu and asu  effective january  in addition  the increase in our loan loss reserve during impacted our future projected product margins  which decreased the carrying cost of inventory in accordance with applicable timeshare accounting rules 
during the year ended december   bluegreen resorts gross profit percentage was  compared to during the year ended december  the increase in the gross profit percentages during is mainly attributed to the decrease in the carrying cost of our voi inventory as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standards on january  as described above 
fee based sales commission revenue 
as described above  in july  we began selling and marketing third parties vacation ownership inventory for a fee 
we earn commissions for the sales of third party inventory upon the closing of the respective sales transaction 
during the years ended december  and  we sold million and million  respectively  of third party developer inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million and million  respectively 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these sales  we believe we generated approximately million and million in pre tax profits by providing these sales and marketing fee based services during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that fee based services will be a greater portion of our revenues in the future  although there is no assurance that this will be the case 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts were million and million during and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased during  compared to as we expanded our marketing activity consistent with the increase in our system wide sales of vois 
as a percentage of system wide sales  net  selling and marketing expenses remained constant at during and our overall sale to tour ratios decreased slightly during to  compared to in sales to owners  which carry a relatively lower marketing cost  accounted for of system wide sales during  as compared to during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts were million and million during and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased during  compared to due to additional spending required to support the increased level of sales activity 
as a percentage of system wide sales  net  general and administrative expenses remained constant at during and other resort fee based services revenue and costs related to our other resort fee based services were as follows in thousands for the year ended revenues fee based management services title operations other total revenues costs fee based management services title operations net carrying cost of developer inventory other total costs profit fee based management services title operations net carrying cost of developer inventory other total profit other resort fee based services revenue 
our other resort fee based services revenue consists primarily of fees earned for providing management services and fees earned for providing title services for voi transactions 
in exchange for fees  we provide management services to the bluegreen vacation club and to a majority of the property owners associations of the club resorts and club associate resorts 
in connection with our management services provided to bluegreen vacation club  we manage the club reservation system  provide owner services as well as billing and collections services 
revenues generated by other resort fee based services were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues related to other resort fee based services increased in as a result of additional fees earned by providing services to more voi owners and from managing more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december   we managed timeshare resort properties and hotels compared to as of december  additionally  our revenues related to title services increased due to a reduction in our processing back log and the increase in the number of system wide voi sales transactions 
we intend to continue to pursue our efforts to provide resort management and title services to resort developers and others  on a cash fee basis 
while there is no assurance that we will be successful  we hope that this will become an increasing portion of our business over time 
cost of other resort fee based services 
cost of other resort fee based services was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in the cost during is due to the additional service volumes described above 
additionally  the carrying costs of our voi inventory include maintenance fees and developer subsidies on vois in bluegreen owned inventory  paid to the property owners associations that maintain the resorts 
we partially mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned vois 
accordingly  the net carrying cost of developer inventory fluctuates with the number of vois we hold and the number of resorts subject to developer subsidy arrangements  as well as revenue realized from rental and sampler activity 
during and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was offset by rental and sampler revenues  net of expenses  of million and million during and  respectively 
bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resort sales and marketing system wide sales of vois 
system wide sales of vois  include sales of bluegreen owned vois as well as sales of vois made on behalf of third parties which we began the selling and marketing of in july of the following table sets forth certain information for sales of both bluegreen vois and voi sales made on behalf of outside developers for a fee for the periods indicated

sales of bluegreen resorts real estate were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease reflects the deliberate down sizing of our sales and marketing operations through the operation of fewer sales offices and our decision to focus on what we believe are relatively higher efficiency marketing programs 
sales of bluegreen owned vois are impacted by the timing of when a sale meets the criteria for revenue recognition 
sales of bluegreen owned vois that do not meet the revenue recognition criteria as of the end of a period are deferred to a future period until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
during  we realized a net recognition of approximately million of sales  due to the timing of revenue recognition  compared to million of sales in approximately million of gains on sales of voi notes receivable in are reflected as an increase to voi sales 
no such gains were recognized during voi revenue was reduced by our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable of million and million during and  respectively 
these estimates vary with the amount of financed sales during the periods  as well as by our estimate of future note receivable performance 
sales of bluegreen resorts real estate prior to changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules  the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and adjustment to allowance for loan losses described above were million in compared to million in cost of real estate sales 
bluegreen resorts cost of sales was million and million in and  respectively 
cost of sales varies between periods based on the sales volumes  the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the vois sold 
bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the vois sold 
gross margin during as compared to was negatively impacted by the sale of higher cost vois  a result of a change in the mix of inventory sold and the relatively higher cost of vois reacquired in connection with consumer loan defaults on certain previously sold notes receivable 
fee based sales commission revenue 
in july  we began selling and marketing third parties vacation ownership inventory for a fee one of our fee based services 
during  we sold million of outside developer inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these fee based services  we believe we generated approximately million in pre tax profit by providing these sales and marketing fee based services in we anticipate that fee based services will be a greater portion of our revenues and profits in the future 
selling and marketing expenses 
as a result of fewer tours and the operation of fewer sales offices  selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts decreased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in a higher tour to sale conversion rate and a higher proportion of sales in to existing owners  which carry a relatively lower marketing cost  reduced selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales

in connection with our management services provided to the bluegreen vacation club  we manage the club reservation system  provide owner services as well as billing and collections services 
revenues generated by other resort fee based services were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues related to other resort fee based services decreased in as a result of a lower number of voi sales transactions being processed by our title company subsidiary and on the mix of voi inventory sold 
this decrease was partially offset by additional fees earned by providing services to more voi owners and from managing more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december   we managed timeshare properties compared to as of december   primarily as a result of entering into new management contracts in connection with our fee based services 
cost of other resort fee based services 
cost of other resort fee based services was million and million in and  respectively 
cost of other resort fee based services decreased due to the decrease in revenues described above 
additionally  cost of other resort services includes the carrying costs of our voi inventory which relate to maintenance fees and developer subsidies on vois in our inventory paid to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
we partially mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned voi units 
accordingly  the net carrying cost of developer inventory fluctuates with the number of voi units we hold and the number of resorts subject to a developer subsidy arrangement during a period  as well as revenue from rental and sampler activity realized 
during the years ended december  and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was off set by rental sampler revenue  net of expenses  of million and million  respectively  during those periods 
the carrying cost of developer inventory increased in primarily as a result of the opening of our resorts in las vegas  nevada and williamsburg  virginia in the summer of restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we implemented strategic initiatives in the resort division that resulted in the following charges in thousands charges during severance and benefit related costs lease termination obligation fixed assets write downs  net of proceeds other total restructuring includes severance payments made to employees  payroll taxes and other benefit related costs in connection with the terminations of over  employees  as applicable 
includes costs associated with noncancelable property and equipment leases that we have ceased to use  as well as termination fees related to the cancellation of certain contractual lease obligations 
included in this amount are future minimum lease payments in excess of estimated sublease income  fees and expenses for which the provisions of the asc  exit or disposal cost obligations asc were satisfied 
includes write downs of million and million for leasehold improvements and property and equipment  respectively  net of a nominal amount of cash received in connection with the sale of the assets 
as of december   our restructuring liability balance was million and related entirely to lease termination obligations 
goodwill impairment as a result of our annual impairment testing of goodwill for the year ended december   we determined that the fair value of our bluegreen resorts reporting units  based on our overall market capitalization  could not support the book value of goodwill 
accordingly  we wrote off the balance of our goodwill and recorded a charge of million

bluegreen communities year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  and excluding sales of bulk parcels year ended december  december  number of homesites sold average sales price per homesite sales at bluegreen communities have been  and continue to be  adversely impacted by the weakening of the economy in general and the deterioration of the real estate markets  in particular 
we have experienced continued low demand  especially for our higher priced premium homesites 
in response to the deterioration in the real estate markets and in order to stay competitive in certain markets where our competitors have in certain communities aggressively reduced prices  we have significantly reduced prices on completed homesites 
in addition  during  we substantially sold out of certain of our communities  which also contributed to the decrease in sales in the increase in our average sales price per homesite during  compared to reflects changes in the mix of homesites sold during the respective periods 
on march   we announced that we had engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for bluegreen communities  including a possible sale of the division 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding the timing or whether we will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives we may consider  or that any such alternatives  if pursued and ultimately consummated  will result in improvements to our financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the benefits we expect to realize from the transaction 
there can be no assurance that our announcement regarding strategic alternatives will not have a material adverse effect on bluegreen communities operations 
in addition  impairment charges may be required to the extent that additional market information obtained during the strategic review process indicates that the carrying value of our bluegreen communities inventory exceeds its fair value 
bluegreen communities sales during and increased by million and decreased by million  respectively  as a result of the application of percentage of completion method of accounting 
excluding the impact of percentage of completion method of accounting from both periods  bluegreen communities sales during decreased by million or compared to our bluegreen communities homesite inventory consists of substantially completed homesites held for sale and land held for the future development of additional homesites 
as a result of our continued depressed sales volume  reduced prices  and the impact of current sales levels on the forecasted sell out period of our projects  during the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash charges to cost of real estate sales of approximately million and million  respectively  to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of our properties to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell  if applicable 
we calculated the estimated fair value less costs to sell of these properties based on our analysis of their estimated future cash flows  discounted at rates commensurate with the inherent risk 
we estimated future cash flows based upon what we believe to be market participants expectations of future performance  given current and projected forecasts of the economy and real estate markets in general as well as the forecasted sell out periods for each community 
as of december   we evaluated the carrying value of our bluegreen communities inventory carrying value was million as of december  based upon the probability weighted average cash flows at various outcomes  including to develop and sell such inventory as retail homesites or to execute on various strategic alternatives which we may pursue in the near term 
based on the sales prices currently being realized on our homesites and our forecasts of sales pace  we believe that our bluegreen communities inventory carrying value is appropriate 
should the adverse conditions in the real estate markets where we operate continue longer than we have forecasted or deteriorate further  if our performance does not otherwise meet our expectations  or estimates change as we explore strategic alternatives  additional material charges may be recorded 
variations in cost structures and the market pricing of homesites available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects  which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc  also impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
other operations of our bluegreen communities business historically included the operation of several daily fee golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
on december   we sold four of our golf courses located in north carolina and virginia and have reported the operating results of these golf courses as discontinued operations 
we continue to own and operate two golf courses 
during we continued to focus our marketing efforts on internet  billboards  and regionally based advertising 
while we believe this focus will lead to an increase in interest in our properties  we continue to experience relatively lower sales conversion rates 
bluegreen communities total selling and marketing expenses during remained level with the expenses incurred during as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales in  compared to the same period in  is the result of lower sales in bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses increased during  as compared to  primarily as a result of increased costs to settle litigation and a higher proportion of real estate taxes being expensed as incurred rather than capitalized into inventory due to reduced construction and development spending compared to prior periods 
bluegreen communities year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  and excluding sales of bulk parcels year ended december  december  number of homesites sold average sales price per homesite bluegreen communities sales decreased million  or  during  as compared to we experienced continued low demand  especially in our higher priced premium homesites 
throughout  we continued to significantly reduce prices on completed homesites at certain communities 
the decline in our average sales price per homesite in from reflects the sale of reduced price homesites as well as increased sales at communities with lower price levels 
before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and state rescission statutes  during  we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during bluegreen communities sales were increased as a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting by million and million during and  respectively 
as a result of our decreased volume  reduced prices  and the impact of reduced sales on the forecasted sell out period of our projects  we recorded non cash charges to cost of real estate sales of approximately million and million during and  respectively  to write down the inventory balances of certain phases of our communities properties  to their estimated net realizable value 
we calculated the estimated net realizable value of these properties based on our analysis of their estimated future cash flows  given what we believed to be reasonable assumptions 
excluding the inventory charges  bluegreen communities gross margin decreased from during to during the same period in gross margin was negatively impacted in by the reductions in sales prices of certain completed homesites  as well as the sale of a bulk parcel in texas  at cost 
other bluegreen communities operations historically included the operation of several daily fee golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
on december  we sold four of our golf courses located in north carolina and virginia and recognized a million non cash loss in connection with the sale 
the operating results of the four golf courses sold  and the loss on disposal recognized as a result of the sale  are included in discontinued operations 
other communities operations generated a pretax loss of million in compared to a pretax profit of million in the higher profit earned during reflects the one time profit of approximately million associated with the sale of our right to purchase a property in north carolina and decreased golf course green fee volume for part of  which was partially off set by lower cost of generating such revenues as we attempted to manage our golf course operating costs commensurate with the reduced level of play 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during throughout  we continued to reduce our overall advertising spending as we implemented a regionally based sales and marketing strategy 
in anticipation of lower sales volume  we took steps to reduce bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses by reducing our staffing levels and operating fewer sales offices 
as a result  bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during as compared to finance operations as of december   our finance operations included the excess interest spread earned on million of notes receivable 
this amount reflects the consolidation on january  of notes receivable held by special purpose finance entities that were previously not consolidated by us in accordance with then prevailing generally accepted accounting principles 
profit from notes receivable portfolio and mortgage servicing operations 
the following table details the sources of income and related expenses associated with our notes receivable portfolio in thousands for the years ended december  interest income notes receivable non securitized securitized retained interest in notes receivable sold other total interest income servicing fee income securitized notes receivable fee based services total income interest expense receivable backed notes payable non recourse recourse total interest expense on receivable backed notes payable cost of mortgage servicing operations total expenses pre tax profit on notes receivable portfolio and mortgage servicing operations the increase in total interest income on notes receivable during as compared to reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates charged on timeshare loans originated on or after november  as discussed above  the average balances of our notes receivable increased during as a result of the consolidation of notes receivable held by seven of our special purpose finance entities that were previously reported off balance sheet 
accordingly  we previously did not recognize interest income on such notes receivable  but instead recognized interest income through the accretion of interest on our retained interests in the notes held by these entities 
the increase in interest income on notes receivable during as compared to reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates charged on new timeshare loans 
the average balance of our notes receivable increased during as a result of our sole use of on balance sheet facilities to monetize our notes receivable since march  partially offset by higher defaults in compared to during the years ended december  and  interest income from retained interests was reduced by charges of approximately million and million  respectively  for other than temporary decreases in our retained interests in notes receivable sold 
during  the fair value of our retained interests in voi notes receivable was adversely affected by an increase in the discount rate and unfavorable changes in our estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows on our retained interests 
the higher discount rate during reflects an increase in our estimate of the yield which would be required by a potential investor in our retained interests as of december   as compared to mortgage servicing operations 
our mortgage servicing operations include processing payments  and collection of notes receivable owned by us  as well as on notes receivable owned by third parties 
in addition  our mortgage servicing operations facilitate the monetization of our voi notes receivable through our various credit facilities  as well as perform monthly reporting activities for our lenders and receivable investors 
prior to the adoption of asu and asu on january   we recognized servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing for notes receivable that had been sold to off balance sheet special purpose finance entities and for providing loan services to third party portfolio owners on a cash fee basis 
effective january   we ceased recognizing servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing to our special purpose finance entities as such entities are now consolidated by us 
while we still receive mortgage servicing fees for servicing our securitized notes receivable  these amounts are now accounted for as a component of interest income 
during  servicing fee income represented mortgage servicing fees earned for servicing the loan portfolio of a third party developer in connection with one of our fee based services arrangements 
as of december   the total amount of notes receivable serviced by us under this arrangement was million 
the average aggregate principal balance of notes receivables serviced on behalf of third parties decreased during as compared to  as our off balance sheet securitized notes receivable continued to amortize  resulting in lower servicing fee income during as compared to interest expense 
the increase in interest expense on receivable backed notes payable in reflects a higher average debt balance of additional non recourse receivable backed debt recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the consolidation of seven special purpose finance entities as of january  as of december   the outstanding balance of the non recourse receivable backed debt previously reported off balance sheet was million 
our other interest expense  which is mainly comprised of interest on lines of credit and notes payable and our subordinated debentures  was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
other interest expense remained at consistent levels in as compared to  as the benefit of a lower average debt balance and lower interest rates on our junior subordinated debentures was offset by higher interest rates on certain extensions to our existing debt agreements 
other interest expense increased during as compared to as a result of a higher average debt balance and significantly lower amounts capitalized to construction in progress  as described below 
additional interest expense from a higher debt balance in was partially offset by a decline in our average interest rate in due to the repayment in march of million of senior secured notes and the decrease  in general  in the variable rates on certain of our debt 
our effective cost of borrowing was  and during  and  respectively 
a portion of our interest expense  which directly relates to interest on development spending  is capitalized to construction in progress 
interest expense capitalized to construction in progress varies based upon the amount of construction and development spending during the period 
total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was million and million for and  respectively  and was insignificant during the reduction in the interest expense capitalized to construction in progress during and is due to a significantly reduced level of construction and development spending during those periods 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  treasury  and legal 
overall corporate and general administrative costs may fluctuate between periods for various reasons  including but not limited to the timing of professional services and litigation expenses 
in addition  consistent with our segment reporting treatment  changes in the payroll accrual between reporting periods for the entire company are recorded as corporate general and administrative expense 
corporate general and administrative expenses  excluding mortgage servicing operations  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the million  or  decrease in compared to primarily relates to lower litigation costs  the benefit of higher than expected forfeitures on certain stock grants and lower company wide benefit costs 
the million  or  decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to reflects reductions in headcount at our corporate headquarters  offset in part by higher costs related to ongoing litigation and consulting fees paid to outside consultants

other expense  net 
other expense  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other expense  net incurred during includes a million non cash impairment charge related to a write down of one of our assets to be disposed of by sale 
other expense  net incurred during reflects approximately million incurred in connection with exploring possible alternatives for obtaining liquidity of our notes receivable partially offset by the benefit of the termination of certain of our accrued lease obligations in an amount which was approximately million lower than we previously estimated 
other expense  net incurred in primarily reflects a loss on disposal of various fixed assets a result of closing certain of our off site sales offices 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold four of our golf courses located in north carolina and virginia for cash proceeds of approximately million and the net loss on the sale of the golf courses of million has been recorded in discontinued operations 
revenues and expenses from these golf courses have also been reclassified to discontinued operations and consist of the following for the year ended december  golf operations revenue cost of operations income loss from discontinued operations before provision for income taxes loss on the disposal of golf courses provision benefit for income taxes loss from discontinued operations non controlling interests in income of consolidated subsidiary 
we include the results of operations and financial position of bluegreen big cedar vacations  llc the subsidiary  our owned subsidiary  in our consolidated financial statements 
the non controlling interests in income of consolidated subsidiary is the portion of our consolidated pre tax income that is attributable to big cedar  llc  the unaffiliated interest holder in the subsidiary 
non controlling interests in income of consolidated subsidiary was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate has historically ranged between and  based upon the mix of taxable earnings among the various states in which we operate 
our benefit from income taxes in includes a one time benefit of approximately million for an adjustment to deferred income taxes in the second quarter of  a result of certain temporary book and tax differences being deemed permanent see note to the consolidated financial statements 
summary 
our net loss for  and was million  million and million  respectively  as a result of the various factors described above 
changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for  and in thousands year ended cash flows used in provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
we generated million of cash from our operating activities during  as compared to million of cash generated during the increase in cash flows from operating activities during was primarily a result of our consolidation of assets  liabilities  and operations of special purpose finance entities upon our adoption of asu and asu on january   which resulted in changes to our cash flow statement in the form of additional cash receipts from securitized notes receivable now being included in operating cash flows see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
previously  these special purpose finance entities were not consolidated and the net cash flow associated with their operations which consist of collecting principal and interest payments on notes receivable and making interest and debt repayments was recorded as a component of investing activities as cash received from retained interests 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities also was the result of significantly lower development spending  our successful efforts to receive larger down payments on our sales and generate a higher percentage of cash voi sales  and increased revenues related to our fee based services  substantially all of which are provided on a cash basis 
we generated million of cash from our operating activities during  as compared to million of cash used during the increase in cash flows from operating activities during compared to was primarily a result of significantly lower inventory development spending  our successful efforts to receive larger down payments and generate a higher percentage of cash from voi sales  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the successful implementation of certain strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition  operating cash flows for benefited from million of proceeds from off balance sheet sales of note receivable with no such proceeds included in operating cash flows during to the extent we provide financing to customers who qualify  operating cash flows are expected to be negative in periods where sales and marketing expenses exceed cash collections from voi sales 
we monetize our receivables through various on balance sheet purchase facilities and hypothecation facilities  the cash flows from which are included in cash provided by financing activities 
only when we previously structured receivable finance transactions as off balance sheet sales did the associated cash proceeds increase cash from operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
we used million of cash in our investing activities during  as compared to million of cash generated during the decrease in cash flows from investing activities during was primarily the result of the required reclassification of cash received from retained interests in notes receivable sold as a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance as discussed above in cash flows from operating activities compared to amounts received in additionally  during we reduced our spending for property and equipment to million  as compared to million in  and  we realized million of cash from the sale of golf courses in we generated million of cash in our investing activities during  as compared to million of cash generated during cash flows provided by investing activities increased million from million during to million during the increase was the result of lower purchases of property and equipment million in compared to million in  partially offset by lower cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold as compared to amounts received in in addition  we paid million in to acquire the real estate and operations at two resorts  the royal suites at atlantic palace in atlantic city  new jersey  and club la pension in new orleans  louisiana  each of which constituted the purchase of a business 
no such business acquisitions were made in in addition  in  we realized million of cash from the sale of golf courses 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used million of cash in our financing activities during  as compared to million of cash used during the increase in the cash used in financing activities during was related to net repayments ie  repayments net of borrowings of million related to our debt collateralized by notes receivable during  compared to net repayments of million during the securitization debt is repaid as mortgage payments are received on the notes receivable that serve as collateral for the debt 
the net repayments of notes receivable backed debt in reflect the consolidation of securitization debt as a result of adopting asu and asu effective january  additionally  we entered into two securitization transactions during for gross proceeds of million  of which was used to pay down the company s existing receivables purchase facility with bb t 
in addition  we repaid million under our lines of credit and notes payable during  compared to net repayments of million during for additional information on the availability of cash from our existing credit facilities as well as our repayment obligations  see liquidity and capital resources below 
we used million of cash in our financing activities during  as compared to million of cash generated during in  we borrowed million and repaid million of debt under our various receivable backed notes payable  lines of credit and other notes payable 
this compares to borrowings of million and repayments of million under such debt instruments during in addition  net cash flows from financing activities for the period were reduced by the repayment of our million senior secured notes on march  see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of our financing activities 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our residual interests in such transactions  iv cash from our finance operations  including principal and interest payments received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois and homesites and mortgage servicing fees  and v net cash generated from our sales and marketing fee based services and other resort fee based services  including our resorts management operations  and other communities operations 
sales of vois accounted for of our system wide sales during as a result of initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of  we have in recent years realized higher down payments and a higher percentage of cash sales in connection with voi sales compared to prior years 
including down payments received on financed sales  of our voi sales were paid in cash within approximately days from the contract date 
while the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive  our principal goals in the current environment are to emphasize the generation of free cash flow defined as cash flow from operating and investing activities by i incentivizing our sales associates to generate higher percentages of our sales in cash compared to historical levels  ii maintaining sales volumes that allow us to focus on what we believe to be the most efficient marketing channels available to us  iii minimizing capital and inventory expenditures  and iv utilizing our sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  resort management services  title and construction expertise to pursue fee based service business relationships that require minimal up front capital investment and have the potential to produce strong cash flows for us 
historically  our business model has depended on the availability of credit in the commercial markets 
voi sales are generally dependent upon us providing financing to our buyers 
our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of to of the purchase price in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing  and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily cash expenses that generally exceed the buyer s minimum required down payment 
accordingly  having financing facilities available for the hypothecation  sale  or transfer of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor in our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
historically  we have relied on our ability to sell receivables in the term securitization market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in our receivable facilities 
in addition  maintaining adequate voi inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has historically required us to incur debt for the acquisition  construction and development of new resorts 
although we believe that we currently have adequate completed vois in inventory to satisfy our needs for the next several years  and therefore  expect acquisition and development expenditures to remain at current levels in the near future  we may decide to acquire or develop more inventory in the future  which would increase our acquisition and development expenditures and may require us to incur additional debt 
during  we successfully renewed and extended several of our existing credit facilities 
we also entered into a million timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with national bank of arizona and a million timeshare receivables purchase facility with quorum federal credit union 
additionally  we successfully completed two securitization transactions 
in september of  we securitized million of the lowest fico score loans previously financed by the bb t purchase facility for gross proceeds of million and in december of  we securitized an additional million of our higher fico score loans for gross proceeds of million  a portion of which was used to repay all amounts then outstanding under the company s existing receivables purchase facility with bb t 
the challenging credit markets have negatively impacted our financing activities in recent years 
while the credit markets appear to be recovering and we consummated term securitizations and entered into new financing facilities during  the number of banks and other finance companies willing to provide warehouse lines of credit for timeshare receivables has decreased 
there is no assurance that we will be able to renew our existing receivable backed lines of credit when their current advance periods expire or secure new future financing for our voi notes receivable on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the securitization market has become unavailable for extended periods of time in the past and there can be no assurances that it will not become unavailable to us in the future 
further  while we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations or repay outstanding debt  there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if our efforts are unsuccessful  our liquidity would be significantly adversely impacted 
in light of the current trading price of our common stock  financing involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
our levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i our significant cash requirements to service debt reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as conditions in the credit markets  generally  ii our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures  credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments  or pay cash dividends on or repurchase common stock  and iv our leverage position may limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
certain of our financing arrangements materially limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock or our ability to repurchase shares in the near term 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
credit facilities the following is a discussion of our material purchase and credit facilities  including those that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to a significant credit facility  and capital leases

we have received a term sheet to amend our existing national bank of arizona nba facility to allow us to pledge additional timeshare receivables up to the borrowing limit  with the additional advances not to exceed million 
there can be no assurance that we will close on this amendment on favorable terms  if at all 
in february  we revised the terms of and extended the revolving advance period of the liberty bank facility with certain existing participants in the liberty led syndicate 
in addition to the million outstanding to the extending participants reflected in this table  an additional million is outstanding as of february  to the other participants 
this amount outstanding to the other participants does not reduce the availability under the extended liberty bank facility 
see other outstanding receivable backed notes payable below for further information regarding the terms of this amendment and extension 
interest charged on this facility is subject to a floor of interest charged on this facility is subject to a floor of bb t purchase facility 
we have a million timeshare notes receivable purchase facility with branch banking and trust company bb t the bb t purchase facility 
the bb t purchase facility provides a revolving advance period through december  the interest rates on future advances under the facility are the prime rate plus  subject to tiered increases once the outstanding balance equals or exceeds million  with a maximum interest rate of the prime rate plus  once the facility equals or exceeds million

the bb t purchase facility provides for the financing of our timeshare receivables at an advance rate of  subject to the terms of the facility 
while ownership of the receivables is transferred for legal purposes  the transfers of receivables under the facility are accounted for as secured borrowings 
accordingly  the receivables are reflected as assets and the associated obligations are reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the bb t purchase facility is nonrecourse and is not guaranteed by us 
as of december   the entire million facility was available to be drawn upon  subject to eligible collateral and what we believe to be customary terms and conditions 
quorum facility 
on december   we entered into a new timeshare receivables purchase facility the quorum facility with quorum federal credit union quorum 
the quorum facility allows for the sale of timeshare notes receivable on a non recourse basis  pursuant to the terms of the facility and subject to certain conditions precedent 
quorum has agreed to purchase eligible timeshare receivables from us or certain of our subsidiaries up to an aggregate million purchase price through december  the terms of the quorum facility reflect an advance rate and a program fee rate of per annum through august   and terms to be agreed upon through december  eligibility requirements for receivables sold include  amongst others  that the obligors under the timeshare notes receivable sold be members of quorum at the time of the note sale 
the quorum facility contemplates the ability of quorum to purchase additional receivables subject to advance rates  fees and other terms to be agreed upon from time to time over and above the initial million commitment  pursuant to the terms of the facility and subject to certain conditions precedent 
subject to performance of the collateral  we will receive all of the excess cash flows generated by the receivables transferred to quorum under the facility excess meaning after customary payment of fees and return of amounts invested by quorum under the facility on a pro rata basis as borrowers make payments on their timeshare loans 
other outstanding receivable backed notes payable we have outstanding obligations under various receivable backed credit facilities that have no remaining future availability as the advance periods have expired

as of december   we had a million revolving timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with a syndicate of lenders led by liberty bank and assembled by wellington financial liberty bank facility 
during  we pledged million of voi notes receivable to this facility and received cash proceeds of million 
we also repaid million on the facility 
as of december   we had no availability under the facility as the revolving advance period has expired 
in february  we revised the terms of and extended the liberty bank facility 
the revised million facility new liberty bank facility provides for an advance on eligible receivables pledged under the facility during a two year period ending in february  subject to terms and conditions we believe to be customary for transactions of this type 
availability under the new liberty bank facility is reduced by amounts currently outstanding to certain syndicate participants under the existing liberty bank facility 
at february   the date of the transaction  such currently outstanding amounts under the existing liberty bank facility were approximately million  therefore  initial availability under the new liberty bank facility was approximately million  but as outstanding amounts on the existing facility amortize over time  the new liberty bank facility will revolve up to million  subject to eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions 
principal and interest will be paid as cash is collected on the pledged receivables  with the remaining balance due in february indebtedness under the new liberty bank facility bears interest at the prime rate plus  subject to a floor of

the following tables summarize the contractual minimum principal and interest payments  respectively  net of unamortized discount  required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases by period date  as of december   in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures noncancelable operating leases total contractual obligations legacy securitization payments included in the receivable backed notes payable after years are presented net of a discount of million 
we estimate that the cash required to satisfy our development obligations related to resort buildings and resort amenities was approximately million as of december  we estimate that the cash required to satisfy our development obligations related to communities was approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made pursuant to a sales contract with a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next three to ten years  primarily with cash generated from operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete these commitments or that actual costs will not exceed the amounts estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we intend to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements  including the contractual payment of the obligations set forth above  for the foreseeable future  subject to the successful implementation of ongoing strategic initiatives and receivable backed credit facility extensions discussed above and the ongoing availability of credit 
we will continue our efforts to renew  extend or replace any credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we may  in the future  also obtain additional credit facilities and may issue corporate debt or equity securities 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include what we believe to be customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  and transactions with affiliates  as well as covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements  cash balances and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants  that we will be successful in obtaining waivers  or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
further  although we do not currently believe that any such transactions currently are  or are likely to be  structured so as to materially limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock or our ability to repurchase shares in the near term  there is no assurance this will remain true in the future 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and changing prices risk we believe that inflation and changing prices have had a material impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we have increased the sales prices of our vois periodically and have experienced increased construction and development costs from time to time during the last several years 
there is no assurance that we will be able to increase or maintain the current level of our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our vois adversely impacts consumer demand  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
while we have previously reduced sales prices of our homesites in response to low levels of consumer demand  these same factors may continue to affect our bluegreen communities segment in the future 
foreign currency risk during  our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars represented approximately and less than of our consolidated revenues and our consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
to the extent inflationary trends  tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates  our debt service costs may increase 
if interest rates increased or decreased one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be an annual increase or a decrease of approximately million  based on december  balances 
a similar change in interest rates would affect the total fair value of our fixed rate debt by an immaterial amount 
this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could result due to interest rate changes 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
