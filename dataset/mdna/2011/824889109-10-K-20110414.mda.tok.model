item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this report 
overview of our business shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states primarily in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our marketing effort targets moderate income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers to serve themselves  if they choose 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year is a week year ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to years  and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   january   and january  executive summary fiscal for fiscal  our consistent  positive quarterly execution enabled us to generate the highest annual comparable store sales and earnings in our history 
we were able to take advantage of increased consumer demand for footwear  particularly in sandals  boots and toning footwear 
our strong sales performance in each quarter  when combined with higher gross profit margins and controlled expenses  produced record annual results 
q achieved an all time quarterly record of per diluted share 
q achieved record second quarter earnings per diluted share of q achieved record third quarter earnings per diluted share of 
this represented the highest third quarter earnings in our history and the second highest all time quarterly earnings  trailing only the earnings per diluted share achieved in the first quarter of fiscal q achieved fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of 
this represented the second highest fourth quarter earnings in our history  trailing only the earnings per diluted share achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was a week quarter 
on an annual basis comparable store sales increased 
this represented the highest annual comparable store sales growth in the history of shoe carnival 
our sales gains were largely driven by an increase in the number of footwear units sold  as the consumer responded favorably to our assortment of footwear 
we recorded comparable store sales gains in each major merchandise category 
our gross profit margin increased to from for fiscal our merchandise margin increased 
buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased  as a percentage of sales  due to the leverage associated with the comparable store sales increase 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior fiscal year 
the per diluted share represented the highest annual earnings in our history 
we ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents and no interest bearing debt 
inventories at january  when compared to the end of the prior year  increased million 
approximately half of this increase was attributable to an increase in inventory levels of toning product 
while the average unit price obtained for this style of footwear has declined since its original introduction last year  we do not believe that the sale of this product during fiscal will have a material impact on our overall gross profit margin 
excluding toning product  the increase in inventory was in line with our non toning sales trend 
we opened ten new stores and relocated three stores 
additionally  we remodeled approximately of our store locations  which coincided with lease renewal activities 
fiscal in fiscal  we expect comparable store sales to increase in the low single digits 
additionally  we will be launching an e commerce site during the second half of the year to sell shoes and related accessories through our website  www 
shoecarnival 
com 
we will continue to be cautious with our inventories and selling  general and administrative expenses 
capital expenditures will reflect our return to a more normalized new store growth rate and an accelerated store remodel plan 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to rise moderately  primarily due to store growth 
capital expenditures are expected to increase million to million primarily due to returning to a more normalized new store growth rate  relocating stores to better locations in existing markets and increasing the rate of remodeling of existing stores 
we anticipate opening approximately stores  relocating nine and closing five 
we are targeting approximately of our store locations for remodel activities 
the remodels at the majority of these locations are being performed to coincide with lease renewal activities 
by controlling the growth in our expense structure  inventories and capital expenditures in fiscal  we anticipate having positive free cash flow for the year 
this would be our eighth consecutive year of positive free cash flow 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results 
these judgments involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgments are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically review our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the expected future cash flows to be derived from their use 
we conduct our reviews at the lowest identifiable level 
our stores are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis 
if the expected future cash flows related to the long lived assets are less than the assets carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets using company specific assumptions  which would fall within level of the fair value hierarchy 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes we calculate income taxes and account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with current authoritative guidance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we are also required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves we use a combination of self insurance and third party insurance for workers compensation  employee medical and general liability insurance 
these plans have stop loss provisions that protect us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
we will continue to evaluate our self insured liabilities and the underlying assumptions on a quarterly basis and make adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
in the event we determine an accrual should be increased or reduced  we will record such adjustments in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  an increase from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales increased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the ten stores opened in fiscal  along with the effect of a full year worth of sales from the stores opened in fiscal  contributed an additional million in sales 
these sales increases were partially offset by the million of sales lost from the stores that were closed during fiscal and fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased  primarily as a result of the strong sales of seasonal footwear 
buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased  as a percentage of sales  due to the leverage associated with comparable store sales increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by  as a percentage of sales 
while we were able to significantly leverage our store operating expenses as a percentage of sales  we did incur an additional million in store selling expenses as compared to the prior year 
the increase in store selling expenses was primarily due to increases in wages  advertising and credit and debit card processing fees  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation 
incentive compensation  inclusive of stock based compensation  increased million when compared to the prior year due to our improved financial performance 
also during fiscal  we recorded an additional million in store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges related to certain underperforming stores 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in our self insured health care costs as compared to the prior year when we experienced unusually high claim activity 
the costs related to our self insured health care programs are subject to a certain degree of volatility and can vary materially between reporting periods 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  compared to  or of sales  in fiscal we opened ten stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store increased by  to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of additional expenditures on marketing and supplies 
the portion of store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of seven stores  the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal  we incurred  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of nine stores  the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal included in income tax expense for fiscal was a  income tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions 
this cumulative benefit significantly lowered our effective income tax rate for fiscal as compared to the same period last year 
compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales increased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the stores opened in fiscal  along with the effect of a full year worth of sales from the stores opened in fiscal  contributed an additional million in sales 
these sales increases were partially offset by the million of sales lost from the stores that were closed during fiscal and fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  an increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased compared to the prior year  and buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased 
through tight control of inventories  we were able to reduce the level of promotional selling on a year over year basis 
this  along with strong sales of boots and athletic footwear  positively affected our merchandise margin 
the leverage on our buying  distribution and occupancy costs was the result of the sales increase combined with a  decrease in expenses  primarily due to cost saving initiatives in distribution logistics 
while additional occupancy costs were incurred for the operation of our new stores  these increases were largely offset by rent reductions on certain comparable stores and the elimination of rent from the stores closed during fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by  as a percentage of sales 
incentive compensation increased million on a year over year basis due to our improved financial performance 
expenses related to employee benefits increased million 
this increase was associated with our non qualified deferred compensation plan  which experienced an increase in value as a result of the rebound from the fiscal broad based decline in the stock market 
health care costs increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in non cash asset impairments and disposal charges associated with store closings  along with other operational cost savings 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store increased by  to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in advertising 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of nine stores in fiscal and the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in costs related to the closing of stores and the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
interest income and expense  net net interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily as a result of a reduction in interest income 
as returns available on short term investments fell to record lows  we held our excess funds for the first seven months of fiscal in non interest bearing deposit accounts to offset bank service fees  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the increase in rate between the two periods was primarily due to the federal tax rate falling below in fiscal as a result of lower projected income before tax 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows in thousands net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes   lease incentives    changes in operating assets and liabilities   other operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities  net increase in cash and cash equivalents  our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at january  this was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million increase in merchandise inventories 
the current ratio was at january  and was at january  we had no outstanding interest bearing debt at the end of either fiscal year 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was used for new stores and million was used for remodeling and store relocation activities 
as part of our long term growth strategy and to increase our distribution capabilities  we redesigned certain elements of the material handling system in our distribution center 
during fiscal  we spent million to complete these modifications 
the remaining capital expenditures for fiscal were used for continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
lease incentives received from landlords were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal we intend to open approximately stores at an expected total cost of million  to relocate nine stores at an expected total cost of million  and to remodel of our stores at an expected cost of million 
lease incentives to be received from landlords are expected to be approximately million to million  with approximately  being received in the form of credits taken against rent payments 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for various other store improvements  the implementation of an e commerce platform  continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  with landlord incentives averaging  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal this represents an  increase over our average fiscal expenditure 
on a per store basis  for the ten stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged we closed seven stores during fiscal we have identified five stores for closure in fiscal and one for fiscal depending upon the results of lease negotiations with certain landlords of underperforming stores  we may increase or decrease the number of store closures in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
we will continue to review our annual store growth rate based on our view of the internal and external opportunities and challenges in the marketplace 
significant contractual obligations as of january  and the fiscal years in which payments are due include in thousands payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total after letters of credit   operating leases     purchase commitments   unrecognized tax positions deferred compensation   total contractual obligations   our unsecured credit agreement provides for up to million in cash advances and commercial and standby letters of credit with borrowing limits based on eligible inventory 
it contains covenants which stipulate total shareholders equity  adjusted for the effect of any share repurchases  will not fall below that of the prior fiscal year end  the ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent will not exceed to  and cash dividends for a fiscal year will not exceed of consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of january  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at january  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit provides for frequent borrowing and or repayment activities  which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
for purposes of our contractual obligations table above  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date 
we have disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
except for operating leases  the balances included in the and after column of the contractual obligations table includes amounts where we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments 
see note long term debt  note leases  note income taxes and note employee benefit plans to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a further discussion of our contractual obligations 
on august   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which will terminate upon the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  the purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in accordance with applicable laws  rules and regulations 
the program may be amended  suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we intend to fund the share repurchase program from cash on hand and any shares acquired will be available for stock based compensation awards and other corporate purposes 
the actual number and value of the shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price and other market conditions 
as required by our credit agreement  consent was obtained from the agent and the majority banks  each as defined in the credit agreement 
no shares had been repurchased under this program as of january  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion along with other capital expenditures and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on two assignments of operating leases covering former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of january  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for the assignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or january  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies  contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
we had no borrowings under our credit facility during fiscal or fiscal
