table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
fair valuation of financial instruments the company adopted financial accounting standards board asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  on january  this standard provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance within the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level 
fair value determination requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc  financial instruments 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and  when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 

table of contents for current broker prices obtained on certain investment securities that we believe are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in inactive markets  we have determined that each of these securities will be individually examined for the appropriate valuation methodology 
the valuation methodology is based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and a discounted cash flow approach 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company made assumptions related to the implied rate of return  general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premium  specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security  as well as taking into consideration broker discount rates in determining the discount rate 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  a credit related impairment loss is recognized in current earnings 
noncredit related impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors are examined to assess impairment which include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we take into consideration the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for its portfolio of trust preferred securities 
the company considers factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  expected defaults  the financial condition of the issuer s  and the value of any underlying collateral 
acquired loans acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with asc  business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are accounted for under asc  receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
further  the company elected to account for all other acquired loans within the scope of asc using the same methodology 
under asc and asc  loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
in situations where loans have similar risk characteristics  loans were aggregated into pools to estimate cash flows under asc a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate  cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation 
the company aggregated all of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisitions of wfib and ucb into different pools  based on common risk characteristics 
the cash flows expected over the life of the pools are estimated using an internal cash flow model that projects cash flows and calculates the carrying values of the pools  book yields  effective interest income and impairment  if any  based on pool level events 
assumptions as to cumulative loss rates  loss curves and prepayment speeds are utilized to calculate the expected cash flows 

table of contents under asc  the excess of the expected cash flows at acquisition over the fair value is considered to be the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loan or pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over the expected cash flows is considered to be the nonaccretable difference 
subsequent to the acquisition date  any increases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date in excess of fair value are recorded as an adjustment to accretable difference on a prospective basis 
any subsequent decreases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses 
any disposals of loans  including sales of loans  payments in full or foreclosures result in the removal of the loan from the asc portfolio at the carrying amount 
covered loans the majority of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisitions of washington first international bank and united commercial bank are included in the fdic shared loss agreements and are referred to as covered loans 
covered loans are reported exclusive of the expected cash flow reimbursements expected from the fdic 
at the date of acquisition  all covered loans were accounted for under asc and asc subsequent to acquisition all covered loans are accounted for under asc covered other real estate owned all other real estate owned acquired in the fdic assisted acquisitions of wfib and ucb as well as subsequent foreclosure on covered loans are included in the fdic shared loss agreements and are referred to as covered other real estate owned 
covered other real estate owned is reported exclusive of expected reimbursement cash flows from the fdic 
upon transferring covered loan collateral to covered other real estate owned status  acquisition date fair value discounts on the related loan are also transferred to covered other real estate owned 
fair value adjustments on covered other real estate owned result in a reduction of the covered other real estate carrying amount and a corresponding increase in the estimated fdic reimbursement  with the estimated net loss to the bank charged against earnings 
fdic indemnification asset in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisitions of washington first international bank and united commercial bank  the bank entered into shared loss agreements with the fdic for amounts receivable covered by the shared loss agreements 
at the date of the acquisition the company elected to account for amounts receivable under the shared loss agreements as an indemnification asset in accordance with asc subsequent to the acquisition the indemnification asset is tied to the loss in the covered loans and is not being accounted for under fair value 
the fdic indemnification asset is accounted for on the same basis as the related covered loans and is the present value of the cash flows the company expects to collect from the fdic under the shared loss agreements 
the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flow the company expects to collect from the fdic is accreted into noninterest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset 
the fdic indemnification asset is adjusted for any changes in expected cash flows based on the loan performance 
any increases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will reduce the fdic indemnification asset and any decreases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will increase the fdic indemnification asset 
increase and decreases to the fdic indemnification asset are recorded as adjustments to noninterest income 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries  size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
for a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodology see management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses presented elsewhere in this report 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and changing credit environment 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 

table of contents other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or through full or partial satisfaction of loans  is considered held for sale  and is recorded at the estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure 
loan balances in excess of fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed as deemed necessary by management and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo below the carrying value are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance by charges to noninterest expense 
any subsequent operating expenses or income of such properties are charged to noninterest expense 
if the oreo is sold shortly after it is received in a foreclosure ie  the holding period was deemed minimal  the company substitutes the value received in the sale net of costs to sell for the fair value less costs to sell 
any adjustment made to the loss originally recognized at the time of foreclosure is then charged against or credited to the allowance for loan losses  if deemed material 
otherwise  any declines in value  after foreclosure  are recorded as gains or losses from the sale or disposition or write down of the real estate 
revenue recognition upon disposition of a property is dependent on the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial investment in the property sold 
loan  oreo and note sales the bank is able and willing to provide financing for entities purchasing loans or oreo assets from the bank 
our general guideline is to seek a down payment as a percentage of the purchase price from the buyer 
we will consider lower down payments when this is not possible  however  accounting rules require certain minimum down payments if these new seller financing loans are to be considered accrual loans on our books 
the minimum down payment varies by the type of underlying real estate collateral 
for note sales where we provide financing  in addition to the required adequate down payment  the sales agreements generally call for guarantees or other forms of borrower recourse 
goodwill impairment under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s two major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  a combined income approach and market approach was used 
under the income approach  the company provided a net income projection and a terminal growth rate was used to calculate the discounted cash flows and the present value of the reporting units 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the current fair values of comparable peer banks of similar size  geographic footprint and focus 
the market capitalizations and multiples of these peer banks were used to calculate the market price of the company and each reporting unit 
the fair value was also subject to a control premium adjustment  which is the cost savings that a purchase of the reporting unit could achieve by eliminating duplicative costs 
under the combined income and market approach  the value from each approach was appropriately weighted to determine the fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income

share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of asc  equity  and asc  compensation stock compensation 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted these standards  as required  on january  prior to  we recognized stock based compensation expense for employee share based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure requirements of asc 
table of contents we adopted asc and asc using the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of these standards apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosures under asc we grant nonqualified stock options and restricted stock 
most of our stock option and restricted stock awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to for the purposes of our pro forma disclosures under asc we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
for the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
wfib acquisition on june  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of washington first international bank from the fdic in an fdic assisted transaction 
as part of the wfib purchase and assumption agreement  the bank and the fdic entered into shared loss agreements  whereby the fdic will cover a substantial portion of any future losses on loans and related unfunded loan commitments  oreo and accrued interest on loans for up to days 
under the terms of the shared loss agreements  the fdic will absorb of losses and share in of loss recoveries 
the shared loss agreements for commercial and single family residential mortgage loans are in effect for years and years  respectively  from the june  acquisition date and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for years and years  respectively  from the acquisition date 
the bank purchased assets with fair values of approximately million in loans  million of cash and cash equivalents  million in investment securities  million in other real estate owned and million of other assets of washington first international bank from the fdic

the increase in non covered loans was primarily driven by a decrease of million  or  in land and construction loans  offset by an increase of million  or  in commercial business and trade finance loans 
as of december   we classified million of loans as held for sale  primarily comprised of student loans 
covered loans totaled billion at december   as compared to billion at december  the decrease in the covered loan portfolio was mainly due to paydowns  payoffs and charge off activity 

table of contents the covered loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans acquired from the fdic assisted acquisition of ucb which are covered under loss share agreements with the fdic 
after actively managing the ucb covered loan portfolio for approximately one year  we have resolved many problem loans and concluded that the credit quality is performing better than originally estimated 
as such  we lowered the credit discount on the ucb covered loan portfolio in the fourth quarter 
our original credit discount on the ucb covered loan balance was approximately and we have now reduced this to approximately 
by lowering the credit discount  interest income will increase over the life of the loans 
correspondingly  with the lowered credit discount  the expected reimbursement from the fdic under the loss sharing agreement will also decrease  resulting in amortization on the fdic indemnification asset which is recorded as a charge to noninterest income 
the net decrease in the fdic indemnification asset resulting from loan disposition activity and amortization of the indemnification asset was million in noninterest expense totaled million for the full year  or million higher than this increase from was largely due to our increased size from the acquisitions of ucb and wfib and due to expenses incurred on covered assets

operating segment results for fiscal years and prior  we had previously identified five operating segments for purposes of management reporting retail banking  commercial lending  treasury  residential lending  and other 
our strategic focus has been shifting and evolving over the last several years which has influenced how our chief operating decision maker views the company s business operations and assesses its economic performance 
for the bank  the chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer ceo 
specifically  our business focus has culminated in a two segment core business structure retail banking and commercial banking 
a third segment  which is comprised of a combination of our previous operating segments treasury and other  provides broad administrative support to these two core segments 
as a result of this evolution in our strategic focus  we realigned our segment methodology during the first quarter of  and identified these three business divisions as meeting the criteria of an operating segment 
during the fourth quarter of  a fourth operating segment  the united commercial bank segment the ucb segment was identified as a result of the ucb acquisition 
during the first quarter of  the company s management made the decision to fully integrate the ucb segment into its two segment core business structure retail banking and commercial banking 
with this integration  effective the first quarter of  the company s business focus reverted back to a three segment core business structure retail banking  commercial banking and other 
the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network 
the commercial banking segment  which includes commercial real estate  primarily generates commercial loans through the efforts of the commercial lending offices located in the bank s northern and southern california production offices 
furthermore  the commercial banking segment also offers a wide variety of international finance and trade services and products 
the former residential lending segment has been combined with the retail banking segment due to the consumer centric nature of the products and services offered by these two segments as well as the synergistic relationship between these two units in generating consumer mortgage loans 
the remaining centralized functions  including the former treasury segment and eliminations of intersegment amounts have been aggregated and included in other 
changes in our management structure or reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results 
results for prior periods are generally restated for comparability for changes in management structure or reporting methodologies unless it is not deemed practicable to do so 
given the significant decline in short term and long term interest rates since  we reassessed our transfer pricing assumptions during the first quarter of to be consistent with the company s strategic goal of growing core deposits and originating profitable  good credit quality loans 
changes to our funds transfer pricing assumptions were made with the intent to promote core deposit growth and  given our recent credit experience  to better reflect the current risk profiles of various loan categories within our credit portfolio 
our transfer pricing assumptions and methodologies are reviewed at least annually to ensure that our process is reflective of current market conditions 
our transfer pricing process is formulated with the goal of incenting loan and deposit growth that is consistent with the company s overall growth objectives as well as to provide a reasonable and consistent basis for measurement of our business segments and product net interest margins 
changes to our transfer pricing assumptions and methodologies are approved by the asset liability committee 

table of contents the changes in transfer pricing assumptions that we implemented during the first quarter of have not been reflected in the segment results for since these changes were adopted on a prospective basis 
we have  however  performed a high level assessment of the impact of these transfer pricing assumption changes to the various operating segments 
based on this assessment  we determined that the full year impact of these changes was not significant overall  and would have been favorable to the segment pre tax profit loss results for the retail banking and commercial banking segments but unfavorable to the other segment during additionally  the changes in transfer pricing assumptions implemented during the first quarter of would not have altered the conclusion of our goodwill impairment test performed as of december   had these assumptions been retroactively implemented during for more information about our segments  including information about the underlying accounting and reporting process  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
retail banking the retail banking segment reported a million pre tax loss during  compared to a million pre tax loss for  an improvement of million 
the improvement for this segment was largely due to a million or increase in net interest income  million or decrease in the loan loss provision and a million or increase in noninterest income 
these increases of income were partly offset by an million or increase in noninterest expense 
net interest income for this segment increased to million during  compared to million for the increase in net interest income during is attributable to the increase in total loans receivable resulting from the wfib and ucb acquisitions 
the decrease in loan loss provisions for this segment during relative to was due to decreased charge off activity 
loan loss provisions are also impacted by average loan balances for each reporting segment 
noninterest income for this segment increased  to million for  from million in the increase in noninterest income is primarily due to an increase in loan and branch related fees and a gain on sale of student loans 
noninterest expense for this segment increased to million during  compared with million during the increase in noninterest expense is primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expenses  amortization of intangibles and oreo operations

the pre tax profit for this segment is primarily due to a significant decrease in the loan loss provision of million or to million during  compared with million for  resulting from decreased charge off activity 
the profit was also driven in part by a million or increase in net interest income  offset by a million or decrease in noninterest income and an million or increase in noninterest expense 
net interest income for this segment increased to million during  compared to million for the increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase in total loans receivable resulting from the wfib and ucb acquisitions 
noninterest income for this segment decreased to a loss of million during  compared with income of million recorded in the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to the reduction in the fdic indemnification asset and receivable from the covered portfolio acquired from wfib and ucb 
noninterest expense for this segment increased to million during  compared with million recorded during the increase in noninterest expense during is due primarily to an increase in compensation and employee benefits  oreo operations  and loan and legal expenses 

table of contents comparing to  the commercial banking segment reported a pre tax loss of million during  or a  increase  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the pre tax loss for this segment is due to a significant increase in loan loss provisions  million  resulting from increased charge off activity

year over year  loan loss provisions increased to million or during  compared with million for other this segment reported a pre tax profit of million during  compared with a pre tax profit of million recorded in  a change of million or

comparing to  the other segment s pre tax income improved to a pre tax profit of million in  compared to a pre tax loss of million in the primary driver of the increase in pre tax income for this segment in is a million increase in noninterest income primarily from the million pre tax gain recorded on the ucb acquisition during the fourth quarter of balance sheet analysis total assets increased million  or  to billion as of december  the increase is comprised predominantly of increases in cash and cash equivalents of million  securities purchased under resale agreements of million  available for sale investment securities of million  loans held for sale of million  oreo of million  and premises and equipment of million offset primarily by decreases in net loans receivable of million  fdic indemnification asset and receivable of million  short term investments of and other changes in assets 
the increase in total assets was funded primarily through increases in deposit growth of million 
investment securities income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  us government sponsored enterprise and other mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  and corporate debt securities 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are recorded based on their amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of stockholders equity 
all investment securities have been classified as available for sale as of december  and december  total investment securities available for sale increased to billion as of december   compared with billion at december  the increase in investment securities was primarily funded by deposit growth 
total repayments maturities and proceeds from sales of investment securities amounted to billion and billion  respectively  during proceeds from repayments  maturities  sales  and redemptions were applied towards additional investment securities purchases totaling billion 
we recorded net gains totaling million and million on sales of investment securities during and  respectively 
at december   investment securities available for sale with a par value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  frb discount window  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 

table of contents we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  a credit related impairment loss is recognized in current earnings 
noncredit related impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on factors including the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and our ability and intent to not sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
for securities that are determined to not have other than temporary declines in value  we have both the ability and the intent to hold these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and  when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
as a result of the global financial crisis and illiquidity in the us markets  the market for these securities has been inactive since mid it is the company s view that current broker prices which are typically non binding on the private label mortgage backed security and certain pooled trust preferred securities are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets that are not representative of the fair value of these securities 
as such  the company considered what weight  if any  to place on transactions that are not orderly when estimating fair value 
we have six individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer as of december  these securities are comprised of five pooled trust preferred securities with a total fair value of million and one mortgage backed security with a total fair value of million 
the company recorded other than temporary impairment losses in of million and million  respectively  for these securities 
the majority of unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio at december  are related to agency securities that have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months 
as of december   the company had billion in agency securities available for sale  representing approximately of the total investment securities available for sale portfolio

non covered nonperforming assets loans are continually monitored by management and the board of directors 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days or the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectability of the loan

we evaluate loan impairment according to the provisions of asc  receivables overall subsequent measurement 
under asc  loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
also  in accordance with asc  loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses required for the period 
at december   the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  compared with million at december  the decrease in impaired loans is largely due to a decrease in nonperforming land loans 
all nonaccrual and doubtful loans are included in impaired loans 
impaired loans at december  are comprised of single family loans totaling million  multifamily loans totaling million  income producing commercial real estate loans totaling million  cre construction loans totaling million  cre land loans totaling million  commercial business loans totaling million and other consumer loans totaling thousand

allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we perform an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is increased or decreased by the amount of net recoveries or charge offs  respectively  during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  which includes million allocated to covered loans 
prior to the third quarter of  the total allowance was allocated to non covered loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses on non covered loans amounted to million  or of total non covered loans receivable  compared with million  or of total non covered loans receivable  at december  the million decrease in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions  less million in net charge offs recorded during the year

the migration analysis looks at pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period 
we utilize historical loss factors derived from trends and losses associated with each pool over a specified period of time 
based on this process  we assign loss factors to each loan grade within each pool of loans 
loss rates derived by the migration model are based predominantly on historical loss trends that may not be indicative of the actual or inherent loss potential 
as such  we utilize qualitative and environmental factors as adjusting mechanisms to supplement the historical results of the classification migration model 
qualitative considerations include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic or market conditions  relative risk profiles of various loan segments  volume concentrations  growth trends  delinquency and nonaccrual status  problem loan trends  and geographic concentrations 
qualitative and environmental factors are reflected as percent adjustments and are added to the historical loss rates derived from the classified asset migration model to determine the appropriate allowance amount for each loan pool

table of contents asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans and securities 
in addition  government programs  such as the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash inflows from operating activities were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash inflows outflows from investing activities totaled million  billion  and million during   and  respectively 
net cash inflows from investing activities for and were due primarily to repayment  redemption and sales of investment securities offset by purchases of investment securities 
for  net cash outflows from investing activities can be attributed primarily to purchases of investment securities 
these factors were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment securities and loans  as well as repayments  maturities and redemptions of investment securities 
we experienced net cash outflows from financing activities of million during the year ended december   primarily due to repayment of fhlb advances 
during  we had net cash outflows from financing activities of billion primarily due to repayment of short term borrowings 
during  we had net cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to million net proceeds received from the issuance of series a and series b preferred stock during april and december  respectively  as well as the net increase in deposits 
as a result of the turbulence in the banking sector  we experienced a notable growth in deposit products that afford greater deposit insurance coverage to deposit customers during the second half of as of december   time deposits within the cdars program increased to million  compared to million at december  the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain full coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we partnered with another financial institution to implement a new retail sweep product for non time deposit accounts to provide added deposit insurance coverage for deposits in excess of fdic insured limits 
cash from financing activities were partially offset by net decreases in federal funds purchased and fhlb advances  as well as million of existing cash and cash equivalents to pay cash dividends to our stockholders 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
as of december   we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc has historically been dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to applicable statutes and regulations

table of contents interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a quarterly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a non parallel shift of and basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income net portfolio value volatility volatility change in interest rates basis points december  december  december  december  the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and in a declining rate environment  the interest rate floors on these loans contribute to the favorable impact on our net interest income 
however  in a rising rate environment  these interest rate floors also serve to lessen the full benefit of higher interest rates 
at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 
the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments

thereafter  interest rates become adjustable based on a predetermined index 
expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also use prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing frequencies differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of interest bearing deposits in other banks are based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the bank s time deposit rate curve 
the fair values of short term investments generally approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has reviewed the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
for the private label mortgage backed security  the fair value was derived based on weighted average of broker prices based on market approach and income approach discounted cash flow 
for the pooled trust preferred securities  the fair value was derived based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the discount rate is derived from assumptions using an exit pricing approach related to the implied rate of return which have been adjusted for general changes in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premiums  and specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the securities 

table of contents the fair value of deposits is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve  plus spread  if any 
for core deposits  the cash outflows are projected by the decay rate based on the bank s core deposit premium study 
cash flows for all non time deposits are discounted using the libor yield curve 
for time deposits  the cash flows are based on the contractual runoff and are discounted by the bank s current offering rates  plus spread 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb term advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
customer repurchase agreements  which have maturities ranging from one to three days  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interests rates paid on these instruments are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates the bank would pay for new issuances 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we may elect to use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
currently  derivative instruments do not have a material effect on our operating results or financial position
