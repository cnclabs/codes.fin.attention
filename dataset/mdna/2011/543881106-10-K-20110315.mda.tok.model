overview businesses loral has two segments  satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
loral participates in satellite services operations principally through its ownership interest in telesat 

table of contents satellite manufacturing space systems loral  inc ss l is a designer  manufacturer and integrator of powerful satellites and satellite systems for commercial and government customers worldwide 
ss l s design  engineering and manufacturing capabilities have allowed it to develop a large portfolio of highly engineered  mission critical satellites and secure a strong industry presence 
this position provides ss l with the ability to produce satellites that meet a broad range of customer requirements for broadband internet service to the home  mobile video and internet service  broadcast feeds for television and radio distribution  phone service  civil and defense communications  direct to home television broadcast  satellite radio  telecommunications backhaul and trunking  weather and environment monitoring and air traffic control 
in addition  ss l has applied its design and manufacturing expertise to produce spacecraft subsystems  such as batteries for the international space station  and to integrate government and other add on missions on commercial satellites  which are referred to as hosted payloads 
as of december   ss l had billion in backlog for satellites for customers including intelsat global sa  ses sa  telesat holdings inc  hispasat  sa  echostar corporation  sirius xm satellite radio  terrestar corporation  asia satellite telecommunications co 
ltd  hughes network systems  llc  viasat  inc  eutelsat ictqatar  directv  sat lites mexicanos  sa de sa and asia broadcast satellite 
satellite demand is driven by fleet replacement cycles  increased video  internet and data bandwidth demand and new satellite applications 
ss l expects its future success to derive from maintaining and expanding its share of the satellite construction contracts of its existing customers based on its engineering  technical and manufacturing leadership  its value proposition and record of reliability  the increased demand for new applications requiring high power and capacity satellites such as hdtv  d tv and broadband  and ss l s expansion of governmental contracts based on its record of reliability and experience with fixed price contract manufacturing 
we also expect ss l to benefit from the increased revenues from larger and more complex satellites 
as such  increased revenues as well as system and supply chain management improvements should enable ss l to continue to improve its profitability 
the costs of satellite manufacturing include costs for material  subcontracts  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
due to the long lead times required for certain of our purchased parts  and the desire to obtain volume related price concessions  ss l has entered into various purchase commitments with suppliers in advance of receipt of a satellite order 
ss l s costs for material and subcontracts have been relatively stable and are generally provided by suppliers with which ss l has a long established history 
the number of available suppliers and the cost of qualifying the component for use in a space environment to ss l s unique requirements limit the flexibility and advantages inherent in multiple sourcing options 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 
while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  ss l is initiating a two year infrastructure campaign that will result in capital expenditures over this period of approximately million 
also  over the past several years ss l has modified and expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate an expanded backlog 
ss l can now accommodate as many as nine to satellite awards per year  depending on the complexity and timing of the specific satellites  and can accommodate the integration and test of to satellites at any given time in its palo alto facility 
the expansion has also reduced the company s reliance on outside suppliers for certain rf components and sub assemblies 

table of contents the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of these provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
because the satellite manufacturing industry is highly competitive  buyers have the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  and terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by manufacturers such as ss l 
satellite services loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat  the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once the investment in a satellite is made  the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite is relatively low over the life of the satellite with the exception of in orbit insurance 
telesat has been able to generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long term contracts with some of its customers for all or substantially all of a satellite s life 
historically  this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable 
competition in the satellite services market has been intense in recent years due to a number of factors  including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from terrestrial based communications networks 
at december   telesat had in orbit satellites 
telesat currently has three satellites under construction  all by ss l 
telesat is committed to continuing to provide the strong customer service and focus on innovation and technical expertise that has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on backlog and significant contracted growth  telesat s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow the core business and sell newly launched and existing in orbit satellite capacity  and  in a disciplined manner  use the cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat believes its existing satellite fleet supports a strong combination of existing backlog and revenue growth 
the growth is expected to come from the telstar r estrela do sul satellite  which telesat expects to be launched in mid  the nimiq satellite  which is anticipated to be launched in the first half of  the anik g satellite  which telesat anticipates will be launched in the second half of and the sale of available capacity on its existing satellites 
telesat believes this fleet of satellites provides a solid foundation upon which it will seek to grow its revenues and cash flows 
revenue growth is also expected from the canadian broadband business on the viasat satellite  which telesat has agreed to purchase from loral 
the purchase is expected to be completed in march telesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers  who will commit to a substantial amount of capacity at the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites unless it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such capacity 
telesat anticipates that it will be able to increase revenue without a proportional increase in operating expenses  allowing for profit margin expansion 
the fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth and other growth opportunities  is expected to produce growth in operating income and operating cash flow 

table of contents for  telesat remains focused on increasing utilization of its existing satellites  constructing and launching the satellites it is currently procuring  securing additional customer requirements to support the procurement of additional satellites and maintaining cost and operating discipline 
telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations 
approximately of telesat s revenues received in canada for the year ended december   certain of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
during that same time period  however  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
general telesat s board of directors and shareholders have authorized a process to explore an initial public offering or other strategic alternatives 
to minimize the tax impact to the company  thereby maximizing the benefits to loral shareholders of any strategic transaction that takes the form of a sale  loral will endeavor to structure the sale in the form of a transaction for the parent company 
to accommodate such a structure  loral would first separate ss l and its other remaining non telesat assets 
accordingly  in the event of any such transaction  loral would  prior to the transaction  likely contribute its remaining non telesat assets to ss l and then spin off or sell its interest in ss l or its remaining interest if there has first been an ss l initial public offering 
ss l holdings  inc is a newly formed subsidiary of loral established for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering or spin off of ss l 
ss l holdings  inc previously filed a registration statement with the sec for an initial public offering 
the determination of how loral will proceed with respect to ss l  ie whether to proceed with an initial public offering  spin off  combination of an initial public offering and subsequent spin off  sale or other strategic transaction or no transaction at all  will depend on a number of factors  including the outcome of the telesat process described above and business and market conditions 
there can be no assurance whether or when any transaction involving any or all of loral  telesat or ss l may occur 
we regularly explore and evaluate possible other strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
in  loral agreed to purchase the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite that is currently being constructed by ss l 
the viasat satellite is a high capacity ka band spot beam satellite for broadband services that is scheduled to be launched in mid into the o west longitude orbital location 
loral also entered into an agreement with barrett xplore inc barrett  canada s largest rural broadband provider  to deliver high throughput satellite ka band capacity for broadband services in canada 
under the agreement  barrett agreed to lease from loral the canadian capacity on the viasat satellite and associated gateway services for the expected life of the satellite  projected to commence in and loral agreed to construct and operate four gateways in canada 
approximately million has been invested by loral through december  a portion of these costs was funded by prepayments in from barrett of cad million as required under the agreement 
on march   loral entered into agreements to sell its investment in the canadian broadband business  including the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite  to telesat for million plus reimbursement of approximately million  representing loral s net costs incurred through the closing date 
in addition  if telesat obtains certain supplemental capacity on the payload  loral will be entitled to receive  for four years  one half of any net revenue actually earned by telesat on such supplemental capacity 
this transaction is expected to close in march see note to the financial statements 

table of contents in connection with the telesat transaction  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda see note to the financial statements reflects the results of our business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results unless otherwise noted 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation excluding stock based compensation from ss l phantom stock appreciation rights expected to be settled in cash and directors indemnification expense adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before asset impairment charges  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  other expense  and equity in net income losses of affiliates 
adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  asset impairment charges  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  other expense and equity in net income losses of affiliates 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other income expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 
we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
loral has two segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
our segment reporting data includes unconsolidated affiliates that meet the reportable segment criteria 
the satellite services segment includes of the results reported by telesat for the years ended december   and although we analyze telesat s revenue and expenses under the satellite services segment  we eliminate its results in our consolidated financial statements  where we report our share of telesat s results under the equity method of accounting

table of contents income tax provision during the fourth quarter of  we determined  based on all available evidence  that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit from a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and therefore  a full valuation allowance was no longer required 
we based this determination on cumulative profits generated in recent periods  as well as our current expectation that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax benefit from the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed million of the valuation allowance as a deferred income tax benefit 
for  this benefit was partially offset by a current federal and state income tax provision of million  which included a provision of million to increase our liability for uncertain tax positions  and a deferred tax provision of million for the decrease to our deferred tax asset for federal amt credits  resulting in a net income tax benefit of million on pre tax income of million 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets for capital loss carryovers and certain state tax attributes due to the limited carryforward periods and the character of such attributes

impairment of long lived and intangible assets consists primarily of an impairment charge in to reduce certain orbital slot assets to fair value 
telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
telesat s main currency exposures as of december   lie in its us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt financing 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
we estimated that  after considering the impact of hedges  a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar

critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties and performance incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
estimated amounts for performance incentives and penalties are included in contract value when and to the extent that it is probable such amounts will be paid or received 
performance incentives and penalties relate primarily to on orbit performance of the satellite and early or late delivery of the satellite  although a limited number of contracts include performance incentives and penalties related to mass  payload performance and other items 
satellite construction contracts often include provisions for performance incentives pursuant to which a portion of the contract value typically about is at risk  over the life of the satellite typically years  contingent upon the in orbit performance of the satellite in accordance with contractual specifications 
these performance incentives are structured in two forms i under warranty payback  the customer pays the entire amount of the performance incentives during the period of satellite construction and ii under orbital receivables  the customer makes payments of performance incentives at regular intervals often monthly over the in orbit life of the satellite 

table of contents performance incentives  whether warranty payback or orbital receivables  are included in revenues during the construction period of the satellite 
the amount of performance incentives recorded as revenues is net of i a factor based on past experience to reflect the risk that a portion of the performance incentives will be lost due to non performance and ii in the case of orbital receivables  a discount for the time value of money because the amounts will be collected over the operating life of the satellite 
estimates for performance incentives and penalties are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
changes in estimates are typically the result of schedule changes that affect performance incentives and penalties  changes in contract scope  changes in new business forecasts that can affect the level of overhead allocated to a given contract and changes in estimates on contracts as a result of the complex nature of the satellites we manufacture 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 
billed receivables and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectability of our long term receivables and billed receivables which are included in contracts in process on our consolidated balance sheet 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectability of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statements of operations on billed receivables for the years ended december   and  were nil  million and million  respectively 
at december   and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
performance incentives  whether warranty payback or orbital receivables  are recorded as receivables on our balance sheet as we record the revenues on the satellite during the construction period  which is typically two to three years 
performance incentives structured as warranty payback are included in contracts in process  and orbital receivables  which are collected over the in orbit life of the satellite  are included in long term receivables 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence included in the consolidated statements of operations were million  million and nil for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value measurements us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants 
us gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets at the measurement date 
level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and pricing inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 

table of contents these provisions are applicable to all of our assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  level level level in thousands assets cash equivalents money market funds available for sale securities communications industry derivatives foreign exchange contracts non qualified pension plan assets liabilities derivatives foreign exchange contracts the company does not have any non financial assets or non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis we review the carrying values of our equity method investments when events and circumstances warrant and consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary 
the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available  and may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
an impairment charge would be recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its current fair value and is determined to be other than temporary 
we had no equity method investments measured at fair value at december  taxation loral is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
telesat is subject to tax in canada and other jurisdictions and loral will provide in operating earnings any additional us current or deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed distributions from telesat 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying anticipated statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria 

table of contents the tax effects of an uncertain tax position utp taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to utps in income tax expense 
we recognize the benefit of a utp in the period when it is effectively settled 
previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
evaluating the technical merits of a tax position and determining the benefit to be recognized involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying such evaluation 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain qualified pension and supplemental retirement plans 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   a decrease of basis points from december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
both investment types may include alternative investments which are permitted to be up to of total plan assets 
pension plan assets are managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
we also engage non russell related investment managers through russell  in its role as trustee  to invest pension plan assets 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  for and for for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the lower discount rate 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
in addition  share based payment transactions with nonemployees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model and other models as applicable to estimate the fair value of these stock based awards 
these models require us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the models  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 

table of contents the company estimates expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in each reporting period and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we emerged from bankruptcy on november   and as a result  we did not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption for measuring our stock based awards 
in determining the volatility used in our models  we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry  the nature of those companies  our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors in determining our stock price volatility 
we based our estimate of the average life of a stock based award using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates 
our risk free rate of return assumption for awards was based on term matching  nominal  monthly us treasury constant maturity rates as of the date of grant 
we assumed no dividends during the expected term 
the ss l phantom stock appreciation rights program has been designed to incentivize and reward our employees based on the increase in a synthetically determined value of ss l s equity 
as ss l s common stock has not historically been publicly traded and thus does not have a readily ascertainable market value  its equity value under the program is derived from a formula that calculates equity value based on a multiple of adjusted ebitda plus cash on hand less debt at the end of the relevant year 
each phantom stock appreciation right provides the recipient with the right to receive an amount equal to the increase in our notional stock price over the base price at the date of grant multiplied by the number of phantom stock appreciation rights vested on the applicable vesting date 
the baseline price at each grant date is updated accordingly 
the phantom stock appreciation rights have fixed exercise dates 
as such  the phantom stock appreciation rights are automatically exercised and the value if any is paid out on each vesting date 
the phantom stock appreciation rights may be settled in loral stock or cash at our option 
the number of shares of loral stock to be issued on the vesting date is determined by dividing the sar value by the price per share of loral stock on the vesting date 
accordingly  the ss l phantom sars are accounted for as liability awards and the value of the awards is adjusted quarterly for changes in the value of the award resulting from increases or decreases in actual or forecasted adjusted ebitda for the relevant year 
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represented the amount by which the company s reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities  as of october   the date we adopted fresh start accounting 
our goodwill impairment test resulted in the recording of an impairment charge in for the entire goodwill balance of million 
the company s estimate of the fair value of ss l employed both a comparable public company analysis  which considered the valuation multiples of companies deemed comparable  in whole or in part  to the company and a discounted cash flow analysis that calculated a present value of the projected future cash flows of ss l 
the company considered both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions used in the valuation process 
testing goodwill for impairment requires significant subjective judgments by management 
contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when  in management s opinion  such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 

table of contents accounting standards issued and not yet implemented for discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented  see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources loral as described above  the company s principal assets are of the capital stock of ss l and a economic interest in telesat 
in addition  the company has a economic interest in xtar 
ss l s operations are consolidated in the company s financial statements  while the operations of telesat and xtar are not consolidated but are presented using the equity method of accounting 
the parent company has no debt 
ss l amended and restated its revolving credit facility on december   increasing the facility amount to million  extending the maturity to january  and removing the parent company guarantee 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings and million of letters of credit was outstanding 
telesat has third party debt with financial institutions  and xtar has debt to its llc member  hisdesat  loral s joint venture partner in xtar 
the parent company has not provided a guarantee for the debt of telesat or xtar 
cash is maintained at the parent company  ss l  telesat and xtar to support the operating needs of each respective entity 
the ability of ss l and telesat to pay dividends and management fees in cash to the parent company is governed by applicable covenants relating to the debt at each of those entities and in the case of telesat and xtar by their respective shareholder agreements 
the parent company s cash flow is fairly predictable 
ss l s cash flow  however  is subject to substantial timing fluctuation of receipts and expenditures and is difficult to forecast on a quarter to quarter basis 
a typical satellite production contract takes two to three years to complete 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones which are negotiated for each contract and the timing of milestone receipts does not necessarily match the timing of cash expenditures 
revenues and profits under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  so the timing of revenue recognition and cash receipts do not match  creating fluctuations in certain balance sheet accounts including contracts in process  long term receivables and customer advances 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenues and cash flow 
cash and available credit at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and no debt 
these amounts are substantially unchanged from our positions at december  despite spending approximately million to fund an increase in contract assets and capital expenditures 
adjusted ebitda for the company was approximately million for during  ss l did not borrow any funds under its revolving credit agreement 
as discussed above  the ss l credit agreement was amended and restated on december  to increase the facility from million to million  extend the maturity to january  and eliminate the parent company guarantee 
a million letter of credit sub limit was maintained 
as of december   ss l had borrowing availability of approximately million under the facility after giving effect to approximately million of outstanding letters of credit 
ss l anticipates that over the next months it will be in compliance with all the covenants of the ss l credit agreement and have full availability of the facility 
the amended and restated ss l credit agreement allows for a spin off of ss l from loral or an initial public offering of ss l 

table of contents cash management we have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash 
the policy allows us to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all of our liquidity requirements and to provide a competitive rate of return for similar risk categories of investment 
the policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
we operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks 
we currently invest our cash in several liquid prime aaa money market funds 
the dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund 
orbital receivables as of december   ss l had orbital receivables of approximately million  net of fresh start fair value adjustments of million 
of the gross orbital receivables as of december   approximately million are related to satellites launched and million are related to satellites that are under construction 
this represents an increase in gross orbital receivables of approximately million from december  we anticipate that this orbital receivable asset will continue to grow  deferring the receipt of cash 
we will generate positive cash flow from orbital receivables once principal and interest payments received for the in orbit satellites become greater than the amount being deferred for satellites under construction 
the timing of when we will have positive cash flow from orbital receivables is dependent on a number of factors including the number of new satellite awards with the requirement for orbital incentive payments  the timing of the completion of contracts under construction  interest rates associated with orbital incentive payments  the performance of on orbit satellites and the number of satellites in operation as compared to the number of satellites under construction 
liquidity during  the parent company s unrestricted cash position decreased approximately million to million 
cash was used to fund capital expenditures for the canadian broadband business as well as operating costs 
the parent company received cash from the settlement of insurance claims and also from the exercise of stock options 
the details of the delaware shareholder derivative case relating to the company s sale in of million of preferred stock to certain funds affiliated with mhr are disclosed in note to the financial statements 
the parent company purchased directors and officers liability insurance coverage that provides the company with up to million of coverage of which the insurers had advanced approximately million as of december  the company sought recovery for the additional costs it incurred 
from a cash flow perspective  the parent company paid million in may to the directors affiliated with mhr for indemnification of their defense costs and expenses 
the parent company received million in july from insurers in settlement of approximately million in defense costs and expenses that had previously been denied by the insurers 
in december  the parent company received million of a million insurance settlement with the remaining million received in january as a result of a february court ruling  and assuming no further appeals or that the parent company wins any further appeals  the parent company is entitled to receive an additional million from its insurers 
the parent company also received approximately million net from the exercise of stock options during through march   the parent company used approximately million in connection with required tax payments for the cashless exercises of stock options 
in january  the parent company also received a million dividend from ss l representing a return of cash that was invested in by the parent company 
at the parent company  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund projected expenditures for the next months 

table of contents on march   loral entered into agreements to sell its investment in the canadian broadband business  including the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite  to telesat for million plus reimbursement of approximately million  representing loral s net costs incurred through the closing date 
in addition  if telesat obtains certain supplemental capacity on the payload  loral will be entitled to receive for four years one half of any net revenue actually earned by telesat on such supplemental capacity 
this transaction is expected to close in march see note to the financial statements 
during  the parent company funded approximately million of costs associated with the viasat satellite and related ground infrastructure 
the parent company received cad million of prepayments in from the viasat lessee 
in addition to our cash on hand  we believe that  given the substantial value of our assets  which include our economic interest in telesat and our equity interest in xtar  we have the ability  if appropriate  to access the financial markets for debt or equity at the parent company 
given the continuously changing financial environment  however  there can be no assurance that the parent company would be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms 
during  ss l increased its unrestricted cash position approximately million to million despite its investment in orbital receivables  a reduction in its customer advances and its capital expenditures 
ss l generated million in adjusted ebitda for ss l s cash uses for  in addition to the dividend mentioned above  are projected to include capital expenditures and continued growth in its orbital receivables balance 
with regard to capital expenditures  ss l is initiating a two year infrastructure campaign that will include the building of a second thermal vacuum chamber  completing certain building and systems modifications and purchasing additional test and satellite handling equipment to meet its contractual obligations more efficiently 
capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately million over the two year period before returning to a more customary level of annual expenditures of million to million 
the orbital receivable asset will continue to grow in  though at a lower rate than in  as there was a decrease in satellite construction awards in requiring orbital receivables 
the uncertainty as to the timing and nature of new construction contract awards  milestone receipts and cash flow related to contract assets can change our cash requirements 
ss l believes that  absent unforeseen circumstances  with its cash on hand and cash flow from operations  it has sufficient liquidity to fulfill its obligations for the next months 
the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility also enhances ss l s liquidity position 
risks to cash flow economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect the ability of customers to make payments to us  including orbital receivable payments under satellite construction contracts with ss l 
though most of our customers are substantial corporations for which creditworthiness is generally high  there are certain customers which are either highly leveraged or are in the developmental stage and are not fully funded 
there can be no assurance that these customers will not delay contract payments to  or seek financial relief from  us if such customers have financial difficulties 
if customers fall behind or default on their payment obligations  our liquidity will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that ss l s customers will not default on their obligations to ss l in the future and that such defaults will not materially and adversely affect ss l and loral 
in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer during the pre launch construction phase of the satellite  ss l s construction contracts generally provide ss l with significant rights even if its customers or their successors have paid significant amounts under the contract 
these rights typically include the right to stop work on the satellite and the right to terminate the contract for default 
in the latter case  ss l would generally have the right to retain  and sell to other customers  the satellite or satellite components that are under construction 
the exercise of such rights  however  could be impeded by the assertion by customers of defenses and counterclaims  including claims of breach of performance obligations on the part of ss l  and our recovery could be reduced by the lack of a ready resale market for the affected satellites or their components 
in either case  our liquidity could be adversely affected pending resolution of such customer disputes 

table of contents in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer after satellite delivery and launch when title has passed to the customer  ss l s remedies are more limited 
typically  amounts due post launch and delivery are final milestone payments and  in certain cases  orbital incentive payments 
to recover such amounts  ss l generally would have to commence litigation to enforce its rights 
we believe  however  that  as customers generally rely on ss l to provide orbital anomaly and troubleshooting support for the life of the satellite  which support is generally perceived to be critical to maximize the life and performance of the satellite  it is likely that customers or their successors will cure any payment defaults and fulfill their payment obligations or make other satisfactory arrangements to obtain ss l s support  and our liquidity would not be adversely affected 
ss l s contracts contain detailed and complex technical specifications to which the satellite must be built 
ss l s contracts also impose a variety of other contractual obligations on ss l  including the requirement to deliver the satellite by an agreed upon date  subject to negotiated allowances 
if ss l is unable to meet its contract obligations  including significant deviations from technical specifications or delivering the satellite beyond the agreed upon date in a contract  the customer would have the right to terminate the contract for contractor default 
if a contract is terminated for contractor default  ss l would be required to refund the payments made to ss l to the date of termination  which could be significant 
in such circumstances  ss l would  however  keep the satellite under construction and be able to recoup some of its losses through the resale of the satellite or its components to another customer 
it has been ss l s experience that  because the satellite is generally critical to the execution of a customer s operations and business plan  customers will usually accept a satellite with minor deviations from specifications or renegotiate a revised delivery date with ss l as opposed to terminating the contract for contractor default and losing the satellite 
nonetheless  the obligation to return all funds paid to ss l in the later stages of a contract  due to termination for contractor default  would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
many of ss l s customer contracts include performance incentives  structured as warranty payback or orbital receivables 
if a satellite sold under a contract with performance incentives experiences an anomaly that leads to a degradation in performance as defined in each particular contract  then in the case of warranty payback  ss l would be obligated to return to the customer a portion of the performance incentive payments received and  in the case of orbital receivables  ss l would no longer be entitled to a portion of the future orbital receivable payments owed 
the amount ss l would either need to return to the customer in case of warranty payback  or would no longer be entitled to receive from the customer in the case of orbital receivables  would depend on various factors including the specific contractual specifications  the satellite performance and life remaining  among other items 
our liquidity could be adversely affected by failure to achieve contractual performance incentives 
on october   terrestar networks inc terrestar  an ss l customer  filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as of december   ss l had million of past due receivables from terrestar related to an in orbit ss l built satellite and other related ground system deliverables and million of past due receivables from terrestar related to a second satellite under construction 
ss l had previously exercised its contractual right to stop work on the satellite under construction as a result of terrestar s payment default 
the in orbit satellite long term orbital receivable balance  net of fair value adjustment  reflected on the balance sheet at december  is million 
the long term orbital receivable balance reflected on the balance sheet for the satellite under construction is million 
in addition  there are approximately million of costs that have been committed to and will be incurred in the future  substantially relating to the ground system deliverables 
in february  terrestar withdrew its proposed plan of reorganization and has indicated that it will explore an alternative plan of reorganization or a sale of its assets 
prior to withdrawing its plan  terrestar had indicated that it intended to assume its contract for the satellite under construction 
in march  terrestar filed a motion to authorize it to reject its contacts for the in orbit satellite and related ground system deliverables 
ss l intends to file an objection to terrestar s motion and believes  based on discussions with terrestar  that terrestar intends to negotiate with ss l terms for the assumption of these contracts 
ss l believes and will assert in its objection that the satellite in orbit and related ground system deliverables are critical to the execution of terrestar s operation and business plan 
in addition  under its contracts with terrestar  ss l is obligated to provide orbital anomaly and troubleshooting support for the life of the in orbit 
table of contents satellite and related ground system deliverables  and  if terrestar were to reject these contracts  ss l would not provide this support 
ss l believes that a prudent satellite operator would not risk losing ss l s support services because no other service provider has the data or capability to provide these services which are necessary for the continued successful operation of a satellite over its lifetime 
ss l believes  therefore  although no assurance can be given  that  notwithstanding terrestar s motion to reject the contracts for the in orbit satellite and related ground system deliverables  because of their importance to terrestar and the importance of ss l s ongoing technical support  any plan of reorganization for or sale of assets by terrestar that does not provide for assumption of these contracts would not be feasible 
accordingly  ss l believes that terrestar or its successor in reorganization will likely assume its contracts for the in orbit satellite and related ground system deliverables  and it is not probable that ss l will incur a material loss with respect to the past due receivables or amounts scheduled to be paid in the future under those contracts 
notwithstanding these considerations  if terrestar  nevertheless  were to reject its contracts for the in orbit satellite and related ground system deliverables  and assuming that ss l received no recovery on its claim as a creditor with respect to these contracts  ss l believes that it would incur a loss of approximately million  ss l s cash flow in the short term would be reduced by million and ss l s cash flow over the approximate year life of the satellite would be reduced by an additional million of long term orbital receivables plus interest 
ss l booked seven satellite awards in both and ss l booked six satellite awards in  resulting in backlog of billion at december  ss l has high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on ss l s current cost structure which has been sized to accommodate six to eight satellite contract awards per year  ss l estimates that it covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below four to five awards per year  ss l would be required to phase in a reduction of costs to accommodate this lower level of activity 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites  if it were to occur  is difficult to predict 
it is  therefore  difficult to anticipate the need to reduce costs to match any such slowdown in business  especially when ss l has significant backlog business to perform 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures could adversely affect our liquidity 
we believe that ss l s current backlog  existing liquidity and availability under the credit agreement are sufficient to finance ss l  even if ss l receives fewer than four awards over the next months 
if ss l were to experience a shortage of orders below the four awards per year for multiple years  ss l could require additional financing  the amount and timing of which would depend on the magnitude of the order shortfall coupled with the timing of a reduction in costs 
there can be no assurance that ss l could obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
telesat cash and available credit as of december   telesat had cad million of cash and short term investments as well as approximately cad million of borrowing availability under its revolving facility 
telesat believes that cash and short term investments as of december   cash flow from operations  including amounts provided by operating activities  cash flow from customer prepayments and drawings on the available lines of credit under the credit facility as defined below will be adequate to meet its expected cash requirement for the next months for activities in the normal course of business  including interest and required principal payments on debt as well as planned capital expenditures 
liquidity a large portion of telesat s annual cash receipts are reasonably predictable because they are primarily derived from an existing backlog of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency loral in the normal course of business  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit this foreign exchange rate exposure  the company seeks to denominate its contracts in us dollars 
if we are unable to enter into a contract in us dollars  we review our foreign exchange exposure and  where appropriate  derivatives are used to minimize the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to operating results and cash flows 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes

during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
during that same time period  however  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million
