the increase in our operating loss was caused mainly by the aforementioned revenue decline and the restructuring and other charges incurred during the fiscal year as more fully described below under restructuring and other charges 
we had  in cash at june   essentially flat compared with  at june  our outstanding debt at june  was  down from  at june  as a result of quarterly principal payments made during fiscal however  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our credit agreement at june  largely due to the magnitude of restructuring and other charges incurred during fiscal  as described below under subsequent events amendment agreement and waiver and in note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
subsequent events closure of asian operations on july   our board approved the closure of our operations in hong kong  singapore and shanghai 
this decision was based on the board s determination that these operations did not adequately support our strategic objectives 
we have not yet been able to make a meaningful determination of the range of estimated costs associated with  amounts to be incurred in connection with  and amounts of the charge that will result in future cash expenditures through the closure of these operations 
the disposition plan could result in contract termination costs  severance related charges and other charges 
any such charges will be reflected in our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending september  amendment agreement and waiver on september   we entered into an amendment and waiver to our amended and restated credit agreement 
at june   we were not in compliance with the leverage and interest coverage ratio covenants contained in our amended and restated credit agreement largely due to the magnitude of restructuring and other charges incurred during the fiscal year ended june  pursuant to the amendment and waiver  these covenant violations were permanently waived and we regained compliance with the terms of our

the reductions in staff were communicated to the affected employees in march all actions were completed by march in the us and may in the uk the related cash payments were completed by june in the uk and march in the us at march   we reviewed the estimate of anticipated sublease rental income for our rochester  new york office located at corporate woods 
this review  prompted by adverse changes in real estate market conditions  resulted in a decrease to our estimate of the portion of the remaining lease obligation period over which we expect to derive sublease rental income 
this change in estimate resulted in a charge of in the third quarter of fiscal previously  during the second quarter of fiscal  we took actions to re align the cost structure of our us operations

all actions associated with this vacated space were completed by december the related cash payments were completed in june at december   we reviewed the estimates of anticipated sublease rental income for our grandville  michigan and norwalk  connecticut offices  which were included in restructuring charges taken during the third quarter of fiscal in conjunction with our reduction of leased space at these facilities 
this review  prompted by adverse changes in real estate market conditions within each of these locales  resulted in a decrease to our estimate of the portion of the remaining lease obligation period over which we expect to derive sublease rental income 
this change in estimate resulted in a charge of for the three months ended december  summary of restructuring charges and reserves the following table summarizes the restructuring charges recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june termination benefits lease commitments reversals of prior accruals

consultant fees during fiscal  we incurred fees for services rendered by a consulting firm related to  among others  performance improvement initiatives  bank negotiations  and an interim cfo arrangement  the details of which are described in note  related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
other for fiscal  other included costs associated with reorganizing the operational structure of our canadian and uk operations  as well as immaterial prior period adjustments related to our asia operations 
for fiscal  other included costs associated with reorganizing the operational structure of our asian operations and costs incurred to close our telephone based data collection center in brentford  united kingdom 
for fiscal  other included bad debt expense for a note receivable for which collectability became doubtful  recruitment fees for senior executives  and legal fees associated with the waiver and amendments to our credit agreement due to certain financial covenant violations 
post employment payments to former senior executives consultant fees other critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  impairment of other intangible assets  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  hipoints loyalty program  and contingencies and other accruals 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis 
in assessing contract performance  both input and output criteria are reviewed 
costs incurred are used as an objective input measure of performance 
the primary input of all work performed under these arrangements is labor 
as a result of the relationship between labor and cost  there is normally a direct relationship between the costs incurred and the proportion of the contract performed to date 
costs incurred as an initial proportion of expected total costs is used as an initial proportional performance measure 
this indicative proportional performance measure is always subsequently validated against more subjective criteria ie relevant output measures such as the percentage of interviews completed  percentage of reports delivered to a client and the achievement of any project milestones stipulated in the contract 
in the event of divergence between the objective and more subjective measures  the more subjective measures take precedence since these are output measures 
clients are obligated to pay based upon services performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as it becomes probable that such losses will occur 
invoices to clients in the ordinary course are generated based upon the achievement of specific events  as defined by each contract  including deliverables  timetables  and incurrence of certain costs 
such events may not be directly related to the performance of services 
revenues earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings are classified as unbilled receivables 
amounts billed in excess of revenues earned are classified as deferred revenue 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the fasb guidance for property  plant  and equipment 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with the fasb guidance for property  plant  and equipment 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
a test for recoverability also is performed when we have committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year 
recoverability of an asset group is evaluated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life 
restoration of a previously recognized long lived asset impairment loss is not allowed 
we estimate the fair value of an asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the asset could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates and cost of capital  among others 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset group  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following assumptions are key to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of demand for our services in the marketplace 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for revenue growth 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans 
growth rate the growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 
economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding revenue from services 
these macroeconomic assumptions include inflation  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases for operating profit and tax liability carryforward 
the fasb guidance for income taxes requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of the available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset 
table of contents considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we apply the fasb guidance for uncertain tax positions  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fasb guidance for stock based compensation 
for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense based on the grant date fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which employs the following assumptions expected volatility based on historical volatilities from daily share price observations for our stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the options granted 
expected life of the option based on the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years  calculated using the simplified method as allowed by asc and corroborated through review of the expected life assumptions of publicly traded market research companies 
risk free rate based on the implied yield available at the time the options were granted on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option when granted 
dividend yield based on our historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to our stockholders 
expected volatility and the expected life of the options granted  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes option pricing model  involve management s best estimates at that time 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are set forth in note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
we grant options to purchase our stock at fair value as of the date of grant 
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or restricted shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior and the vesting period of the respective stock options or restricted shares 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
hipoints loyalty program our hipoints loyalty program is designed to reward respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable 
table of contents and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration 
points awarded under the hipoints program expire after nine months of account inactivity 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from the expected redemption rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
contingencies and other accruals from time to time  we record accruals for severance costs both in connection with formal restructuring programs and in the normal course  lease costs associated with excess facilities  contract terminations  and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such actions were approved 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year 
amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not finally determinable until the completion of our fiscal year end closing process 
explanation of key financial statement captions revenue from services we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis  as more particularly described above in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
our revenue from services is derived principally from the following custom research including  but not limited to  customer satisfaction surveys  market share studies  new product introduction studies  brand recognition studies  reputation studies  and ad concept testing 
tracking studies studies that regularly ask identical questions to similar demographic groups within a constant interval once a month  once a quarter  etc 
to provide business decision makers with dynamic data and intelligence 
service bureau research data collection and other services that we perform primarily for market research industry clients 
cost of services our direct costs associated with generating revenues principally consist of the following items project personnel project personnel have four distinct roles project management  survey design  data collection  and data analysis 
we maintain project personnel in north america  europe and asia 
we expect to have no project personnel in asia by september  labor costs are specifically allocated to the projects they relate to 
we utilize a timekeeping system that tracks the time of project personnel as incurred for each specific revenue generating project to determine the labor costs allocable to such project 
respondent incentives our panelists receive both cash and non cash incentives through programs such as our hipoints loyalty program for participating in our surveys 
we award cash incentives to our respondents for participating in surveys  which are earned when we receive timely and complete survey responses 
non cash incentives in the form of points are awarded to respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys  and refer others to join 
table of contents our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to their expiration 
data processing we manage the processing of survey data using our own employees 
we also engage third party suppliers to perform data processing on an as needed basis 
other direct costs other direct costs include direct purchases  principally labor and materials  related to data collection and analysis  and the amortization of software developed for internal use 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense includes the following payroll and related costs  including commissions  for sales and marketing professionals  payroll and related costs for staff in the areas of finance  human resources  information technology  legal  and executive management  and other indirect costs necessary to support the business  including among others  office rents  travel  stock based compensation  and public company costs 
operating income loss we calculate operating income loss as revenue from services less total operating expenses 
operating income loss represents only those amounts that relate to our consolidated operations and does not include interest income and expense  amortization of debt issuance costs  or loss on extinguishment of debt 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes current and deferred income taxes 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and adjust it based on whether or not our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized

by country  north american revenue for fiscal was comprised of revenue from us operations of  down compared with  for fiscal this decline was driven mainly by declines of in our healthcare sector  driven by the revenue impact of bookings decreases experienced during the first nine months of fiscal in our financial services sector  driven mainly by the loss of a large tracking study  in our consumer goods  restaurant and retail sector  as a result of a non recurring project that was sold and delivered during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in our technology  media and telecom sector  driven mainly by the loss of a large tracking study 
revenue from canadian operations of  up compared with  for fiscal in local currency canadian dollar  canadian revenue increased by compared with fiscal the increase was mainly attributable to revenue from work on a large tracking study that was won during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents european revenue decreased by  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal  a decrease of 
by country  european revenue for fiscal was comprised of revenue from uk operations of  down compared with  for fiscal in local currency british pound  uk revenue decreased by compared with fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the revenue impact of a large tracking study that was not renewed during the second quarter of fiscal  as well as challenging market conditions across several industry sectors 
the loss of this tracking study will have a million negative impact on annual uk revenue 
revenue from french operations of  up compared with  for fiscal in local currency euro  french revenue increased by compared with fiscal the increase was due primarily to continued success in selling to new and existing clients across several industry sectors 
revenue from german operations of  up compared with  for fiscal in local currency euro  german revenue increased by compared with fiscal similar to our french operations  the increase was driven mainly by continued success in selling to new and existing clients across several industry sectors 
revenue from asia operations decreased by to  for fiscal  a decrease of compared with fiscal the impact of foreign exchange rate differences on asian revenue was inconsequential compared with fiscal the decrease in asian revenue was driven primarily by a lack of adequate sales resources throughout fiscal cost of services 
cost of services was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal cost of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was impacted by the differing types of custom research projects performed when compared with fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal was  or of total revenue  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal selling  general and administrative expense was principally impacted by the following a decrease in facilities related expense  driven primarily by space reductions taken during fiscal  a decrease in travel expense  driven primarily by our continued focus on controlling these costs  a decrease in payroll related expenses  driven primarily by headcount reductions made throughout fiscal  and a decrease in legal expenses  driven primarily by improved operational efficiency of our legal function 
the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense was the result of decreases across a number of other operating expense categories because of our continued efforts to properly align our cost structure with the needs of our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal when compared with the same prior year period was the result of fixed and intangible assets that became fully depreciated or amortized during fiscal combined with decreased capital spending as part of our overall focus on controlling costs

table of contents interest and other income 
interest and other income was or less than of total revenue for fiscal  compared with or less than of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in interest and other income was principally the result of a lower average cash balance during fiscal when compared with fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of  of which represented unamortized debt issuance costs  as a result of amending and restating our credit agreement on june  we did not incur a similar loss during fiscal further financial information about our amended and restated credit agreement is included in note  borrowings  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
interest expense 
interest expense was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in interest expense for fiscal as compared with fiscal reflects the impact of the decline in our outstanding debt as we continue to make required principal payments  as well as the decline in our effective interest rate as a result of amending our credit agreement in june income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of for fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of  for fiscal the tax provision for fiscal was comprised primarily of tax expense related to income in certain of our foreign jurisdictions 
the tax benefit for fiscal was principally due to a us tax law change which resulted in the recognition of an additional tax benefit of  in addition  a valuation allowance of approximately was recorded during the three months ended june  against the net deferred tax assets of the uk operations due to the impact of the global recession on revenues 
a full valuation allowance continues to be recorded at june  against our deferred tax assets in the us  us  and asia 
we will continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes and will adjust the valuation allowances should all or a portion of the deferred tax assets become realizable in the future

table of contents revenue from german operations of  down compared with  for fiscal in local currency euro  german revenue decreased by compared with fiscal german revenue was essentially flat for the first nine months of fiscal compared with the same prior year period 
the overall decrease was driven by sales growth later in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which had less time to convert to revenue within that same quarter 
revenue from asia operations increased by to  for fiscal  an increase of compared with fiscal the impact of foreign exchange rate differences on asian revenue was inconsequential compared with fiscal the increase in asian revenue was driven primarily by the positive effects of the management changes we made in the region during fiscal cost of services

there was no such charge during fiscal the decrease in interest expense for fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from the decline in our outstanding debt as we continue to make required principal payments 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for fiscal  compared with an income tax provision of  for fiscal the tax benefit for fiscal was principally due to a us tax law change which resulted in the recognition of an additional tax benefit of  in addition  a valuation allowance of approximately was recorded during the three months ended june  against the net deferred tax assets of the uk operations due to the impact of the global recession on revenues 
the tax provision for fiscal was principally impacted by the valuation allowance of  recorded against our us deferred tax assets 
a full valuation allowance was recorded at june  against both us and us deferred tax assets 
significant factors affecting company performance key operating metrics we closely track certain key operating metrics  specifically bookings and secured revenue 
these key operating metrics enable us to measure the current and forecasted performance of our business relative to historical trends 
key operating metrics  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and  were as follows us dollar amounts in millions q q q q q q q q fy fy fy fy fy fy fy fy bookings secured revenue additional information regarding each of the key operating metrics noted above is as follows bookings are defined as the contract value of revenue generating projects that are anticipated to take place during the next four fiscal quarters for which a firm client commitment was received during the current period  less any adjustments to prior period bookings due to contract value adjustments or project cancellations during the current period 
bookings for the three months ended june  were million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
excluding foreign exchange rate differences  bookings were down over the same prior year period 
bookings in local currency for the three months ended june  compared with the same prior year period were principally impacted by the following us bookings increased by  impacted mainly by increased sales in our technology  media and telecom and healthcare sectors  which were offset by decreases in our financial services and consumer goods  restaurant and retail sectors 
canadian bookings decreased by  due primarily to declined sales in our canadian service bureau business 
u 
k bookings decreased by  due primarily to the loss of two large tracking studies in fiscal french and german bookings increased by and  respectively  both due primarily to increased sales at both new and existing clients 

table of contents asian bookings decreased by  due primarily to a shortage of adequate sales resources 
monitoring bookings enhances our ability to forecast long term revenue and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
however  we also are mindful that bookings often vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
information concerning our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts and renewals  as well as extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
secured revenue is defined as prior period secured revenue plus current period bookings  less revenue recognized on outstanding projects as of the end of the period 
secured revenue helps us manage our future staffing levels more accurately and is also an indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
based on our experience  projects included in secured revenue at the end of a fiscal period generally convert to revenue from services during the following twelve months 
secured revenue for the three months ended june  was million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
excluding foreign currency exchange rate differences  secured revenue was down over the same prior year period 
the decrease was due primarily to the impact of bookings declines throughout fiscal when compared with fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents the following table sets forth net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities  for the fiscal years ended june net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of an increase in fiscal net loss compared with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  compared with  used in operating activities for fiscal the change was principally the result of a decrease in the net loss for fiscal when compared with fiscal  along with timing differences in cash payments and receipts when compared with fiscal net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal investing activities for fiscal included capital expenditures  which were offset by in proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities 
investing activities for fiscal consisted solely of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal the change from fiscal was principally the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities to for fiscal  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures from  for fiscal to  for fiscal as a result of leasehold improvements made to our uk office space 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal cash used during both fiscal and was for required 
table of contents principal payments on our outstanding debt  partially offset by cash received from the purchase of shares by employees through our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
the required quarterly principal payments on our outstanding debt decreased from  to  in fiscal as a result of amending our credit agreement in june net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal this change was principally the result of a decrease in the costs associated with modifications to our credit agreement from  in fiscal to in fiscal working capital at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at june  available sources of cash to support known or reasonably likely cash requirements over the next months include cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  additional cash that may be generated from our operations  and funds to the extent available through our credit facilities discussed below 
while we believe that our available sources of cash  including funds available through our revolving line that are subject to certain minimum cash balance requirements  will support known or reasonably likely cash requirements over the next months  including quarterly principal payments of  and interest payments due under our credit agreement  our ability to generate cash from our operations is dependent upon our ability to profitably generate revenue  which requires that we continually develop new business  both for growth and to replace completed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of our revenue  we have had to find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as client relationships and work for continuing clients change and will likely have to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to profitably generate revenue depends not only on execution of our business plans  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
as many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary  our ability to profitably generate revenue is adversely impacted whenever there are adverse macroeconomic conditions in the markets we serve 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our products and services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of new products and services  our technology infrastructure and online panel  and the marketing and selling of our products and services 
we are able to control or defer certain capital and other expenditures in order to help preserve cash if necessary 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of between  and  during the fiscal year ending june  credit facilities the required principal repayments under our amended and restated credit agreement for each of the three succeeding fiscal years are set forth in note  borrowings  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
at june   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit and of outstanding letters of credit 
the letters of credit reduce the remaining undrawn portion of the revolving line that is available for future borrowings 
at june   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement largely due to the magnitude of restructuring and other charges incurred during fiscal on september   these covenant violations were permanently waived through an amendment agreement and waiver  as more fully described above under subsequent events amendment agreement and waiver and in note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have two kinds of market risk exposures  interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
in light of recent economic conditions  we reviewed the cash equivalents and marketable securities held by us 
we do not believe that our holdings have a material liquidity risk under current market conditions 
interest rate exposure at june   we had outstanding debt under our credit facilities of  the debt matures september  and bears interest at the floating adjusted libor plus an applicable margin 
our interest rate swap fixes the floating adjusted libor portion of the interest rate at through 
table of contents september  the additional applicable margin is determined quarterly using a pricing grid based on our consolidated total leverage ratio 
at june   the additional applicable margin was  resulting in an effective interest rate of on our outstanding debt 
using a sensitivity analysis based on a hypothetical increase in prevailing interest rates over a month period  each increase from prevailing interest rates at june  would have decreased the fair value of the interest rate swap by and each decrease from prevailing interest rates at june  would have increased the fair value of the interest rate swap by foreign currency exposure as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have international sales and operations in north america  europe and asia 
we expect to cease operations in asia by september  therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us transactions are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
consolidated income and expense items are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currencies of their home countries  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in our results of operations since we consolidate the results of our international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries was not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating the results of our foreign subsidiaries with our us results due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our consolidated operations 
however  if the operating profits of our international operations increase as a percentage of our consolidated operations  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
thus  we evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk on an ongoing basis 
since our foreign operations are conducted using foreign currencies  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in foreign currencies  given the amount and short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june  holding all other variables constant  we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
