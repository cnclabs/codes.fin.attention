item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities 
cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits 
these cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program which we began in the fourth quarter of refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under gaap  nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion included in this section  as well as other sections of this annual report on form k  contains forward looking statements as that term is used in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance 
forward looking statements by their nature address matters that are  to different degrees  uncertain  and often contain words such as may  could  expect  intend  plan  seek  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect 
for us  these risks and uncertainties include  among others  general industry conditions and competition  including current global financial uncertainty  the impact of market volatility on revenue from asset based fees  damage to our reputation resulting from claims made about possible conflicts of interest  liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties  financial services industry consolidation  a prolonged outage of our database and network facilities  challenges faced by our non us operations  and the availability of free or low cost investment information 
a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks and uncertainties materialize  our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected 
we do not undertake to update our forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events

understanding our company our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals 
we offer an extensive line of data  software  and research products for individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
we also offer asset management services for advisors  institutions  and retirement plan participants 
many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
as a result  we typically generate recurring revenue 
morningstar has two operating segments investment information and investment management 
the investment information segment includes all of our data  software  and research products and services 
these products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
the investment management segment includes our asset management operations  which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset based fees 
we emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability 
historically  we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and marketing our existing products 
however  we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions that support our five key growth strategies  which are enhance our position in key market segments by focusing on our three major internet based platforms  create a premier global investment database  continue building thought leadership in independent investment research  become a global leader in fund of funds investment management  and expand our international brand presence  products  and services 
key business characteristics revenue we generate revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
we sell many of our offerings  such as newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  retirement advice  and licensed data 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement 
we also earn fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management 
overall  revenue tied to asset based fees accounted for about of our consolidated revenue in deferred revenue we frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
the businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models  and as a result  we acquired their deferred revenue 
deferred revenue is the largest liability on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled million as of december  and million as of december  we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription  license  and service agreements 
significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographical markets 
in general  our businesses have high fixed costs  and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on internet based platforms and assets under management 
at times  we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short term operating results 
during other periods  our profitability will improve because we re able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
when revenue decreases  however  the significant operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability 
operating expense we classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios 
development 
this category includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs  including corporate systems  finance and accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight line method based on the useful life of the asset  which ranges from three to seven years 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life  which is generally three years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
we amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic useful lives  which range from one to years 
international operations we have majority owned operations in countries outside of the united states and include these in our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan and sweden using the equity method 
how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price  or to take actions that help us meet short term forecasts but may not be in the long term interest of building shareholder value 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue including organic revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
organic revenue is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations 
we present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period to period results  and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is also considered a non gaap financial measure 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue  we calculate a retention rate 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  the year in review industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis 
we use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
following a strong market rebound in  the us market gained in  as measured by morningstar s us market index  a broad market index 
most global markets also had positive returns for the year 
morningstar s global ex us index rose 
total us mutual fund assets rose to trillion as of december   compared with trillion as of december   based on data from the investment company institute ici 
although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were strong for the year  investors continued to heavily favor fixed income funds rather than equity funds 
us stock funds had negative net cash flows for the year  although less so than in global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend  with total assets increasing but asset flows favoring fixed income funds 
the number of mutual funds in the united states continued to contract slightly to about  in excluding multiple share classes from  in  based on data from the ici 
the number of global mutual funds increased to about  as of september   compared with  as of september   based on ici data 
we estimate that hedge funds included in morningstar s database had about billion in net inflows through november   compared with billion in net outflows for the same period in etfs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds 
the us etf industry closed out with nearly trillion in assets under management based on morningstar s data  up from about billion at the end of based on data from nielsen net ratings  aggregate page views and the time spent per visit for financial and investment sites in both declined by about compared with  while the number of unique visitors was down about 
we believe these trends reflect individual investors lower level of interest in financial and investment related content in the wake of the market downturn 
metrics such as pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit also declined for morningstar 
com in despite these trends  we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies rose sharply in after reductions in and magna  a division of interpublic group  estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about across all industries in  following a decline in in the wake of the global financial crisis  regulators continued to implement new rules for financial services companies 
one of the significant developments in asia last year was the introduction of new regulations and requirements to enforce additional risk disclosures on investment products 
regulators introduced new documents such as the key facts statements in hong kong and product highlights sheets in singapore in to enhance product transparency and to set an overall disclosure standard for investment product documents 
we ve continue to enhance our database and products to help our clients meet these new regulations 
in australia  there are numerous regulatory reviews underway related to industry wide standards for the superannuation industry  as well as fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors 
while we expect these reviews to put pressure on pricing for product providers and result in further consolidation  we believe the superannuation guarantee rates will support continued asset growth 
we believe these trends  along with an emphasis on independent research  continue to make australia an attractive market for morningstar and other third party research providers 
in the european union  undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities ucits is a set of eu directives designed to enable funds to operate across the eu based upon authorization from one state regulator 
ucits iv  approved by the european parliament in january and coming into effect in july  is largely designed to reduce inefficiencies that exist within the current ucits iii framework 
the directive includes several key sections  including requirements for a new key investor information document kiid  an easy to read annual factsheet that replaces the simplified prospectus 
every ucits fund that is promoted to retail investors will have to produce a kid and issue an updated copy within the first business days of each calendar year 
we ve developed prototype documents for the kid and expect to begin providing this service in we re also monitoring the eu transparency directive 
one of the key features of this piece of legislation concerns the disclosure of significant holdings of and by companies 
this directive has contributed to our expansion of the global ownership database  with additional coverage in germany  france  and the united kingdom 
we are reviewing the newly published eu commission report on the directive and potential revisions to the major shareholder obligations 
the united kingdom s retail distribution review rdr  which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees  higher professional standards for financial advisors  and an emphasis on whole of market investment solutions  is scheduled to come into effect at the end of because advisors will be obligated to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles including funds  etfs  and other products and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias  we believe it may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types  which we offer through products such as morningstar direct and morningstar advisor workstation 
in the united states  president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act into law in july the act creates a number of new regulatory  supervisory  and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of us financial markets and activities 
the act also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action  giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas 
as a result  the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge 
aside from corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to all public companies generally  we believe the portion of the act that is the most relevant to morningstar is subtitle c of title ix  which contains changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies 
this section subjects nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  including realpoint  the subsidiary we acquired in may  to greater oversight by the sec 
among other things  it requires the sec to remove the current exemption in regulation fd for credit rating agencies  allows investors to bring private rights of action against credit rating agencies for failing to conduct a reasonable investigation of the facts or to obtain analysis from an independent source  and repeals rule g under the securities act of  which exempted credit rating agencies from being considered experts subject to liability for ratings included in registration statements 
however  the sec issued a no action letter regarding the repeal of rule g and extended the letter indefinitely 
aside from subtitle c and the general corporate governance and disclosure requirements  we believe the majority of the dodd frank act and related regulations will not have a direct effect on morningstar 
however  we continue to monitor the potential impact of these regulations on our clients 
for example  the sec recently recommended that regulators adopt rules requiring that broker dealers be subject to a fiduciary standard  which would impose additional requirements on commission based advisors 
overall  we believe the uncertainty in the financial services sector continued easing throughout with the exception of continued weakness in consumer discretionary spending  business trends steadily improved during the year 
as discussed in more detail in the consolidated operating income section below  during we continued phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation related expenses we previously reduced 
performance summary the list below summarizes the key accomplishments and challenges that our management team has highlighted related to our performance accomplishments we made solid progress building a base for our credit research business and now offer credit ratings and reports on more than corporate credit issuers 
we acquired realpoint  a nationally recognized statistical rating organization that specializes in commercial mortgage backed securities 
we expanded our analyst research and investment consulting work on exchange traded funds  closed end funds  alternative investments  plans  and target date funds all areas that have seen strong investor interest 
we continued to expand our equity research business  doubling our client base in just one year 
we continued building out our global operations  establishing a presence in brazil  chile  mexico  and luxembourg 
we also expanded our international investment research and consulting businesses by acquiring aegis  seeds group  and obsr 
morningstar direct had a record year with more than  new licenses added globally 
both renewal rates for contract based products and services and retention rates for subscription products rose substantially compared with  reflecting improved business conditions and healthier sales trends across most of our product lines 
morningstar s board of directors approved a cent per share initial quarterly dividend and a million share repurchase program  allowing us to return a portion of our cash balance to shareholders 
challenges operating expense rose faster than revenue in  leading to a percentage point decline in our operating margin  in part because we restored some incentive compensation and benefits after reducing them in we have more work to do in fully integrating some of our acquisitions and rebranding many of these businesses under the morningstar umbrella 
while advertising sales on morningstar 
com rebounded strongly us premium membership subscriptions were lower year over year as individual investors have been slow to return to the stock market and remain cautious about discretionary spending 
restatement of previous periods financial information in  we determined that the cumulative effect of adjustments related to prior periods were material  in aggregate  if recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts related primarily to our accounting for deferred taxes and  to a lesser extent  to expense adjustments associated with vacant office space and rent for one of our office leases 
we evaluated the effects of these errors on our prior periods consolidated financial statements  individually and in the aggregate  in accordance with the materiality guidance provided by the sec staff  as included in sab topics m and n  and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated 
however  in accordance with the provisions of these sab topics  we restated our consolidated financial statements  as of and for the years ended december  and please see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the restated financial information 
consolidated results change change revenue operating income operating margin pp pp cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow pp percentage point s as noted in how we evaluate our business  we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
please refer to the discussion on page for more detail 
because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our financial results from year to year is complex 
to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we provide information on both revenue from acquisitions and organic revenue  which reflects our underlying business excluding revenue from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations 
we include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for months after we complete the acquisition 
after that  we include it as part of our organic revenue 
consolidated organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap 
the table below shows the periods in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions 
gbaijpg 
consolidated revenue in  our consolidated revenue increased to million 
we had million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year  mainly reflecting additional revenue from logical information machines  inc lim  realpoint llc realpoint  old broad street research ltd 
obsr  and intech pty limited intech 
acquisitions contributed about percentage points to our consolidated revenue growth 
excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations  consolidated revenue increased by about million  or  in higher revenue from morningstar 
com advertising sales  morningstar direct  and licensed data were the main drivers behind the revenue increase 
these positive factors as well as smaller contributions from advisor software and our investment management products helped offset the loss of revenue associated with the global analyst research settlement gars  which ended in july we had equity research revenue of million related to gars in that did not recur in in  our consolidated revenue decreased to million 
we had about million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year  mainly reflecting additional revenue from tenfore systems limited tenfore  now referred to as real time data as well as k wizard technology  llc k wizard  the equity research and data business from cpms cpms  intech now referred to as ibbotson australia  fundamental data limited fundamental data  and others 
however  this was more than offset by lower organic revenue  largely reflecting a drop in revenue from investment consulting as well as lower equity research revenue related to gars in the second half of investment consulting revenue declined because two clients did not renew their contracts  one in october and the other in may graphic the tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations vs

in contrast  currency translations reduced revenue by nearly million in organic revenue growth improved each quarter in graphic international revenue revenue from international operations increased as a percentage of total revenue in and our non us revenue increased to of consolidated revenue in  compared with in and in several of our recent acquisitions have operations outside the united states

com  and morningstar direct made up about of consolidated revenue in while the percentage of revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent over the past three years  the relative size of products within the top five has changed each year 
licensed data became our largest product in and has remained in that position in and  partly because of incremental revenue from acquisitions 
beginning in  we included revenue from ibbotson s plan sponsor advice service as retirement advice revenue 
previously  we included this revenue in investment consulting 
in and  as a part of the changes to our organizational structure with a focus on our global product lines  we no longer include morningstar site builder as part of morningstar advisor workstation 
site builder consists of a set of integrated tools  content  and reports that investment firms can seamlessly add to their existing advisor websites 
in addition  we re continuing to globalize the premium subscriptions and advertising revenue generated by morningstar 
com websites  which operate in a variety of markets 
as a result  we now include advertising revenue for all non us sites as part of morningstar 
com and have reclassified prior year product revenue for consistency with current year presentation 
these reclassifications did not have any impact on the order of our top five products in or top five products segment revenue of consolidated revenue licensed data investment information investment consulting investment management morningstar advisor workstation investment information morningstar

com investment information principia investment information retention and renewal rates as discussed in how we evaluate our business  we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue 
the following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years graphic for contract based products and services such as licensed data  investment consulting  morningstar direct  and morningstar advisor workstation  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between and and increased about percentage points from the renewal rate was depressed partly because of the end of the global analyst research settlement period 
excluding this factor  the renewal rate rose about percentage points 
this improvement reflects higher renewal rates for many product lines  including licensed data  investment consulting  institutional software  and advisor software 
the figure for contract based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable fee contracts 
in  we estimate that our retention rate for subscription based products  such as principia  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and print and online newsletters  was on the higher end of the range between and  up from to in the change mainly reflects improved retention rates for individual software and principia 
consolidated operating expense operating expense change of revenue change pp pp pp vs 
in  our consolidated operating expense increased million  or 
we completed seven acquisitions in and six in because of the timing of these acquisitions  our results include operating expense that did not exist in the same periods last year 
incremental operating expense from acquired businesses represented more than half of the operating expense increase 
in  we restored some compensation and employee benefits after reducing them in  contributing to the operating expense increase 
higher salary expense represented slightly more than one third of the total operating expense increase  reflecting higher headcount from acquisitions and filling open positions  as well as salary increases made in july we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   a increase from  as of december  we added about employees through acquisitions over the months ending december  the remainder of the increase in headcount mainly reflects continued hiring for our development centers in china and india 
higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately of the overall operating expense increase in in early  we began phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation related expense we reduced in as a result  bonus expense increased million  or  in sales commissions increased million in  reflecting improved sales activity compared with as well as a change to one of our commission plans 
matching contributions to our k plan in the united states increased million in because we partially reinstated this employee benefit in in addition  healthcare benefit costs rose million in operating expense in also included million related to a previously announced separation agreement between morningstar and the former head of morningstar associates 
intangible amortization expense increased million compared with  reflecting additional amortization expense from recent acquisitions 
while operating expense generally increased in  we recorded million of operating expense in related to adjusting the treatment of some incentive stock options and penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises that did not recur in in addition  the recorded expense related to increasing liabilities for vacant office declined by million compared with the amount recorded in operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in  as the increase in operating expense outpaced the increase in revenue 
vs 
our consolidated operating expense decreased million  or  in compared with to better align operating expense with revenue in a challenging business environment  we took a number of steps to reduce costs beginning in  with the largest cutbacks effective january  we changed our bonus plan in to reduce bonus expense  our single largest discretionary cost 
as a result  bonus expense was down about million in the significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with we also suspended matching contributions to our k program in the united states  which reduced operating expense by about million 
in addition  we reduced discretionary spending on travel  advertising  and marketing 
travel costs were about million lower in advertising and marketing costs declined by million in in addition  we discontinued three publications previously published  which contributed to lower marketing expense in the positive impact of these cost reductions was partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions 
we completed six acquisitions in and six in because of the timing of these acquisitions  our results include operating expense that did not exist in headcount and salary expense increased year over year  partly because of incremental employees added through acquisitions 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   a increase from  employees as of december  we added approximately employees through acquisitions over the months ending december  the remainder of the increase in headcount reflects continued hiring for our development center in china 
the cost reductions we implemented in were offset by a total of million of operating expense for two separate matters 
first  we recorded a million operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options that were originally considered incentive stock options isos 
in   and  we granted isos to many employees 
upon exercise  isos typically have a favorable tax treatment for the employee relative to the tax treatment for non qualified stock options nqsos 
in  we determined that certain isos granted to one former and two current executives should have been treated as nqsos for the executives and our income tax purposes 
as a result  morningstar paid these individuals a total of million to compensate for the difference in tax treatment 
we also recorded million  primarily for potential penalties related to this matter 
this million expense is included in our operating expense as a general and administrative expense 
second  we recorded an operating expense of million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
the expense impacted each of our operating expense categories  with approximately half recorded as general and administrative expense 
for some companies  including morningstar  it is common practice for taxes withheld on stock based compensation to be paid with the company s regularly scheduled payroll deposit 
this approach  however  does not technically comply with internal revenue service irs guidelines concerning deposits of taxes withheld in connection with stock based compensation  which generally require that if a company s cumulative deposit liability for all compensation exceeds  the tax withholding must be deposited by the following business day 
transactions related to stock based compensation frequently cause companies to exceed this threshold outside of their regularly scheduled payroll cycles  thus triggering the accelerated deposit rules 
the subject of tax deposit penalties was part of an irs audit that began in and concluded in early we have concluded the matter with the irs and have increased the frequency of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
operating expense in also included additional rent expense of million to increase a liability related to vacant office space  primarily for the former ibbotson headquarters 
we increased the liability because we anticipated receiving lower sublease income and expected it would take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant 
despite significant reductions to bonus expense  operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in  mainly driven by the million of incremental operating expense described above and other expense increases 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold change of revenue change pp pp pp gross profit change gross margin change pp pp pp cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense  accounting for more than one third of our total operating expense over the past three years 
our business relies heavily on human capital  and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services 
cost of goods sold rose million in after declining million in approximately of the increase in was related to recent acquisitions 
higher salaries  bonus expense  and other compensation related expense also contributed to the increase 
the majority of the decline in was driven by lower bonus expense and lower fulfillment expense  partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions 
gross margin declined by about and percentage points in and  respectively 
development expense development expense change of revenue change pp pp development expense increased million in after declining million in the increase in is mainly because of higher salaries  bonus  and compensation related expense for our development teams 
development expense from recent acquisitions also contributed to the increase  but to a lesser extent 
we had approximately employees included in development expense as of december  compared with as of december  in  we capitalized approximately million of operating expense for software development  partially offsetting the increase 
the majority of the decline in was driven by lower bonus expense  partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  development cost was up slightly from the same periods in and sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense change of revenue change pp pp pp sales and marketing expense increased million in  after declining million in higher sales commission expense  which rose million in  was the largest factor behind the increase 
commission expense rose partly because of improved sales activity 
in addition  we recognized more expense in because of a change in our us sales commission structure 
under this new commission plan  we record the entire commission expense in the quarter in which it is incurred 
under the previous commission structure  we recognized the commission expense over the term of the customer contract 
other costs in this category  including salaries and bonuses  and  to a lesser extent  advertising  marketing  and travel  also increased 
approximately one fourth of the increase in sales and marketing expense was related to recent acquisitions 
sales and marketing expense decreased million in lower bonus expense and advertising and marketing were the two largest factors driving this change  with each contributing about of the decline

most of the decline reflects lower bonus expense 
decreases in travel  training  and conferences also contributed to lower expense in this area  but to a lesser extent 
these cost reductions were partially offset by the operating expense related to the two matters mentioned above  which contributed million to general and administrative expense in as a percentage of revenue  g a expense decreased percentage points in and increased percentage points in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense amortization expense total depreciation and amortization expense change of revenue change pp pp pp depreciation expense rose million in and million in the increase in reflects incremental expense from acquisitions and accelerated depreciation expense related to our existing office space in china  in advance of moving into new office space 
the increase in was primarily from higher depreciation expense associated with our new corporate headquarters in chicago 
amortization expense increased million in and million in  reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense increased percentage points in we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by changes to the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with our acquisitions 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense mainly relates to grants of restricted stock units rsus and  beginning in  includes expense related to restricted stock 
restricted stock units restricted stock stock options total stock based compensation expense restricted stock units our stock based compensation expense related to rsus has increased over the past three years  reflecting annual grants 
we began granting rsus in may and have made additional grants each year since then 
we recognize the expense related to rsus over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
we estimate forfeitures for these awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the second quarter  which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest 
we have not recorded any significant changes to stock based compensation related to these adjustments 
restricted stock beginning in  we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of realpoint 
in may  we issued  shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant 
this grant resulted in an expense of approximately million in we amortize this value to stock based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period 
we have assumed that all of the restricted stock will ultimately vest  and therefore haven t incorporated a forfeiture rate in this portion of our stock based compensation expense 
stock options stock based compensation expense related to stock options has declined over the past three years  as stock options granted in previous years were fully vested as of january  stock based compensation expense is included in each of our operating expense categories  as shown below cost of goods sold development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation expense change of revenue change pp pp pp based on grants made through december   we anticipate that total stock based compensation expense will be million in this amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or changes in our estimated forfeiture rate related to these grants 
bonus expense bonus expense change of revenue change pp pp pp bonus expense  which we include in each of our operating expense categories  increased million in after declining million in we reduced our bonus expense in as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue in the challenging business environment 
in  we reinstated a portion of the bonus expense that was previously reduced 
bonus expense for newly acquired operations also contributed to the increase  but to a lesser extent 
overall  bonus expense as a percentage of revenue increased about percentage points in and represents about of revenue 
in  bonus expense declined to of revenue  compared with in the significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with prior to  bonus expense represented approximately to of revenue 
the amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost 
instead  the size of the bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items  including changes in full year operating income relative to the previous year and other factors 
we review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly 
we record bonus expense throughout the year and pay out annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year 
consolidated operating income operating income change operating margin change pp pp pp consolidated operating income fell million in while revenue increased million  our cost base rose more  leading to lower operating income 
the decline in operating income reflects higher incentive compensation  including higher bonus expense and sales commissions  modest compensation increases during the second half of  and reinstating some of the employee benefits and other expenses we reduced in in  costs rose across all of our operating expense categories  with the exception of a million operating expense recorded in that did not recur in with operating expense increasing more than revenue  our operating margin was percentage points lower in the margin decline mainly reflects higher compensation  bonuses  sales commissions  and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue 
the loss of revenue from gars also had a negative effect on margins 
acquisitions represented approximately percentage points of the margin decline for the year 
consolidated operating income decreased million in  as the million decline in revenue was partially offset by a million reduction in operating expense 
we took a number of steps to reduce our cost structure in mainly by reducing employee benefit costs and bonus expense 
we reduced our single largest discretionary cost  bonus expense  by million  with changes to the bonus plan in we also suspended matching contributions to our k program in the united states  which accounted for about million of expense in while we reduced operating expense in several areas with these cost savings initiatives  we also recorded a total of million of unanticipated expense for two separate matters  including million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of incentive stock options granted in previous years and million of operating expense for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
because operating expense declined at a slower pace than revenue  the operating margin was down about percentage points from the million of operating expense described above represented about percentage points of the margin decline 
graphic consolidated free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
we present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business 
free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under gaap 
also  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we generated positive free cash flow in   and as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded our level of capital expenditures  as shown below change change cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow free cash flow increased million in after declining million in cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures followed similar trends  increasing in after declining in cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million in  mainly because cash paid in for bonuses was lower than in we made bonus payments of million in the first quarter of  compared with million in the first quarter of the positive cash flow impact of a lower bonus payment was partially offset by million in payments we made to one former and two current executives related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options isos 
we recorded the operating expense related to this matter in the fourth quarter of cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared with the decline in cash provided by operating activities reflects a lower cash benefit from accrued compensation as well as an increase of million for bonus payments 
we made bonus payments of million in the first quarter of  compared with million in the first quarter of bonuses paid in the first quarter of included million in payments deferred from we revised our bonus program in january and no longer defer payment of a portion of bonuses recorded in the prior year 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities in included a million benefit from deferred rent  primarily for tenant improvement allowances related to the construction of our new corporate headquarters 
this benefit did not recur in excess tax benefits declined million in because of a reduction in the number of options exercised and lower average stock prices on the exercise dates 
to provide investors with additional insight into our financial results  we provide a comparison between the change in consolidated net income and the change in cash provided by operating activities change change consolidated net income adjustments to reconcile consolidated net income to net cash flows from operating activities holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity method investments deferred income tax benefit expense excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units depreciation and amortization expense stock based compensation expense all other non cash items included in net income changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions cash paid for bonuses cash paid for income taxes accounts receivable deferred revenue income taxes current accrued compensation deferred rent other assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities all other cash provided by operating activities in  cash provided by operating activities increased more than consolidated net income

in  cash provided by operating activities declined more than consolidated net income 
deferred rent of million  primarily for tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters in chicago  benefited cash flow in the tenant improvement allowance received in is being amortized as a reduction in office lease expense over the lease term and will be deducted from net income to arrive at cash provided by operating activities 
the million increase in tax payments  the million increase in bonuses paid in  and a lower cash flow benefit from accrued compensation  primarily reflecting the reduction in the bonus expense  also contributed to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity  which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
in   and we classified million  million  and million of excess tax benefits  respectively  as financing activities 
we describe these excess tax benefits in the liquidity and capital resources section 
capital expenditures we spent million for capital expenditures in  primarily for computer hardware and leasehold improvements 
a significant portion of the capital expenditures in are for new office space in shenzhen  china 
this new office facility was substantially completed in early in  capital expenditures were million  a decrease of million from mainly because of the timing of payments related to our new corporate headquarters in chicago

principia is our cd rom based investment research and planning software for advisors 
the investment information segment also includes morningstar equity research  which we distribute through several channels 
from june through july  our equity research was distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the global analyst research settlement gars 
the period covered by gars ended in july although the banks covered by gars are no longer required to provide independent research to their clients  we entered into equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under gars 
we also sell equity research to several other companies that purchase our research for their own use or provide our research to their affiliated financial advisors or to individual investors 
in addition  we re continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors  financial advisors  and institutions through a variety of other channels 
in  we replaced approximately one third of the lost annual gars revenue with other equity research business 
in december  we began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers 
we entered into our first credit research agreement with a major financial services firm to provide credit ratings and research to its  financial advisors beginning in the third quarter of the firm s internal credit research team also has access to morningstar select  our institutional credit research platform 
although the revenue impact in was not significant  we believe this credit research agreement gives us an important foothold in this new area 
we also offer a variety of financial communications and newsletters  other investment software  and investment indexes 
this segment represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in   and  respectively 
graphic revenue revenue from our investment information segment increased million  or  to million in acquisitions contributed million of revenue in primarily from lim  realpoint  obsr  and cpms 
revenue from acquisitions represents approximately percentage points of the revenue increase in excluding acquisitions  higher revenue in our software  data  and investment research products and services more than offset the loss of million of revenue from gars  which expired at the end of july organic revenue for our software product lines was up approximately million  driven by morningstar 
com  morningstar direct  and to a lesser extent from advisor workstation and site builder and licensed tools 
in  revenue for our investment information segment declined million 
acquisitions contributed million to segment revenue in  partially offsetting the million revenue decline experienced across a number of our product lines  including the loss of million of gars revenue in revenue from our investment research products was down million  or 
approximately million of the decrease resulted from the end of gars and an additional million of the decrease reflects lower revenue from investment newsletters 
organic revenue for software product lines was down about million  or  driven by a million decline in the us version of morningstar 
com and a million revenue decline in advisor software 
these declines were partly offset by a million revenue increase for institutional software and data related products and services 
revenue for morningstar 
com  which includes internet advertising sales and premium membership subscriptions  was the primary driver of the segment revenue increase in in  positive trends in internet advertising sales were partially offset by continued decline in premium membership revenue in the united states 
internet advertising increased in  after declining in subscriptions for the us version of the morningstar 
com premium service declined to  as of december  compared with  as of december   and  as of december  the shortfall in revenue was due to a weak trial pipeline but we believe our retention efforts stemmed the rate of decline in subscriptions in in addition  we moderately increased subscription prices for us premium membership in both january and  which partly offset the revenue decline associated with lower subscription levels 
morningstar direct made positive contributions to segment revenue in both and the number of licenses for morningstar direct increased to  worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  and  as of december   with strong growth in the us and internationally 
the growth in licenses reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients  as well as client migrations to morningstar direct from institutional workstation 
advisor software revenue represented approximately of the increase in segment revenue in as higher revenue from advisor workstation and site builder and licensed tools offset the decline in principia revenue 
in comparison  advisor software revenue was down in because lower principia revenue more than offset the increase in advisor workstation and other products 
principia revenue declined in and in the decline partly reflects clients migrating from principia to advisor workstation 
the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation increased slightly to  as of december  from  as of december  and  as of december  principia subscriptions totaled  as of december   down from  as of december  and  as of december  licensed data made positive contributions to segment revenue in both and  reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts 
the licensed data service gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases  including real time pricing data 
the data packages we offer include proprietary statistics  such as the morningstar style box and morningstar rating  and a wide range of other data  including information on investment performance  risk  portfolios  operations data  fees and expenses  cash flows  and ownership 
investment research revenue declined in as well as in as mentioned above  the period covered by gars expired at the end of july our post settlement equity research revenue in replaced approximately one third of the annual gars revenue 
gars revenue was million in  compared with million in we entered into new equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under gars 
in addition  we re continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors  financial advisors  and institutions through a variety of other channels 
revenue from our other investment research products was essentially flat in after declining in in  higher revenue from conferences and corporate credit ratings research helped offset the continuing decline in revenue from newsletters and books 
in the first quarter of  we discontinued three of the print publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year morningstar funds  morningstar stocks  and morningstar etfs lower advertising revenue from publications sold in australia and lower revenue from the annual morningstar investment conference held in the second quarter also contributed to the decline in operating income in  operating income for the investment information segment decreased million  or  as operating expense increased more than revenue 
operating expense was up million in  with additional costs from acquisitions contributing approximately of the increase 
higher salaries reflecting expanded headcount and incentive compensation including bonus and sales commission expense also contributed to the increase 
bonus expense increased million in  including incremental bonus expense from recent acquisitions 
an increase in employee benefits expense  including employee healthcare benefits and the partial reinstatement of matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  also contributed to the increase  but to a lesser extent 
operating margin for the investment information segment declined percentage points in approximately percentage points of the margin decline reflects higher compensation related expense as a percentage of revenue 
acquisitions had a slightly negative impact on the margin 
in  operating income for the investment information segment was million  a slight decrease compared with  as the million decline in revenue was partially offset by lower operating expense 
operating expense decreased million in as cost reductions for bonuses  other compensation expense  and advertising and marketing were partially offset by additional operating expense from acquisitions 
bonus expense declined million in most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue 
the reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with other compensation related expense was down  primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  reducing operating expense by million in sales and marketing costs decreased million in most of the decline reflects lower spending on advertising and marketing primarily direct mail expense and lower travel costs  which we pared back because of the challenging business environment 
as mentioned above  we discontinued three of the publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year  and therefore didn t incur costs to promote these publications in investment management segment the investment management segment includes all of our asset management operations  which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset based fees 
the key products and services in this segment based on revenue are investment consulting  which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds  including mutual funds and variable annuities  retirement advice  including the morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson platforms  and morningstar managed portfolios  a fee based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund  exchange traded fund  and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons  risk levels  and investment strategies that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax deferred accounts 
in the majority of our contracts that include variable asset based fees  we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter 
the method of calculation varies by client  some contracts include provisions for calculating average assets based on daily data  while others use weekly or monthly data 
other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets 
our investment consulting business has multiple fee structures  which vary by client 
in general  we seek to receive asset based fees for any work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios 
for any individual contract  we may receive flat fees  variable asset based fees  or a combination of the two 
some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level  above which we also receive variable asset based fees 
in our retirement advice business  our contracts may include fixed fees for advice and guidance  one time setup fees  technology licensing fees  asset based fees for managed retirement accounts  or a combination of these fee structures 
we do not disclose a fee range for our investment consulting and retirement advice businesses because our fee structures are customized by client 
in addition  we believe disclosing a fee range would be detrimental to our competitive position 
we disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures for example  a change from flat fees to asset based fees in our periodic filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results 
for morningstar managed portfolios  we charge asset based fees  which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s average daily account balance 
fees for our mutual fund and etf portfolios generally range from to basis points 
we charge basis points for our customized stock portfolios 
this segment represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in   and  respectively 
graphic revenue investment management segment revenue increased million  or  in acquisitions contributed million of revenue in  primarily from the intech and obsr acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions  revenue increased across all product categories in retirement advice was the main driver of the revenue increase in we primarily earn license based fees for the advice and guidance services we provide through our retirement advice platform 
revenue for these services increased in primarily from advice by ibbotson  after declining in because of several smaller client non renewals 
investment consulting and managed portfolios also contributed to the revenue increase in  but to a lesser extent 
higher revenue from investment consulting in was partially offset by a client non renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of the revenue increase in represented a positive change from trends in in  investment management revenue was down  driven by two investment consulting non renewals 
in  investment consulting  which was a leading contributor to revenue growth in previous years  accounted for about three fourths of the segment s revenue decline 
one client did not renew its contract when it expired in the fourth quarter of and another client did not renew its contract in may combined  these contracts represented about million of revenue in acquisitions contributed million to segment revenue in  partially mitigating the revenue decline 
we had approximately million in revenue from asset based fees in  an increase of approximately compared with million in in  revenue from asset based fees was million 
revenue from asset based fees made up approximately of consolidated revenue in both and  down slightly from in within the investment management segment  revenue from asset based fees made up approximately of segment revenue over the past three years 
total assets under advisement and management were billion as of december   an increase from billion as of december  and billion as of december  about billion of the total assets as of december  reflects a new fund of funds program that began in may for an existing morningstar associates client 
previously  morningstar created model portfolios for the same client  so the increase in assets represents incremental growth for an existing revenue stream 
excluding assets from the new fund of funds program  total assets under advisement and management increased  mainly reflecting positive market performance 
total assets under advisement also include approximately billion from the intech acquisition in july the asset totals as of the end of each year don t fully reflect the change in average asset levels during the year 
the asset based fees we earn are primarily based on average asset levels during each quarter 
average assets under advisement and management calculated based on available quarterly or monthly data were approximately billion in  up about from billion in in  average asset levels declined from substantially higher levels in average assets under advisement and management were billion in assets under advisement for investment consulting as of december assets under advisement for investment consulting billions ibbotson associates morningstar associates total we provided investment consulting advisory services on approximately billion in assets as of december   compared with approximately billion as of december  and approximately billion as of december  the asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis point fees  including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity 
we also provide investment consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee  we do not include these assets in the total reported above 
excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations  changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
as mentioned above  assets under advisement as of december  includes approximately billion related to a new fund of funds program that began in may for an existing morningstar associates client 
excluding assets from the new fund of funds program  assets under advisement for investment consulting increased slightly over  mainly reflecting positive market performance partially offset by a client non renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of total assets under advisement for investment consulting as of december  declined approximately compared with december   as assets under advisement from morningstar associates declined  which was partially offset by assets under advisement from ibbotson associates  which increased about 
the majority of the asset decline in reflects the loss of one of the contracts discussed above  partially offset by positive market performance  and  to a lesser extent  from net inflows and new client wins in assets under advisement 
we cannot separately quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios because we do not have custody of the assets in the majority of our investment management business 
the information we receive from our clients does not separately identify the impact of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period 
we also cannot precisely quantify the impact of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations 
assets under management for managed retirement accounts as of december assets under management for managed retirement accounts billions advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total assets under management for retirement advice increased to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  and billion as of december  we cannot separately quantify the factors affecting assets under management for our managed retirement accounts 
these factors primarily consist of employer and employee contributions  plan administrative fees  market movements  and participant loans and hardship withdrawals 
we cannot quantify the impact of these other factors because the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances due to market movement 
the tables below show the breakdown of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson  as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access 
as of december plan participants millions advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total plan sponsors approximate advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total plan providers advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total morningstar managed portfolios morningstar managed portfolios also contributed to the segment s revenue increase in  although to a lesser extent than retirement advice 
the higher revenue mainly reflects higher average asset levels during compared with assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios were billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  and billion as of december   reflecting positive equity market returns and net inflows 
operating income in  operating income for the investment management segment increased million  or  as revenue increased more than operating expense 
in contrast  operating income declined million  or  as reductions in operating expense were not sufficient enough to outweigh the revenue decline 
in  operating expense in this segment rose million  or  after declining million  or  in approximately of the segment s operating expense increase reflects recent acquisitions 
higher salaries and incentive compensation  including bonuses and sales commissions  contributed approximately two thirds of the overall operating expense increase in this segment 
bonus expense rose million in sales commissions and employee benefits  including employee healthcare benefits and matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  also increased  but to a lesser extent 
operating expense in also includes million related to a separation agreement between morningstar and the former head of morningstar associates 
a slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service partially offset these increases 
in  the operating expense decrease was primarily because of lower bonus and other compensation related expense  partially offset by additional operating expense related to the intech acquisition 
bonus expense declined million in most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue 
the reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with other compensation related expense was down  primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  reducing operating expense by million in a slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service also contributed to the decrease 
the segment s operating margin in the segment decreased percentage points to in the margin decline mainly reflects higher bonus expense as a percentage of revenue 
the million separation payment reduced the margin by approximately percentage points 
salaries and employee benefits also contributed to the margin decline  but to a lesser extent 
in addition  acquisitions had a negative impact on the margin of approximately percentage points 
operating margin was in  an increase of percentage points over lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue was the main driver of the margin improvement 
the decrease in other compensation related expense also contributed to the margin improvement  although to a much lesser extent 
these factors were offset by incremental costs from the intech acquisition and higher compensation expense as a percentage of revenue 
corporate items we do not allocate corporate costs to our business segments 
the corporate items category also includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded when we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions 
the table below shows the components of corporate items that impacted our consolidated operating income amortization expense depreciation expense corporate unallocated corporate items change amortization of intangible assets increased million in and million in  mainly reflecting incremental amortization expense related to acquisitions completed in and we paid million for acquisitions during the past three years 
as of december  and december   respectively  we had million and million of net intangible assets 
we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives  ranging from one to years 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be approximately million in some of the purchase price allocations are preliminary  and the values assigned to intangible assets and the associated amortization expense may change in future periods 
after increasing million in  depreciation expense for corporate departments did not change significantly in from we relocated to our new corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of  resulting in higher depreciation expense in the subsequent years 
in  corporate unallocated expense decreased million  as some expenses recorded in did not recur in corporate unallocated expense in includes million of expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options and deposit penalties 
in  expense related to liabilities for vacant office space declined million 
in addition  in we capitalized approximately million of operating expense for software development 
these factors  which favorably impact the year over year comparison  were partially offset by incremental expense from acquisitions  higher compensation and bonus expense  and higher professional fees 
corporate unallocated increased million in as certain expenses recorded in more than offset the expense reductions implemented in the increases included the million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options  as well as an operating expense for the deposit penalty of million 
this category also includes a million expense to increase lease vacancy reserves  primarily for the former ibbotson headquarters 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  non operating income  and income tax expense equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income loss of morningstar japan kk mjkk and morningstar sweden ab 
in the first six months of  this category also included our portion of the net income loss of morningstar denmark 
in and  this category also included our portion of the net income loss of morningstar denmark and morningstar korea 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities is primarily from our position in mjkk 
in  we acquired an additional ownership interest in morningstar denmark  increasing our ownership percentage to 
as a result  we no longer account for our investment in morningstar denmark using the equity method 
in july  we began consolidating the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of morningstar denmark in our consolidated financial statements 
in  we acquired an additional ownership interest in morningstar korea  increasing our ownership percentage to 
as a result  we no longer account for our investment in morningstar korea using the equity method 
in september  we began consolidating the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of morningstar korea in our consolidated financial statements 
we describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income the following table presents the components of net non operating income interest income  net other income expense  net non operating income  net interest income  net mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio 
net interest income decreased million in and million during the decrease in both years reflects lower returns on our invested balances during the year 
other income  net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our us and us operations 
it also includes royalty income from mjkk and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
in  we recorded a holding gain of approximately million 
this gain represents the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in morningstar denmark at the date of acquisition 
in  we recorded a holding gain of approximately million when we increased our ownership in morningstar korea 
income tax expense the following table summarizes our effective tax rate income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests total income tax expense effective tax rate for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our effective tax rate was  a decrease of percentage points compared with the lower tax rate in reflects the positive impact of certain income tax benefits  including the difference between us federal and foreign tax rates  tax credits related to morningstar s research and development activities  and the use of foreign net operating losses that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance 
these items favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately percentage points in income tax expense in includes approximately million of non cash expense related to the million holding gain we recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of morningstar denmark 
this income tax expense did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in in  our effective tax rate decreased by percentage points compared with despite several items that increased our effective tax rate 
state income taxes represented percentage points of our effective tax rate compared with percentage points in  due to a favorable impact from reducing accruals for state income taxes in that did not recur in second  in  we recorded an operating expense of million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
this penalty is not deductible for income tax purposes and increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
the million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of stock options originally considered incentive stock options increased the effective tax rate by percentage points  as these operating expenses are subject to deduction limitations for income tax purposes 
the above items  which increased our effective tax rate  were partially offset by three main factors 
first  research and development and foreign tax credits  some from previous years  reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points 
a reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations  also reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points in as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations and have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of these nols 
because of the historical operating losses for certain non us operations  a valuation allowance is required because we do not believe that we will be able to use all of our non us nols 
certain positions we have taken or intend to take on our us and non us tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million  if recognized  would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by million 
it is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the creation or reversal of valuation allowances for our non us operations as well as to changes in unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments  emphasizing principal preservation  and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high quality stand alone credit ratings 
investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years  the weighted average maturity is approximately one year 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including working capital and funding future growth 
to date we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit 
over the past three years  we invested million for acquisitions  less cash acquired  with internally generated funds 
we expect to make a recurring quarterly dividend payment 
we paid our first dividend in january to shareholders of record as of december  this dividend was cents per share for a total cash payment of million 
in september  our board of directors also approved a share repurchase program that authorizes a repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
through december   we paid million to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program 
from time to time we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate 
graphic cash  cash equivalents  and investments as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  an increase of million compared with december  this increase mainly reflects cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from employee stock option exercises  partially offset by payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we used a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of to make annual bonus payments of approximately million 
in  we expect to pay approximately million to two former executives as part of previously announced separation agreements 
cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
we typically pay bonuses in the first quarter of the year 
as a result  cash flow from operations in the first quarter tends to be lower compared with subsequent quarters 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase of million over the increase primarily reflects lower bonus payments in we paid million in annual bonus payments in the first quarter of  compared with million in the bonuses paid in included approximately million of bonus expense recorded in and approximately million of bonus payments deferred from in accordance with bonus program revisions adopted in january  we no longer defer payment of a portion of the bonus from prior years 
in addition  in  we paid million to one former and two current executives to adjust the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by million of net income adjusted for non cash items partially offset by million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities  mainly driven by bonus payments 
we paid million for bonuses in  including million in deferred payments from the cash flow impact of these payments was partially offset by the cash flow benefit from accrued compensation for the bonuses 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities benefited from a million increase in deferred rent related to tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters  a million increase in accrued compensation  and a million increase in income taxes payable 
bonus payments of approximately million and tax payments of million offset these cash flow benefits 
graphic cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments less proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments  and cash used for capital expenditures 
the level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories 
cash used for investing activities was million in  million in  and million in cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
we completed seven acquisitions in the majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of realpoint  obsr  morningstar denmark  and the annuity intelligence business of advanced sales and marketing corp 
in comparison  cash used for acquisitions  net of acquired cash  was million in we completed six acquisitions in and increased our investment in morningstar korea 
the majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of lim and our acquisition of the equity research and data business cpms 
in  cash used for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million  with the majority of this used for our acquisition of the hemscott data  media  and investor relations website businesses and tenfore systems limited 
in  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by million 
in contrast  purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments  were million and million in and  respectively 
in  we transferred funds from our investment portfolio to cash and cash equivalents to pay for acquisitions made in as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of million and million  respectively 
as of december   our investments represented approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents  and investments  down percentage points compared with december  capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the capital expenditures include spending for our new office space in shenzhen  china 
capital expenditures peaked in when we paid for the build out of our new headquarters in chicago 
some of the cash outlay for this investment continued into capital expenditures in also include investment for a couple of our office locations in europe 
tenant improvement allowances of million  which are included in cash provided by operating activities  reduced the total amount of cash we paid for the headquarters build out in we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million in  primarily for leasehold improvements at new and existing office locations 
a portion of this includes remaining payments for our new development center in china 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
these cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
similarly  the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units 
these excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized 
it is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as a result  we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time 
note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december  in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million  while excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled million 
partially offsetting these inflows was million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  driven by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises  a decline in excess tax benefits  and to a lesser extent cash used to repurchase common shares 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled million 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  or  compared with  driven mostly by a million decline in excess tax benefits  and to a lesser extent by a million decline in proceeds from stock option exercises 
the decrease mainly reflects a lower average stock price at the time the stock options were exercised and a decrease in the number of options exercised 
employees exercised approximately million  million  and million stock options in   and  respectively 
the total intrinsic value of options exercised during   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
acquisitions we invested a total of million  less cash acquired  related to acquisitions over the past three years 
we describe these acquisitions  including purchase price and product offerings  in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on events subsequent to december  application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition  including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable 
for contracts that combine multiple products and services  we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately 
delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue 
if arrangements include an acceptance provision  we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance 
we make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a case by case basis 
we typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired several companies that complement our business operations 
over the past three years  the total cash paid for acquisitions  less cash acquired  was million 
as of december   we have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
as of december   we allocated million of gross value to intangible assets  primarily for customer related assets  technology based assets  and intellectual property 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to years 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
for each acquisition  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill in accordance with asc  business combinations 
once it has been determined that recognition of an asset or liability in a business combination is appropriate  the asset or liability generally is measured at fair value in accordance with the principles of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas identify the acquired intangible assets for each acquisition  we identify the intangible assets acquired 
these intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships  trademarks and tradenames  technology related intangibles including internally developed software and databases  and non compete agreements 
estimate the fair value of these intangible assets we consider various approaches to value the intangible assets 
these valuation approaches include the cost approach  which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility  the market approach  which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets  and the income approach  which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce 
estimate the remaining useful life of the assets for each intangible asset  we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset 
for example  for customer relationships  we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates 
for technology related assets such as databases  we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life 
for internally developed software  we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software 
assess the appropriate method for recording amortization expense over the intangible asset s useful life we use judgment to determine the rate at which the amortization expense should be recognized 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method should be used 
based on this guidance  we amortize intangible assets over their expected useful life using a straight line amortization method 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 
goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to an impairment test annually  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
our reporting units are components of our reportable segments and constitute businesses for which discrete financial information  which is regularly reviewed by management  is available 
we performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of   and and did not record any impairment losses in these years  reflecting our assessment that our estimates of fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of property  equipment  and capitalized software  net of accumulated depreciation  and million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
in accordance with fasb asc  subsequent measurement impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
our stock based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock 
under fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
we ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
instead  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year  we adjust the stock based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested 
in addition  we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested 
in and  we recorded approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense related to these changes in estimates 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us operations  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions 
tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  are permanent 
other differences  such as depreciation expense  reverse over time 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax assets include million of deferred tax assets related to million of net operating losses nols of our non us operations 
because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future  we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance 
these adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
we assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
we use judgment to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns 
we adjust these liabilities  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities 
it typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations  which we describe in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu supersedes eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities  addresses how to separate deliverables  and specifies how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration 
vendors often provide multiple products or services to customers 
because products and services are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same contractual arrangement  this guidance enables vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
for morningstar  asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on january  also in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this update affects vendors that sell or lease tangible products in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole 
asu no 
does not affect software revenue arrangements that do not include tangible products and also does not affect software revenue arrangements that include services if the software is essential to the functionality of those services 
we adopted asu no

in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu no 
requires entities to disclose information in the level rollforward about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis

in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for these reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in making this determination  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance 
for morningstar  asu no 
is effective on january  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu no 
specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
asu no 
also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
for morningstar  asu no 
is effective prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after january  contractual obligations the table below shows our known contractual obligations as of december  and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations thereafter total minimum commitments on non cancelable operating lease obligations unrecognized tax benefits remaining payments related to shenzhen office build out total the non cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space 
represents unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest  less the impact of any associated tax benefits recorded in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
the amount included in the table represents amounts for which the statues of limitations are expected to lapse during the table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  included as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
our investment portfolio is mainly invested in high quality fixed income securities 
we do not have any direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balance was million 
based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue  fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
