item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation 
while we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  these are expensive  and in addition it is very difficult to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate  our business and our operations 
most latin american countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation 
inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of latin american countries 
governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation  coupled with speculation about possible future actions  have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most latin american countries 
the latin american countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy  including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation  particularly in venezuela which has recently became highly inflationary  we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures 
a return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
developments in other markets may affect the latin american countries where we operate  our financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of securities of companies such as ourselves  may be  to varying degrees  affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets 
although economic conditions vary from country to country  investors perceptions of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries  including latin american countries 
various latin american economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in recent times  including mexico in  the collapse of several asian economies between and  the economic crisis in russia in  the brazilian devaluations in january of and in  the argentine crisis of and the market decline after september  furthermore  latin american economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy 
developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be expected to adversely affect the economies of latin american countries and therefore us 
e commerce transactions in latin america may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods 
unlike in the united states  consumers and merchants in latin america can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third party fraud 
as secure methods of payment for e commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in latin america  both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e commerce transactions 
in addition  many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud 
unless consumer fraud laws in latin american countries are modified to protect e commerce merchants and consumers  and until secure  integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region  our ability to generate revenues from e commerce may be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our company

the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors  many of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our business 
further  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies

they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
so long as these stockholders continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock  they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our company

we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion organically or through strategic acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
these inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate

if any of these stockholders  the affiliated entities controlled by them or their respective permitted transferees holding a significant amount of our restricted common stock were to sell a large number of their restricted or registered shares  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
in addition  the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions 
the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 
our stockholders may not receive dividends or dividends may not grow over time

in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  and the other rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market 
we are also subject to various other regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act

as a result  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm the trading price of our stock 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering in august  we became subject to the rules of the nasdaq global market 
our compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in us courts 
although we are a delaware corporation  our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
furthermore  most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the united states 
as a result  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in us courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws 
it is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
it is equally unclear if judgments entered by us courts based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states

overview mercadolibre  inc together with its subsidiaries  us  we  our or the company or mercadolibre hosts the largest online commerce platform in latin america focused on enabling e commerce and its related services 
our services are designed to provide our users with mechanisms for buying  selling  paying  collecting  generating leads and comparing via e commerce transactions in an effective and efficient manner 
through our online commerce platform  we provide buyers and sellers with a robust online commerce environment that fosters the development of a large and growing e commerce community in latin america  a region with a population of over million people and one of the fastest growing internet penetration rates in the world

additionally  through online classified listings  our registered users can list and purchase motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate and services 
any internet user can browse through the various products and services that are listed on our web site and register with mercadolibre to list  bid for and purchase items and services 
to complement the mercadolibre marketplace  we developed mercadopago  an integrated online payments solution 
mercadopago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the mercadolibre marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely  easily and promptly send and receive payments online 

table of contents as a further enhancement to the mercadolibre marketplace  in we launched our mercadoclics program to allow businesses to promote their products and services on the internet 
through mercadoclics users and advertisers are able to place display and or text advertisements on our web pages in order to promote their brands and offerings 
mercadoclics offers advertisers a cost efficient and automated platform through which it will acquire traffic 
advertisers purchase  on a cost per clicks basis  advertising space that appear alongside product search results for specific categories and other pages 
these advertising placements are clearly differentiated from product search results and direct traffic both to and off platform to the advertisers destination of choice 
during  we launched the mercadoshops on line stores solution

these webstores are hosted by mercadolibre and offer integration with the other marketplace  payments and advertising services we offer 
users can choose from a basic  free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and added services on their stores 
we were incorporated in delaware in october and introduced web sites in argentina  brazil  mexico  colombia  chile  uruguay and venezuela by april in order to build a critical mass of customers  we initially offered our services free of charge in all of these markets 
in may  we obtained significant financing and reached gross merchandise volume of million 
in  we launched a new version of our site and brand and launched our operations in ecuador 
our gross merchandise volume for the year ending december  grew to million 
our gross merchandise volume reached million for  million for and million for in november of  we acquired certain operations of deremate 
com  inc and our gross merchandise volume reached million 
during  we launched sites in costa rica  the dominican republic and panama  and our gross merchandise volume reached  million 
our gross merchandise volume was  million for in august  we successfully completed our initial public offering through which  shares of our common stock were sold at a initial public offering price of per share less an underwriting discount of 
out of that total   shares of common stock were sold by us and  were sold by selling shareholders 
we  along with certain shareholders  granted to the underwriters an option  exercisable for days from august   to purchase up to  additional shares at the public offering price less the underwriting discount 
the option was exercised in full  and of that total  an additional  shares were sold by us and  were sold by the selling shareholders 
in january  we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of classified media group  inc  or cmg  and its subsidiaries 
cmg and its subsidiaries operate an online classified advertisements platform primarily dedicated to the sale of automobiles at www 
tucarro 
com in venezuela  colombia and puerto rico and real estate at www 
tuinmueble 
com in venezuela  colombia  panama  the united states  costa rica and the canary islands 
on the acquisition date  we paid million subject to certain escrows and working capital adjustment clauses 
on june   the company released to the former cmg shareholders millions in full satisfaction of the management escrow 
on january   we released the escrow balance of million to the sellers of cmg 
in september  we completed the acquisition of deremate 
com de argentina sa  deremate 
com chile sa  interactivos y digitales m xico sa de sa and compa a de negocios interactiva de colombia eu for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we also purchased certain urls  domains  trademarks  databases and intellectual property rights related to those businesses for million 
on february   the purchase price allocation period ended and we agreed with the sellers to a working capital adjustment of  to be paid by the sellers to us 
reporting segments until the end of second quarter of  we had two reportable business segments marketplace and payments 
starting in the third quarter of  we have redefined our segment reporting and have eliminated the business segmentation between marketplace and payments to reflect changes in our business strategy and organization 
specifically  we are no longer charging buyers a separate fee for using the mercadopago payments platform for their purchases on the brazilian and argentine mercadolibre marketplace 
we are now offering this service for no added cost so as to encourage its adoption 
consequently  payments revenues are now generated exclusively on off platform or on consumer financing charges  neither of which are material enough as of the year ended december  to justify a stand alone reporting segment 
given these changes  starting in the third quarter of  our segment reporting is only based on geographic areas  this being the current criteria we are using to evaluate our segment performance 
our geography segments include brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries such as chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru  portugal and uruguay 
in addition  we operate a real estate classifieds platform that covers some areas of florida in the united states  the operations of which are included in our segment for other countries 
during  our gross merchandise volume reached  million and visitors to our web site were able to browse an average of over million listings on any given day  organized by country  in over  different product categories 
we believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers  sellers and product listings in most of the countries where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume 
at december   we had million confirmed registered mercadolibre users 
for  we had million unique sellers  million unique buyers and million successful items sold 

table of contents for  our net revenues were million 
of those million in revenues approximately were attributable to our brazilian business  to our argentine business  to our venezuelan business  to our mexican business  and to other countries 
although we discuss long term trends in our business  it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense 
we believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near term results difficult 
further  we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders 
we believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value 
we  therefore  encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock 
a long term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our company  which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us 
description of line items net revenues we recognize revenues in each of our five reporting segments 
our reporting segments include our operations in brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru  portugal and uruguay 
historically  we have generated revenues from the mercadolibre marketplace transacctions from listing fees  optional feature fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees 
during the third quarter of  we modified our pricing structure by replacing our previous listing fees and optional feature fees with consolidated up front fees which bundle these features 
we now offer three types of up front fees for three different combinations of placement and features 
up front fees are charged at the time the listing is uploaded onto our platform and are not subject to successful sale of the items listed 
following this fee structure modification  revenues for the mercadolibre marketplace transacctions are now generated by up front fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees 
as from the third quarter of  we offer payment processing through our mercadopago solution at no added cost in brazil and argentina 
this change in pricing implies that for marketplace transactions we no longer charge our users a specific fee for processing on platform payments as we did in the past 
we do continue  however  to generate payment related revenues  reported within each of our reporting segments  attributable to commissions charged to sellers for the use of the mercadopago platform with respect to transactions that occur outside of our marketplace platform  revenues from a financial charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our mercadopago platform  both on transaction occurs on or off our marketplace platform 

table of contents the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenues by country for each of  and year ended december  of total consolidated net revenues brazil argentina venezuela mexico other countries the following table summarizes the changes in net revenues for the years ended december   and year ended change from year ended change from to december  to december  in dollars in in dollars in in millions  except percentages net revenues brazil argentina venezuela mexico other countries total net revenues percentages have been calculated using whole dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table 
the table above may not total due to rounding 
we have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms 
for the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in our mercadolibre marketplace or our mercadopago payment solution 
our mercadolibre marketplace is available in thirteen countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  mexico  panama  peru  portugal  uruguay and venezuela  and mercadopago is available in six countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  mexico and venezuela 
the functional currency for each country s operations is the local currency  except for venezuela whose functional currency is the us dollar due to venezuela s status as a highly inflationary economy 
see critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation included in this report 
therefore  our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rate 
our subsidiaries in brazil  argentina  venezuela and colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues which are classified as costs of net revenues 
these taxes represented  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues primarily represents bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods  certain taxes on revenues  compensation for customer support personnel  isp connectivity charges  depreciation and amortization and hosting and site operation fees 
product and technology development expenses our product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization costs related to product and technology development  compensation for our engineering and web development staff  telecommunications costs and payments to third party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services to our company 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs for our platforms through online and offline advertising  bad debt charges  the salaries of employees involved in these activities  public relations costs  marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs 
we carry out the vast majority of our marketing efforts on the internet 
in that context  we enter into agreements with portals  search engines  social networks  ad networks and other sites in order to attract internet users to the mercadolibre marketplace and convert them into confirmed registered users and active traders on our platform 
additionally  we allocate a portion of our marketing budget to cable television advertising in order to improve our brand awareness and to complement our online efforts 

table of contents we also work intensively on attracting  developing and growing our seller community through our supply efforts 
we have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers  through trade show participation  seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff  compensation for outside directors  long term retention plan compensation  expenses for legal  accounting and other professional services  insurance expenses  office space rental expenses  travel and business expenses  as well as depreciation and amortization costs 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas of our company general management  finance  administration  accounting  legal and human resources 
compensation cost related to acquisitions as part of our acquisition of cmg  which closed in the first quarter of  we entered into a management escrow agreement to secure the obligations of the cmg shareholders that remained as managers 
we accrued those compensation expenses as operating expenses  instead of considering them part of the purchase price 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
other income expenses  net other income expenses consists of interest income derived primarily from our investments and cash equivalents  foreign currency gains or losses  the effect of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments  and other non operating results 
in addition  other income expenses included mainly interest expense related to the working capital requirements for our mercadopago operations through the second quarter of beginning in the third quarter of and as long as we continue pre selling credit card receivables there will be no interest expense included in other income expenses line 
income and asset tax we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states  as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate 
our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting 
therefore  our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable  if any given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry forwards  plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the following table summarizes the composition of our income asset taxes for the years ended december   and year ended december  in millions current federal foreign deferred federal foreign asset tax federal foreign income asset tax expense 
table of contents seasonality the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the twelve quarters set forth below quarter ended march  june  september  december  net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted 
table of contents seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and retail seasonality have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
typically  the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the christmas season 
however  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of were impacted by the global economic crisis and  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues  as a result of local currencies depreciating versus the us dollar during the period 
in addition  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of were impacted by the change in venezuelan translation rate as described in foreign currency translation below  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues 
our slowest period is typically the first quarter of the year 
the months of january  february and march normally correspond to summer vacation time in argentina  brazil  chile  peru and uruguay 
additionally  the easter holiday falls in march or april  and brazil celebrates carnival for one week in february or march 
this is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere  such as colombia  mexico and venezuela for which the slowest months are their summer months of july  august and september 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in with this report 
foreign currency translation historically  all of our foreign operations have used the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  these foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non functional currencies are recognized in earnings 
net foreign currency exchange losses or gains are included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption foreign currency gain loss 
until september   our venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expenses were translated at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to use the parallel exchange rate rather than the official exchange rate to translate our venezuelan financial statements 
the following facts and circumstances have been considered in our analysis of the applicable exchange rate at the date we changed the translation exchange rate and as of the date of this report  we have not obtained dividends remittances at the official exchange rate and we have not at the date of this report  the industry in which we operate may not influence our ability to access to the official exchange rate  the commission for the administration of foreign exchange cadivi volume of approvals of the use of the official rate was down on a year to year basis as of july cadivi has not only delayed approvals but also removed many items from priority lists current priorities appear to be food and medicine causing delays in the repatriation of dividends for many companies 

table of contents consequently  in the fourth quarter of  we translated our venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts using the parallel exchange rate 
as of the date of this report the company did not buy dollars at the cadivi official rate 
in accordance with us gaap  we have classified our venezuelan operations as highly inflationary as of january  and have used the us dollar to be the functional currency for purposes of our financial statements 
therefore  no translation effect was accounted for in other comprehensive income during the three and nine month periods ended september  related to our venezuelan operations 
until may   the only way by which us dollars could be purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities  including national public debt bonds dpns denominated in bolivares fuertes and bonds issued by the government that were denominated in us dollars 
this mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in venezuela that enabled entities to obtain foreign currency through financial brokers without going through cadivi 
although the parallel exchange rate was higher  and accordingly less beneficial  than the official exchange rate  some entities have used the parallel market to exchange currency because  as it was already mentioned  cadivi used not to approve in a timely manner the exchange of currency requested by such entities 
until may   our venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to buy us dollars and accordingly we used the parallel average exchange rate to re measure those foreign currency transactions 
however  on may th   the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations and close down such parallel market by declaring that foreign currency denominated securities issued by venezuelan entities were included in the definition of foreign currency  thus making the venezuelan central bank bcv the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds  thereby excluding non authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market 
trading of foreign currencies was re opened as a regulated market on june  with the venezuelan central bank as the only institution through which foreign currency denominated transactions can be brokered 
under the new system  known as the foreign currency securities transactions system sitme  entities domiciled in venezuela can buy us dollar denominated securities only through banks authorized by the bcv to import goods  services or capital inputs 
additionally  the sitme imposes volume restrictions on an entity s trading activity  limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of  per day  not to exceed  in a calendar month 
this limitation is non cumulative  meaning that an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next 
as a consequence of this new system  commencing on june   we have transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the sitme rate and started re measuring foreign currency transactions using the sitme rate published by bcv  which was bolivares fuertes per us dollar as of june  for the period beginning on may  and ended on june  during which there was no open foreign currency markets  we applied us gaap guidelines  which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date  the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could be made shall be used 
accordingly  the june  exchange rate published by the venezuelan central bank has been used to re measure transactions during the above mentioned period 
the net investment in the venezuelan subsidiaries  before intercompany eliminations  amounts to  and  as of december  and we have assessed the new regulations and have concluded that  as currently formulated  there has not been a material impact on the normal running of our business in venezuela 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired on this basis  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

table of contents goodwill and certain indefinite life trademarks are reviewed at the end of the year for impairment or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and certain trademarks are tested at the reporting unit level considering each segment of the company as a reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill and certain trademarks  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
cash flow projections used are based on financial budgets approved by management 
the growth rates applied do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates 
the average discount rate used is which reflects our real weighted average cost of capital 
key drivers in the analysis include confirmed registered users crus and gross merchandise volume gmv which represents a measure of the total us dollar amount of all transactions completed through the mercadolibre marketplace  excluding motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate  and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume 
in addition  the benchmark in the analysis includes a business to e commerce rate  which represents growth of e commerce as a percentage of gdp  internet penetration rates as well as trends in our market share 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and management s assessment of each reporting unit s fair value materially exceeds its carrying value 
as of december   there is no goodwill at reporting unit level that is at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is critical since it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because i it requires management to make assumptions about gross merchandise volume growth  future interest rates  sales and costs  and ii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income would be material 
management s assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks amounted to million at december   million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was due to change in our write off policy 
until  we write off accounts receivable with an aging of days or more  whereas  since we have written off accounts receivable with an aging of days or more 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts mainly relates to an increase in our net revenues 
in addition during we changed our billing cycle period 
in we billed to customers several times per month and in we billed to customers once a month 
the following table illustrates our bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues for  and year ended december  in millions  except percentages net revenues bad debt charges bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues historically  our actual losses have been consistent with our charges 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts and chargebacks is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis 
our management s assumptions about future collections require significant judgment 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our condensed consolidated statement of income 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances and historical information related to actions filed against the company at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in business legal proceedings  and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense could be costly and could divert management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay damages or modify our business practices 
any of these results could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income asset tax expense line in our consolidated statement of income

this amount was recorded as operating expense  instead of considering such payment as part of the purchase price see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the compensation expenses related to the acquisition were fully accrued in the second quarter of other income expenses  net year ended change from december  to in dollars in in millions  except percentages other income expenses as a percentage of net revenues the increase in other expenses during the year ended december  was primarily a result of an increase in interest expense and other financial charges from million in to million in the increase of interest expense was mainly attributable to a million increase in interest expenses from million for to million for  as a result of financing incurred to fund working capital needs in our payments operations in brazil and to a million increase from million in to million in related to the seller financing of the deremate acquisition 
in addition  other expenses grew due to a million increase in foreign currency losses  from million for to million in the increase in foreign currency losses was primarily due to losses in brazil attributable to the impact of the local currency appreciation on the cash balances held by our brazilian subsidiary in us dollars 
the interest expense and foreign losses increases were partially offset by a million increase in interest income and other financial charges to million in from million in the increase in interest income and other financial charges are mainly attributable to interest income from our investments and also to accrued gains related to changes in the fair value of put options 

table of contents income and asset tax expense year ended change from december  to in dollars in income and asset tax as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in our income and asset tax expense was driven by the reversal of certain foreign and domestic valuation allowances for million derived from our tax planning strategies implemented during the year designed to more efficiently use our accumulated tax loss carryforward credits from acquired companies 
we are still evaluating other tax planning strategies which at the date of this report are not considered feasible 
in addition  the decrease in our income and asset tax expense was a consequence of a million reduction of the impact of the mexican tax called impuesto empresarial a tasa nica ietu from million in to million in additionally  in year ended december   part of the foreign exchange losses in venezuela were not deductible and our blended tax rate was impacted by million of accrued compensation expenses related to cmg acquisition see compensation cost related to acquisitions above  as this charge reduced pre tax income  but the related tax credit had a full valuation allowance 
our blended tax rate is defined as income and asset tax expense as a percentage of income before income and asset tax 
our effective income tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax  and of the ietu tax 
the following table summarizes the changes in our blended and effective tax rate for the years ended december  and year ended december  blended tax rate effective tax rate factors affecting results of operations and financial condition our total net assets balances as of december  have increased as compared to december  as a result of our net income of the year in an amount of million and other movements affecting shareholders equity 
assets and liabilities balances relating to operations have in general changed in line and as a result of the increase in operations transactions volume and total value 
our gmv increased in  successful items sold increased and total volume payments increased 
assets and liabilities that changed for other reasons apart from the general trend of operations and non operating assets and liabilities changes were accounts receivables  net increased mainly as a result of a change in the billing cicle period 
in we billed to customers on a daily basis and in we billed to customers once a month 
other assets increased  due to an increase in vat related to the possession of the office building in argentina and an increase in withholding taxes 
deferred income tax increased mainly as a result of a reversal of the valuation allowance to net operating loss carryforwards in brazil for an amount of million 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce and emerging markets like latin america 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we must  among other things  maintain and increase the number of our confirmed registered users  items listed on our service and completed transactions  maintain and enhance our brand  implement and execute our business and marketing strategy successfully  continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  continue to enhance the mercadolibre and mercadopago services to meet the needs of a changing market  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
accordingly  we intend to invest heavily in marketing and promotion  site development  technology and operating infrastructure development and personnel 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing all of these goals  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents although we have experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of our confirmed registered users and items listed by our users in recent periods  such growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results have varied on an annual basis during our short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
the following list includes factors that may affect our operating results continued growth of online commerce and internet usage in latin america  our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies  governmental regulation in the countries where we operate  including exchange controls  litigation  legal liability and intellectual property rights enforcement  system interruptions or failures  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  the announcement or introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  and price competition  reliance on third party service providers  increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our web site  security breaches and consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the internet  consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of items  our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and increase revenues  seasonal fluctuations  and political  social and economic conditions in latin america  particularly venezuela  including foreign exchange rate fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund mercadopago financing operation in brazil 
we also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure  software applications and office space and will in the future require cash to pay dividends on shares of our common stock 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during the first two years of operations  from funds raised during our initial public offering  and from cash generated from our operations 
we have funded mercadopago by discounting credit card receivables  with loans backed with credit card receivables and through cash advances derived from our business 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments provided by cash generated from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  funds receivable from and payable to mercadopago users  and short term debt 
as long as we continue transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions in return for cash  as we have done since the last quarter of  we will continue generating cash 

table of contents in the event we change the way we manage our business  the working capital needs could be funded  as we did in the past  through a combination of the sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions  loans backed by credit card receivables and cash advances from our business

net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  resulted mainly from purchases of investments for million 
additionally  we used million of cash in the year ended december  to make capital expenditures related to technological equipment  software licenses and new office space and office equipment in argentina

additionally  purchases of investments for million were offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments for million as part of our financial strategy 

table of contents as of december   net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the payments for cmg and deremate acquisitions  net of cash acquired for million 
the purchase of deremate includes the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired of million  customer lists and non compete agreement net of tax of million and goodwill of million 
the related deremate acquisition outflow on our statement of cash flow does not include million of promissory notes issued to the seller 
the purchase of of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of cmg includes the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired of million  trademarks of million and goodwill of million 
the outflow shown in our statement of cash flow is net of million of cash acquired and does not consider million recorded as compensation expense and not as part of the purchase price see note to our consolidated financial statements and compensation cost related to acquisitions above 
additionally  purchases of investments accounted for million of cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   as part of our financial investment strategy and capital expenditures of million 
this consumption of cash was partially offset during the first nine months of by proceeds from the sale of investments for million also part of our financial strategy 
net cash used in financing activities year ended december  change from to in dollars in in millions  except percentages net cash used in financing activities percentages have been calculated using whole dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table 
for the year ended december   our primary use of cash for financing activities was a reduction in short term debt as we paid million of notes outstanding which were issued in connection with the deremate acquisition 
in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future  we may fund them with available cash  third party debt financing  or by raising equity capital  as market conditions allow 
year ended change from december  to in dollars in in millions  except percentages net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   our primary use of cash for financing activities was related to a reduction in short term debts related to a million payment of deremate acquisition seller financing 
for the year ended december   our primary use of cash for financing activities was a reduction in our financing from loans backed by payments credit card receivables 
since the fourth quarter of  we began to sell all the credit card coupons related to funds receivable from customers in our mercadopago business to financial institutions and accounted for as a sale of financial assets 
for that reason we no longer recognized the credit card portfolio as assets and no liability was recorded 
the difference in the accounting treatment generates a decrease in net cash used in financing activities 
in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future  we may fund them with available cash  third party debt financing  or by raising equity capital  as market conditions allow 

table of contents debt in connection with the deremate acquisition  on september   we issued to the seller ten unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on june   august   december  and march   we paid the sellers million  million  million and million  respectively  in full repayment of all outstanding principal and accrued interest 
as of december   we have no debt outstanding related to deremate acquisition 
as of december  the outstanding balance of the promissory notes was disclosed in our balance sheet for million as principal and million as interest accrued 
as of december   our outstanding debt of million is related to an argentine car lease contract 
see contratual obligations for more detail 
cash dividends in february  our board of directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend in our history of million on our outstanding shares of common stock 
the dividend is payable on april  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  we currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  any future determination as to the declaration of dividends on our common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures increased million  to million in as compared to million in the company increased the level of investment on hardware and software licenses necessary to increased and update the technology of our platform  cost of computer software developed internally and office equipment and new office space in argentina and brazil 
we anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures in the future as we strive to maintain our position in the latin american e commerce market 
in  our argentine subsidiary invested in a real estate trust 
the investment in this trust represents a beneficial ownership interest in  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina  where we expect to relocate our office headquarters upon completion of the building 
as of december   the argentine subsidiary has paid million into the trust and is expected to invest an additional million in order to cover higher construction costs in january certain of our officers and former officers also entered into an investment in a portion of the trust  which investment represents a beneficial ownership interest in a separate floor of the same building 
we do not intend to occupy the space to be owned by this group 
for us gaap purposes  the investment was recorded as a long term investment instead of as property and equipment through the second quarter of since august   this investment is accounted for as property and equipment because our argentine subsidiary received the certificate of possession of the building and started incurring in additional cost in order to bring the building into conditions of being used 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the sale of credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  property and equipment expenditures and to pay or repay obligations going forward 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing materially from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amount of payments 
below is a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the table 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payment due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total on february   our argentina subsidiary signed a company car lease contract to buy cars for certain employees of the company 
the total lease contract amounts to million and matures in july includes leases of office space 

table of contents we have leases for office space in certain countries in which we operate and leases for company cars in argentina 
these are our only operating leases 
purchase obligation amounts include a purchase obligation in the real estate trust for our new argentina office space  minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures technological equipment and software licenses and other goods and services that were entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we have developed estimates to project payment obligations based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations 
these market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the us dollar exchange rate with local currencies  particularly the brazilian reais due to brazil s share of our revenues  may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currencies risk at december   we hold cash and cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries  and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations 
our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in local currency 
as a result  our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency  except for our venezuelan subsidiaries which functional currency is the us dollar due to a highly inflationary accounting 
at december   the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  short term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  long term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled million and accounts receivable and funds receivable from customers in foreign currencies totaled million 
to manage exchange rate risk  our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into dollar denominated accounts in the united states 
at december   our dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and our dollar denominated long term investments totaled million 
for the year ended december   we incurred foreign currency losses in the amount of million as the cash and investment balances of the subsidiaries held in us dollars depreciated in local current terms 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the year ended december   compared to year ended december  other income expenses for more detail 
in accordance with us gaap  we have transitioned our venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as of january  and have been using the us dollar as the functional currency for these operations since then 
in accordance with us gaap  translation adjustments for prior periods were not removed from equity and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets at december   become the accounting basis for those assets 
monetary assets and liabilities in bolivares fuertes were re measured to the us dollar at the closing parallel exchange rate and the results of the operations in bolivares fuertes were re measured to the us dollars at the average monthly parallel exchange rate up to may  however  on may th   the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations and closed down the parallel market by declaring that foreign currency denominated securities issued by venezuelan entities were included in the definition of foreign currency  thus making the venezuelan central bank bcv the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds  thereby excluding non authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market 
trading of foreign currencies was re opened as a regulated market on june  with the bcv as the only institution through which foreign currency denominated transactions can be brokered 
under the new system  known as the foreign currency securities transactions system sitme  entities domiciled in venezuela can buy us dollar denominated securities only through banks authorized by the bcv to import goods  services or capital inputs 
additionally  the sitme imposes volume restrictions on an entity s trading activity  limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of  per day  not to exceed  in a calendar month 
this limitation is non cumulative  meaning that an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next 

table of contents as a consequence of this new system  commencing on june   we have transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the sitme rate and started re measuring foreign currency transactions using the sitme rate published by bcv  which was bolivares fuertes per us dollar as of june  for the period beginning on may  and ending on june  during which there was no open foreign currency markets we applied us gaap guidelines which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date  the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could be made shall be used 
accordingly  the june  exchange rate published by the venezuelan central bank has been used to re measure transactions during the abovementioned period 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a negative impact in our statement of income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a positive impact in our statement of income 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were denominated in brazilian reais  in argentine pesos  in venezuelan bolivares fuertes  in mexican pesos and in the currency of other countries 
the following table summarizes the distribution of net revenues by segment year ended december  in millions in millions  except percentages net revenues brazil argentina venezuela mexico other countries total net revenues percentages have been calculated using whole dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table 
the table above may not total due to rounding

the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies because the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars has a greater impact than the increase in net revenues  operating expenses  and other income expenses and income tax lines related to the translation effect 
similarly  the table above shows an increase in our net income when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars has a greater impact than the decrease in net revenues  operating expenses  and other income expenses and income tax lines related to the translation effect 
in the past we have entered into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure but during we did not enter into any such agreement 
interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates 
these changes can have an impact on our interest expenses derived from selling our mercadopago receivables 
at december   mercadopago funds receivable from customers totaled approximately million 
interest fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits  money market funds  investment grade corporate debt securities  and sovereign debt securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
because to all our long term investments do not exceed a two year period  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total fair market value of our portfolio as of december  or the cost derived from discounting our mercadopago receivables 
our short term and long term investments  which are classified on our balance sheet as current assets in the amount of million and as non current assets in the amount of million  respectively  can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
time deposits are considered held to maturity securities 
the book value of held to maturity securities approximates their respective fair values and consequently there are no significant unrecognized gains or losses
