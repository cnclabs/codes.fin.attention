we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and light based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide 
we offer easy to use products based on five platforms coolglide  xeo  solera  genesisplustm and excel vtm each of which enables physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe and effective aesthetic procedures for their customers 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  from where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research and development  regulatory  sales and marketing  service  and administrative activities 
in the united states  we market  sell and service our products through direct sales and service employees  and a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc pss  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical which has over sales representatives serving physician offices throughout the united states 
we also sell certain items such as our titan hand piece refills and marketing brochures online over the internet 
international sales are generally made through direct sales employees and a worldwide distributor network in over countries 
outside of the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  japan  spain  switzerland and the united kingdom 
products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  upgrades  service  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
product revenue represents the sale of a system 
a system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or light based module  control system software and high voltage electronics  as well as one or more hand pieces 
however  depending on the application  the laser or light based module is sometimes contained in the hand piece such as with our pearl and pearl fractional applications instead of within the console 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows 
this provides customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue which we classify as upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of pre paid service contract revenue and receipts for time and materials services on out of warranty products 
titan hand piece refill revenue is associated with our titan hand piece which requires replacement of the optical source after a set number of pulses have been used 
in japan  we distribute bioform  inc s bioform radiesse dermal filler product and obagi s cosmeceutical products 
significant business trends 
we believe that our ability to grow revenue has been  and will continue to be  primarily dependent on the following continuing to expand our product offerings 
ongoing investment in our global sales and marketing infrastructure 
use of clinical results to support new aesthetic products and applications 
enhanced luminary development and reference selling efforts to develop a location where our products can be displayed and used to assist in selling efforts 
customer demand for our products 
consumer demand for our products 
marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties  as well as outside those specialties 
generating ongoing revenue from our growing installed base of customers through the sale of service  upgrade  titan hand piece refill  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
our us revenue decreased by and our international revenue increased by in  compared to international revenue as a percent of total revenue was in and in we believe the decline in us revenues was attributable to several factors  including our products and upgrades asps in were lower than as a result of customers purchasing fewer applications for systems and lower pricing resulting from competitive discounting pressures 
we experienced a temporary decline in our titan refill revenue in  compared to  due to a voluntary recall of certain titan xl hand pieces 
all customers that had a titan xl hand piece subject to the recall  were provided with fully refilled hand pieces  which delayed their purchase of a refill 
our total international revenue increased by  with growth being sourced from most of the international locations that we sell in 
in japan  our revenue increased by in  compared to  as a result of growth from all of our product categories and the recently added dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals business 
with respect to australia  our revenue declined in by approximately due to being an unusually high revenue year in which a special tax incentive was offered by the government to incentivize customers to purchase capital equipment 
our service revenue remained relatively unchanged in  compared to service contract amortization is a primary component of total service revenue 
our installed base of customers continued to increase in albeit at a slower pace with a bias toward international 
our deferred service revenue balance decreased by million  or  to million as of december   compared to december  we believe the decline was attributable to in years prior to  we had discounted pricing promotions for incentivizing customers to purchase multiple year service contracts  however  in and we did not have such promotions 
a decrease in unit sales volume in but not in  which historically included an element of deferred revenue for service contracts beyond our standard warranty terms 
recently  fewer customers have been purchasing extended service contracts in response to improved product reliability and the recent tougher economic environment 
our gross margin in was  compared with in and in this decline was due to several factors  including the voluntary recall of certain titan xl hand pieces whereby eligible customers were provided with fully refilled hand pieces  a million  or  temporary decrease in our titan refill revenue in  compared to  for which we traditionally earn a higher gross margin than our blended total gross margin percentage  our asps have declined due primarily to customers purchasing fewer applications on their platforms and due to competitive discounting pressures  and a higher proportion of distributor revenue that carries a lower gross margin  partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses resulting from headcount reductions  and reduced warranty and service expenses as a result of improved product reliability for products other than titan xl hand pieces 
our sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat at million in  compared with million in as a percentage of net revenue  in sales and marketing expenses were at  compared to in this slight increase was primarily attributable to the lower revenue in the us in  compared to our research and development  or r d  expenses increased slightly to million in  compared with million in this increase was associated with higher personnel expenses resulting from higher headcount in engineering relating to new product development programs 
as a percentage of net revenue  r d expenses remained flat at in  compared to our general and administrative  or g a  expenses decreased by approximately  or  to million in  compared to as a percentage of net revenue  g a expenses decreased slightly to in  compared to in this decrease was due primarily to lower bad debt expenses  lower legal fees and litigation settlement costs 
in response to the economic conditions and a decline in revenue during  we reduced our company wide workforce by approximately and implemented other cost reduction measures in the first half of the headcount reductions impacted all departments and functions and resulted in restructuring charges of approximately  in first half of in  we settled our tcpa class action lawsuit and in that regard recorded a charge of  for the cost of the settlement  net of administrative expenses and amounts that were recovered from our insurance carrier 
see item legal proceedings in part i  of this form k 
factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our industry is highly competitive and our future performance depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our product offerings with innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to execute on the aforementioned initiatives  our business would be adversely affected 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of products  upgrades  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectability has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
fair value measurement of our long term auction rate securities investments we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars that represent investments in pools of student loan assets 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected our ars investments and auctions for some of our ars have continued to fail to settle on their respective settlement dates while some have been redeemed in full at their respective par values 
the current portfolio of investments shown as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements represents those investments that are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the issuer refinances their debt 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to to at december   total financial assets measured and recognized at fair value were million and of these assets  million  or  were ars that were measured and recognized using significant unobservable inputs level 
during   of ars were redeemed at their full par value  as a result we transferred from level assets  to cash and this resulted in a gain of  being recorded to accumulated comprehensive loss in as of december   we had million par value million fair value of long term ars investments 
the aggregate loss in value is included as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
given observable market information was not available to determine the fair values of our ars portfolio  we valued these investments based on a discounted cash flow model 
while our ars valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs pricing models  we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates 
the expected future cash flows of the ars were discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate that compensated for the illiquidity 
projected future cash flows over the economic life of the ars of approximately years were modeled based on the contractual penalty rates for the security added to a tax adjusted libor interest rate curve 
the discount rates that were applied to the cash flows were based on a premium over the projected yield curve and included an adjustment for credit  illiquidity  and other risk factors 
see note summary of significant accounting policies fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statement in part ii  item of this form k for more information 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the auctions for our ars investments continue to fail  and there is a further decline in their valuation  then we would have to i record additional reductions to the fair value of our ars investments  and ii record unrealized losses in our accumulated comprehensive income loss for the losses in value that are associated with market risk 
if the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary then we would have to record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the loss in value associated with the worsening of the credit worthiness credit losses of the issuer  which would reduce future earnings and harm our business 
recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments we review for impairments on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of such as temporary or other than temporary 
factors that we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  the investment before recovery 
beginning april   if an entity intends to sell  or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  an impaired debt security prior to recovery of its cost basis  the security is other than temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is required to be recognized as a loss through earnings 
otherwise  losses on securities which are other than temporarily impaired are separated into i the portion of loss which represents the credit loss  or ii the portion which is due to other factors 
the credit loss portion is recognized as a loss through earnings while the loss due to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes and related amortization 
at december   we had approximately million of par value ars investments on which we had recognized approximately million in unrealized other than temporary losses 
given we believed that such losses were not credit related  we have included them in accumulated comprehensive loss 
prior to april   all declines in fair value deemed to be other than temporary were reflected in earnings as realized losses 
with respect to the ars that we held as of april   we determined that the cumulative effect adjustment required to reclassify the non credit portion of previously recognized other than temporarily impaired adjustments was million 
therefore  we increased our accumulated earnings and decreased our accumulated other comprehensive income loss by the million cumulative effect adjustment 
stock based compensation expense employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
the expected volatility is a blend of implied and historical volatility 
we have determined that this is a more reflective measure of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility  than its limited historical volatility since the initial public offering of our common stock 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
as required under gaap  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
as of december   the unrecognized compensation cost  net of expected forfeitures  was million for stock options and stock awards and  for the employee stock purchase plan which will be recognized using the straight line attribution method over an estimated weighted average remaining amortization period of years and years  respectively 
see note stockholders equity  stock plans and stock based compensation expense  in the notes to consolidated financial statement in part ii  item of this form k for more information 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value and charged to cost of revenue to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory provisions that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product that has previously been reserved is sold 
warranty obligations we historically provided a standard one year or two year warranty coverage on our systems 
beginning in september  we changed our warranty policy to a one year standard warranty on all systems 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update based on historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 
provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes on earnings 
we perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of tax exempt interest income  foreign operations  research and development tax credits  state taxes  certain benefits realized related to stock option activity  and changes in valuation allowance 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
the effective tax rate for financial statement provision benefit purposes was approximately in  in  and in our future effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws  accounting principles  interpretations thereof  net operating loss carryback  research and development tax credits  and due to changes in the valuation allowance of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been  or are intended to be  indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
if the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted  a significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the allowable foreign tax credits 
it is not practical for us to determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings 
our deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  which assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in general  positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  and an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of our net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset 
in general  negative evidence may include a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years  and a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified and judgment must be used in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we considered available positive and negative evidence  giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carry back losses against prior taxable income and lesser weight to its projected financial results due to the challenges of forecasting future periods 
we also considered  commensurate with its objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences 
at the end of the quarter ended september   changes in previously anticipated expectations and continued operating losses resulted in a valuation allowance against our tax benefits since we no longer considered them more likely than not realizable 
we also performed this evaluation as of the year ended december  and determined the full valuation allowance was still required 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
through december   there have been no such impairments 
litigation we have been  and may in the future become  subject to legal proceedings related to securities litigation  intellectual property and other matters such as the tcpa litigation and the securities class action lawsuit described in item legal proceedings 
based on all available information at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable loss 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we record a reserve

this was attributable primarily to customers purchasing fewer applications for systems and lower pricing resulting from competitive discounting pressures 
though our unit sales of products and upgrades increased in  compared with  they declined in  compared to we experienced a temporary decline in our titan refill revenue in  compared to  due to a voluntary recall of certain titan xl hand pieces

in japan  our revenue increased by in  compared to  as a result of growth from all of our product categories and the recently added dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals business 
with respect to australia  our revenue declined in by approximately due to being an unusually high revenue year in which a special tax incentive was offered by the government to incentivize customers to purchase capital equipment 
the decline in our international revenue  compared to  was primarily attributable to the global recession that caused our current and prospective customers to be reluctant to spend significant amounts of money on capital equipment purchases during the unstable economic time 
revenue by product category our product revenue increased by in  compared to  and decreased by in  compared to the increase in product revenue was primarily attributable to revenue from the genesisplus product that was launched in the third quarter of the declines in product revenue  compared to  was primarily attributable to the global recession that caused our current and prospective customers to be reluctant to spend significant amounts of money on capital equipment purchases during the unstable economic times 
we believe that in and in  some of our us current and prospective customers that did not have established medical offices  continued to be reluctant to purchase capital equipment due to the general economic uncertainty and tight credit conditions 
upgrade revenue decreased by in both and  compared to the respective prior year periods 
in the past  we introduced new products that allowed existing customers to upgrade their previously purchased systems to take benefit of the additional capabilities 
however  in we introduced genesisplus a stand alone product and in we did not have a new product introduction  which resulted in the decline in our upgrade revenue 
further  our asps for upgrades declined in and  compared to the respective prior year periods  as a result of customers purchasing fewer handpieces and due to competitive discounting pressures

we recognized an income tax provision of million in  despite losses before taxes 
the provision was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance at the end of the third quarter of to reduce certain us federal and state net deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value  of which million related to our us deferred tax assets as of december  this valuation allowance was offset by million of certain tax benefits resulting from losses generated during fiscal that were carried back to prior periods 
asc requires the consideration of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets we considered available positive and negative evidence  giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carry back losses against prior taxable income and lesser weight to our projected financial results due to challenges of forecasting future periods 
we also considered  commensurate with its objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences 
at the end of the quarter ended september   revisions in previously anticipated expectations and continued operating losses resulted in a valuation allowance against our tax benefits since it was not considered more likely than not realizable 
we also performed this evaluation as of the years ended december  and and determined the full valuation allowance was still required 
under current tax laws  this valuation allowance will not limit our ability to utilize federal and state deferred tax assets provided we can generate sufficient future taxable income in the us we anticipate we will continue to record a valuation allowance against the losses of certain jurisdictions  primarily us federal and state  until such time as we are able to determine it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized 
such position is dependent on whether there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize such deferred tax assets 
we expect our future tax provisions benefits  during the time such valuation allowances are recorded  will consist primarily of the tax expense of our non us jurisdictions that are profitable 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss by jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
net loss and net loss per diluted share year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data change change net loss net loss per diluted share the million decrease in net loss  and decrease in net loss per diluted share in  compared to  was primarily attributable to a reduction in the tax provision by million  which was principally a function of the deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in lower operating expenses of  due primarily to the  litigation settlement expense in not being incurred in  offset by a decline in our gross profit by million and other income by  the million increase in net loss  and increase in net loss per diluted share in  compared to  was primarily attributable to lower revenue of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  fund the planned expansion of our operations and acquire businesses 
our sources of cash include operations  stock option exercises  and employee stock purchases 
we actively manage our cash usage and investment of liquid cash to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our daily needs 
the majority of our cash and investments are held in us banks and our foreign subsidiaries maintain a limited amount of cash in their local banks to cover their short term operating expenses

cash flows from investing activities we used net cash of million from investing activities in  which was primarily attributable to million in net proceeds from the sales and maturities of  of our ars investments and due to us diversifying out of municipal securities into other secure financial instruments  partially offset by million of cash used to purchase marketable investments  and  of cash used to purchase property and equipment

adequacy of cash resources to meet future needs we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable and long term investments of million as of december  of this amount  we had million invested in long term ars investments see critical accounting policies and estimates section above  for a full description of our long term investments in ars 
we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we have certain contractual arrangements that create potential risk for us and are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
discussed below are off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 
contractual obligations the following are our obligations for future minimum lease commitments related to facility leases as of december  payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as agreed between the parties 
these forecasted time horizons can vary among different suppliers 
our open inventory purchase commitments were not material at december  as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
income tax liability we have included in our consolidated balance sheet  in long term income tax liability with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest as of december  at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
other in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations  warranties  and indemnification obligations 
for example  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
our exposure under the various indemnification obligations is unknown and not reasonably estimable as they involve future claims that may be made against us 
as such  we have not accrued any amounts for such obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and municipal bonds  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single type of investment or issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for ars of generally less than eighteen months 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio would have potentially declined by approximately  as of december  we hold interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of student loans issued by the federal family education loan program 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for all of our investments in these securities failed until december  in and  approximately  and million  respectively of our original million par value portfolio has been redeemed in full and as of december  we had million par value fair value of million of long term ars  whose auctions continue to fail 
these investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the ars is refinanced by the issuer into another type of debt instrument 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to we currently classify all of these investments as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet because of our continuing inability to determine when these investments will settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments  united states treasury securities  municipal bonds  and eliminated investments in corporate debt 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include  duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the auctions for our ars investments continue to fail  and there is a further decline in the valuation  then we would have to i record additional reductions to the fair value of our ars investments  and ii record unrealized losses in our accumulated comprehensive income loss for the losses in value that are associated with market risk 
if the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary then we would have to record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the loss in value associated with the worsening of the credit worthiness credit losses of the issuer  which would reduce future earnings and harm our business 
foreign currency exchange risk we have international subsidiaries and operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
although the majority of our revenue and purchases are denominated in us dollars  we have revenue to certain international customers and expenses denominated in the japanese yen  euro  pounds sterling  australian dollars  swiss francs and canadian dollars 
the net gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities was a loss of approximately  in  which is included in our consolidated statements of operations 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense 
though to date our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments
