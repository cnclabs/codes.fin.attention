company overview we are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products and also operate service stations and convenience stores 
we own and operate two refineries with a total crude oil throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day  or bpd 
in addition to our  bpd refinery in el paso  texas  we own and operate a refinery near gallup  new mexico with a throughput capacity of approximately  bpd 
until september  we operated a  bpd refinery on the east coast of the united states near yorktown  virginia  and until november  we also operated a  bpd refinery near bloomfield  new mexico 
we temporarily suspended refining operations at our yorktown facility in september and we indefinitely suspended refining operations at the bloomfield refinery in november we continue to operate yorktown and bloomfield as product distribution terminals and supply refined products to those areas 
our primary operating areas encompass west texas  arizona  new mexico  utah  colorado  and the mid atlantic region 
in addition to the refineries  we also own and operate stand alone refined product distribution terminals in albuquerque  new mexico  yorktown  and bloomfield  as well as asphalt terminals in phoenix and tucson  arizona  albuquerque  and el paso 
as of december   we also own and operate retail service stations and convenience stores in arizona  colorado  and new mexico  a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports  and a wholesale petroleum products distributor  that operates in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  new mexico  texas  and utah 
on may   we completed the acquisition of giant 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we acquired of giant s  outstanding shares for per share in cash for a total purchase price of  million  funded primarily through a  million secured term loan 
in connection with the acquisition  we borrowed an additional million in july  when we paid off and retired giant s and senior subordinated notes 
prior to the acquisition of giant  we generated substantially all of our revenues from our refining operations in el paso 
with the acquisition of giant  we also gained a diverse mix of complementary retail and wholesale businesses 
following the acquisition of giant  we began reporting our operating results in three business segments the refining group  the wholesale group  and the retail group 
our refining group currently operates the two refineries and related refined product distribution terminals and asphalt terminals 
at the refineries  we refine crude oil and other feedstocks into finished products such as gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel  and asphalt 
our refineries market finished products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our wholesale group distributes gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant products 
our retail group operates service stations and convenience stores and sells gasoline  diesel fuel  and merchandise 
see note  segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for detailed information on our operating results by segment 

table of contents major influences on results of operations refining 
our net sales fluctuate significantly with movements in refined product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks  all of which are commodities 
the spread between crude oil and refined product prices is the primary factor affecting our earnings and cash flows from operations 
the cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined products that we ultimately sell depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the supply of and demand for crude oil  gasoline  and other refined products 
supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  availability of imports  marketing of competitive fuels  price differentials between heavy and sour crude oils and light sweet crude oils  known as the heavy light crude oil differential  and government regulation 
refining margins experienced extreme volatility throughout and refining margins were somewhat less volatile in gasoline margin averages have improved each year since and average diesel margins for showed improvement over levels 
another factor impacting our margins in recent years is the narrowing of the heavy light crude oil differential 
since the second quarter of  the heavy light crude oil differential has narrowed significantly  particularly impacting our yorktown refinery which  when operating  can process up to of heavy crude oil 
narrowing of the heavy light crude oil differential can have significant negative impact on our yorktown refining margins  as was the case during and in addition  we had changes in our lcm reserve of million related to our yorktown inventories that increased our cost of products sold for the year ended december  and decreased our cost of products sold for the year ended december  there were no such lcm reserve changes in the year ended december  other factors that impact our overall refinery gross margins are the sale of lower value products such as residuum and propane  particularly when crude costs are higher 
in addition  our refinery gross margin is further reduced because our refinery product yield is less than our total refinery throughput volume 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by our refineries direct operating expenses  especially the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months 
in addition  higher volumes of ethanol are blended with gasoline produced in the southwest region during the winter months  thereby increasing the supply of gasoline 
this combination of decreased demand and increased supply during the winter months can lower gasoline prices 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
the effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by increased demand during the winter months for diesel fuel in the southwest and heating oil in the northeast 
refining margins remain volatile and our results of operations may not reflect these historical seasonal trends 
safety  reliability  and the environmental performance of our refineries operations are critical to our financial performance 
unplanned downtime of our refineries  such as the unplanned weather related outage our el paso refinery experienced during february  generally results in lost refinery gross margin opportunity  increased maintenance costs  and a temporary increase in working capital investment and inventory 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime  such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project  through a planning process that considers product availability  margin environment  and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance 
periodically we have planned maintenance turnarounds at our refineries  which are expensed as incurred 
we shut down the south crude unit for days at the el paso refinery in the second quarter of and we performed a crude unit inspection outage for days at the yorktown refinery in october we completed a scheduled turnaround at the south side of the el paso refinery during the first quarter of our next scheduled maintenance turnarounds are during the first quarter of for el paso and the fourth quarter of for gallup 
the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
because crude oil and refined products are commodities  we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories 
our inventory of crude oil and the majority of our refined products are valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation methodology 
if the market values of our inventories decline below our cost basis  we would record a write down of our inventories resulting in a non 
table of contents cash charge to our cost of products sold 
market value declines during the year ended december  resulted in non cash charges to our cost of products sold of million 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
based on market conditions  we recorded non cash recoveries of million related to the lcm charges 
in addition  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil and other blendstocks  we experienced fluctuations in our lifo reserves between and we also experienced lifo liquidations based on decreased levels in our inventories 
these lifo liquidations resulted in decreases in cost of products sold of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and an increase of million in cost of products sold for the year ended december  see note  inventories  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the impact of lifo inventory accounting 
wholesale 
our earnings and cash flows from our wholesale business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricants sold 
margins for gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant sales are equal to the sales price less cost of sales 
margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
retail 
our earnings and cash flows from our retail business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel sold  and by the sales and margins of merchandise sold at our service stations and convenience stores 
margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes  and are measured on a cents per gallon  or cpg  basis 
fuel margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
margins for retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the merchandise  net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage  and are measured as a percentage of merchandise sales 
merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location  branding  and competition 
our retail sales are seasonal 
our retail business segment operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
goodwill impairment loss 
under our policy we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
various indications of possible goodwill impairment prompted us to perform goodwill impairment analyses at december  and march  we determined that no such impairment existed as of those dates 
our annual impairment test was performed as of june  the performance of the test is a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
from the first to the second quarter of  there was a decline in margins within the refining industry as well as a downward change in industry analysts forecasts for the remainder of and this  along with other negative financial forecasts released by independent refiners during the latter part of the second quarter of  contributed to declines in common stock trading prices within the independent refining sector  including declines in our common stock trading price 
as a result  our equity market capitalization fell below the net book value of our assets 
through the filing date of our second quarter of form q and through the end of the fourth quarter of  the trading price of our stock had experienced further reductions 
we completed step of the impairment test during the second quarter of and concluded that impairment existed 
consistent with the preliminary step analysis completed during the second quarter of  we concluded that our entire goodwill balance was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter of results of operations 
we finalized our step analysis during the third quarter of there were no such impairment charges in previous years 
long lived asset impairment loss 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

table of contents in order to test long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated  which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected volumes  margins  cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and operate the site as a product distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested our bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million of certain refinery related long lived and intangible assets  respectively  were impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million resulting from our fourth quarter analysis of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
based on the sustainable operational improvements of our gallup refinery during that were beyond what we had anticipated at the time of the bloomfield refinery idling  we determined that one of the three assets set aside for relocation to gallup was no longer required to attain our desired levels of production 
non cash impairment losses of million and million related to the long lived assets and certain intangible assets are included under other impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
factors impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 
senior secured notes  convertible senior notes  and equity offering during the second and third quarters of  we issued million in senior secured notes and million in convertible senior notes 
the senior secured notes consist of two tranches  the first consisting of million in fixed rate aggregate principal amount notes and the second consisting of million floating rate aggregate principal amount notes 
the interest rate on the floating rate notes was at issuance in june proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes  net of original issue and underwriting discounts were million 
the convertible senior notes consist of million in aggregate principal amount notes 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes were million  net of underwriting discounts 
during the second quarter of  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million 
the proceeds of this issuance were million  net of million in underwriting discounts 
the combined proceeds from the issuance and sale of the senior secured notes  the convertible senior notes  and our common stock were used to retire million of our outstanding indebtedness under our term loan credit agreement 
see note  long term debt  and note  stockholders equity  in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the issuance and composition of these notes 
asset impairments in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and maintain the site as a product distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested the bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million of certain bloomfield refinery related long lived and intangible assets  respectively  were impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million resulting from our fourth quarter analysis of specific assets that we had previously planned to 
table of contents relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
based on the current operations of the gallup refinery  we have determined that one of the three assets set aside for relocation to gallup is no longer required 
non cash impairment losses of million and million related to the long lived assets and certain intangible assets are included under other impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we completed an impairment analysis of the long lived assets at our flagstaff  arizona product distribution terminal following our permanent closure of the facility in the third quarter of the analysis determined that impairment existed  and we accordingly recorded a third quarter non cash impairment charge of million related to flagstaff terminal long lived assets 
this charge is included under other impairment losses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and as a result concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter results of operations 
this charge is included under goodwill impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  employee benefit plans we terminated our defined benefit plan covering certain el paso refinery employees during the termination resulted in a reduction to our related pension obligation of million with a corresponding reduction of million before the effect of income taxes to other comprehensive loss 
during  in connection with the temporary idling of our yorktown refinery and resultant termination of participants of the yorktown cash balance plan  we had distributed million from plan assets to plan participants 
as of december   the plan had not been terminated 
the curtailment resulted in increases to the related pension obligation of million and to other comprehensive loss before income taxes of million 
subject to a memorandum of understanding between western refining yorktown  inc and the local union representing the yorktown refinery employees  eligible terminated employees  both bargained for and non bargained for  were given the option of receiving severance pay or coverage under the yorktown retiree medical plan  but not both 
the resulting choices made by the terminated employees reduced our benefits obligation by million as of december  currently  we do not plan to terminate the yorktown retiree medical plan 
write off of unamortized loan fees during the second and third quarters of  we made principal payments on our term loan of million primarily from the net proceeds of our debt and common stock offerings 
accordingly  we expensed million during the second quarter of to write off a portion of the unamortized loan fees related to the term loan 
in june  we amended our revolving credit agreement and term loan 
as a result of such amendment  we recorded an expense of million related to the write off of deferred loan fees incurred in may we completed an additional amendment to our revolving credit agreement in december we will amortize all fees incurred as a result of this amendment  along with all unamortized loan fees related to the revolving credit agreement prior to this amendment  ratably through the amended maturity date of january see note  long term debt  in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on our long term debt 
environmental cost recoveries  property tax refunds  and other during the latter part of march  we reversed million related to our accrued bonus for this revision of our bonus estimate reduced direct operating expenses and selling  general  and administrative expenses for by million and million  respectively 
during  we recovered million from various third parties related to environmental costs recorded during and prior years 
these recoveries are included in direct operating expenses reported for the year ended december  additionally  during  we decreased our property tax expense estimate by million resulting from revised el paso property appraisal rolls for through the revision to the property appraisal rolls also resulted in a refund of million from 
table of contents various taxing authorities  further reducing our property tax expense for a total decrease of million for the year ended december  we also recorded a fourth quarter legal settlement charge of million 
planned maintenance turnaround during and  we incurred costs of million and million  respectively for maintenance turnarounds 
primarily during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred costs of million in a crude unit shutdown and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the first quarter of at the el paso refinery  and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the third quarter of at the yorktown refinery  which was subsequently cancelled 
the maintenance turnaround was performed during the fourth quarter at the north side of the el paso refinery 
our next scheduled maintenance turnarounds are during the first quarter of for el paso and the fourth quarter of for gallup 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
most of our competitors  however  capitalize and amortize maintenance turnarounds 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
in order to apply these principles  we must make judgments  assumptions  and estimates based on the best available information at the time 
actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events  some of which we may have little or no control over 
our critical accounting policies  which are discussed below  could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements 
inventories 
crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally under the lifo valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues 
ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net realizable market values and charged to cost of products sold in the period recorded 
in subsequent periods  a new lower of cost or market determination is made based upon current circumstances 
we determine market value inventory adjustments by evaluating crude oil  refined products  and other inventories on an aggregate basis by geographic region 
aggregated lifo costs were less than the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories by million at december  retail refined product fuel inventory values are determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
retail merchandise inventory value is determined under the retail inventory method 
wholesale finished product  lubricant  and related inventories are determined using the fifo inventory valuation method 
finished product inventories originate from either our refineries or from third party purchases 
maintenance turnaround expense 
the units at our refineries require periodic maintenance and repairs commonly referred to as turnarounds 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit but generally is every two to six years depending on the processing unit involved 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
these costs are identified as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets 
when assets are placed in service  we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives 
for assets to be disposed of  we report long lived assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in order to test our long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated  which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the 
table of contents asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
the economic slowdown that began in and continued into has reduced demand for refined products  thereby putting significant pressure on refined product margins 
beginning in the second quarter of  heavy light crude oil differentials have narrowed significantly 
narrow heavy light crude oil differential has negatively impacted the results of operations of our yorktown refinery 
due to these economic conditions  at december   we performed an impairment analysis of our yorktown long lived and intangible assets 
this analysis indicated that the december  carrying value of our yorktown long lived assets was recoverable 
continuing losses due to narrow heavy light crude oil differentials  poor coking economics  changes in yorktown crude oil purchase contract terms  and potentially significant regulatory capital spending requirements caused us to temporarily suspend our yorktown refining operations during the third quarter of accordingly  we revised our cash flow forecasts used in our analysis for long lived asset impairment at our yorktown refinery to reflect these changes in operations at the yorktown facility as of june  the revised cash flows used in our june  impairment analysis assumes that refining operations will be temporarily suspended  that our yorktown facility will be operated as a refined product terminal in the near term  and that restart activities will begin no later than the middle of our revised forecast includes estimates and assumptions that require considerable judgment and are based on our historical production volumes and throughputs  industry analysts margin forecasts  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
based on our analysis  we determined that the undiscounted forecasted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of our yorktown long lived and intangible assets as of june  no significant changes have occurred since we performed our analysis that would require us to revise our june  analysis 
the carrying value of the long lived assets related to refining operations that were temporarily idled could be subject to impairment 
we currently anticipate a six to nine month pre restart maintenance period will be required before our yorktown refinery can be restarted  at an estimated cost of at least million  which includes a maintenance turnaround 
if our current plans to restart refining operations at our yorktown facility within the next two to three years change  the likelihood of impairment of the long lived assets and certain intangible assets related to the refinery operations will increase 
impairments related to yorktown could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the carrying value of total long lived and intangible assets at yorktown as of december  was million  of which million related to our yorktown refining assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and maintain the site as a product distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested the bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million  respectively  of impairment losses existed in certain bloomfield refinery related long lived and intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million resulting from our fourth quarter analysis of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
based on sustainable operational improvements at our gallup refinery during that were beyond what we had anticipated at the time of the bloomfield refinery idling  we determined that one of the three assets set aside for relocation to gallup was no longer required to attain our desired levels of production 
non cash impairment losses of million and million related to the long lived assets and certain intangible assets are included under other impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we currently plan to relocate and place the remaining bloomfield refining assets with a net book value of million at december  into service at the gallup refinery during the maintenance turnaround scheduled for during the third quarter of  we permanently closed our product distribution terminal in flagstaff  arizona 
we completed an impairment analysis of our flagstaff terminal long lived assets and determined from this analysis that the assets were fully impaired 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million related to our flagstaff long lived assets is included in other impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is carried at cost 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment if any events and circumstances arise during a quarter that indicates goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
within our refining segment  we have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
our wholesale and retail segments are considered reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
our goodwill was assigned to two of our three refining reporting units and to our wholesale and retail reporting units 
we do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes 
various indications of possible goodwill impairment prompted us to perform goodwill impairment analyses at december  and march  we determined that no such impairment existed as of those dates 
our annual impairment test was performed as of june  the performance of the test is a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
from the first to the second quarter of  there was a decline in margins within the refining industry as well as a downward change in industry analysts forecasts for the remainder of and this  along with other negative financial forecasts released by independent refiners during the latter part of the second quarter of  contributed to declines in common stock trading prices within the independent refining sector  including declines in our common stock trading price 
as a result  our equity market capitalization fell below the net book value of our assets 
through the filing date of our second quarter form q and through the end of the fourth quarter of  the trading price of our stock had experienced further reductions 
we completed step of the impairment test during the second quarter of and concluded that impairment existed 
we finalized our step analysis during the third quarter of consistent with the preliminary step analysis completed during the second quarter of  we concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter of results of operations 
we had no such impairment charges during or we amortize intangible assets  such as rights of way  licenses  and permits over their economic useful lives  unless the economic useful lives of the assets are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is determined to be indefinite  then that asset is not amortized 
we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset when the intangible asset is acquired 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our existing intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
environmental and other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities for loss contingencies  including environmental remediation costs  when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
environmental costs are expensed if they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations with no future economic benefit 
estimates of projected environmental costs are made based upon internal and third party assessments of contamination  available remediation technology  and environmental regulations 
loss contingency accruals  including those for environmental remediation  are subject to revision as further information develops or circumstances change and such accruals can take into account the legal liability of other parties 
as a result of purchase accounting related to the giant acquisition  the majority of our environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of giant are recorded on a discounted basis 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate is used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than other  the lower end of the range is used 
possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the financial statements until they become probable 
legal costs associated with environmental remediation are included as part of the estimated liability 
we have million accrued at december  for environmental obligations 

table of contents asset retirement obligations aro 
the estimated fair value of an aro is based on the estimated current cost escalated by an inflation rate and discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this liability is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized using the straight line method 
the liability accretes until we settle the liability 
legally restricted assets have been set aside for purposes of settling certain of the aro liabilities 
financial instruments and fair value 
we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices 
we use commodity future contracts  price swaps  and options to reduce price volatility  to fix margins for refined products  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and blendstock inventories 
all derivatives entered into by us are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and those instruments are measured at fair value 
we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for these instruments for financial accounting purposes 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are recognized within cost of products sold using mark to market accounting 
pension and other postretirement obligations 
pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  future compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  health care cost trends  and demographic data 
changes in our actuarial assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control and can have a significant effect on our pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs 
a defined benefit postretirement plan sponsor must a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or liability for the plan s underfunded status  b measure the plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  as a component of other comprehensive income  the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
stock based compensation 
the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments awarded under the western refining long term incentive plan is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of each share of restricted stock awarded is measured based on the market price at closing as of the measurement date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting 
we believe that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on our accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows when implemented

this decrease was partially offset by higher merchandise and fuel margins for the year ended december   compared to the same period in outlook the weak global economy over the past two years has resulted in decreased demand for refined products 
the decreased demand along with narrowing differentials between light and heavy crude oil prices negatively impacted our refining margins through the first quarter of and all of beginning in the second quarter of  our refining margins improved due to increased demand  primarily for diesel fuel 
during the early part of  our refining margins have continued to strengthen  partially due to increased gasoline crack spreads as we approach the spring driving season  continued strong diesel demand  and a supply demand imbalance of wti crude oil in the mid continent  resulting in historically low prices for wti crude oil relative to brent crude oil 
this is a positive development for us as all of our crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to wti

working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities  existing cash balances  and our revolving credit agreement 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
the improved refining margin environment during  compared to the fourth quarter of  positively impacted our earnings and cash flows 
our refining gross margin increased from per throughput barrel in the fourth quarter of to per throughput barrel for the year ended december  refining margins were extremely volatile throughout for example  our refining margin per throughput barrel decreased from in the first quarter of to   and in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  respectively 
these changes in refining margins are attributable to the spread between crude oil and refined product prices 
if our margins deteriorate significantly  or if our earnings and cash flows suffer for any other reason  we could be unable to comply with the financial covenants set forth in our credit facilities described below 
if we fail to satisfy these covenants  we could be prohibited from borrowing for our working capital needs and issuing letters of credit  which would hinder our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at planned rates 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or if we are unable to borrow or issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  we would need to seek additional financing  if available  in order to operate our business 
we continually evaluate additional alternatives to further improve our capital structure by increasing our cash balances and or reducing or refinancing a portion of the remaining balance on our term loan 
these alternatives include various strategic initiatives and potential asset sales as well as potential public or private equity or debt

regulatory projects 
regulatory projects are undertaken to comply with various regulatory requirements  including those related to environmental  health  and safety matters 
our low sulfur fuel and low benzene gasoline projects are regulatory investments  driven primarily by fuels regulations 
we completed our capital project to comply with the epa s low sulfur gasoline regulations during our gallup and yorktown refineries require no further regulatory spending to meet the epa s ultra low sulfur diesel standards 
the deadline for compliance with the final phase of the ultra low sulfur diesel regulations to reduce sulfur in locomotive and marine diesel is june and affects our el paso refinery only 
epa regulations allow the one time use of credits to extend the june deadline by up to months 
low sulfur credits purchased in will allow our el paso refinery to continue producing ppm sulfur locomotive diesel until early we are evaluating the need for a capital project to produce ppm locomotive diesel after early all of our refineries are required to meet the new mobile source air toxics  or msat ii  regulations to reduce the benzene content of gasoline 
under the msat ii regulations  benzene in the finished gasoline pool must be reduced to an annual average of volume percent by with or without the purchase of credits 
beginning on july   each refinery must also average volume percent benzene without the use of credits

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk changes in commodity prices and interest rates are our primary sources of market risk 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations 
our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices  which depend on many factors  including demand for crude oil  gasoline  and other refined products  changes in the economy  worldwide production levels  worldwide inventory levels  and governmental regulatory initiatives 
our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations 
in order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility  we have generally applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level 
in the past  circumstances have occurred  such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level 
we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances 
we maintain inventories of crude oil  other feedstocks and blendstocks  and refined products  the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic conditions  regional and global inventory levels  and seasonal conditions 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   aggregated lifo costs exceeded the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories by million 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   aggregated lifo costs exceeded the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories by million 
all commodity futures contracts  price swaps  and options are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recorded under cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of operations 
we selectively utilize commodity derivatives to manage our price exposure to inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes 
the commodity derivative instruments may take the form of futures contracts  price swaps  or options and are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for these instruments for financial accounting purposes 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are reflected within cost of products sold at the end of each period 
for the years ended december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in net losses settled or accounted for using mark to market accounting
