garmin s fiscal year is a week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
fiscal years   and contained weeks 
unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to the company s fiscal year and fiscal periods 
unless the context otherwise requires  references in this document to we  us  our and similar terms refer to garmin ltd 
and its subsidiaries 
unless otherwise indicated  dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands  except per share data 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation  communications and information devices  most of which are enabled by global positioning system  or gps  technology 
we operate in four business segments  which serve the marine  outdoor fitness  automotive mobile  and aviation markets 
our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors 
however  the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly 
as such  the segments are managed separately 
our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine  recreation fitness and automotive mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets 
our aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 
since our first products were delivered in  we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 
our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of since and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of since the vast majority of this growth has been organic  only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of dynastream innovations inc in  digital cyclone  inc and the assets of nautamatic marine systems  inc in  eleven european distributors between and  and metrigear  inc in these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 
since our principal locations are in the united states  taiwan and the uk  we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results 
the table below provides a listing of our functional currency by subsidiary excluding the european subsidiaries that utilize the euro 
garmin europe ltd us dollar garmin corporation taiwan dollar garmin international us dollar garmin norge norwegian kroner dynastream innovations canadian dollar garmin danmark danish krone garmin sweden swedish brona garmin australasia australian dollar garmin polska polish zloty garmin japan japanese yen garmin china chinese renminbi approximately of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro 
we experienced million  million  and million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date we purchased shares in tele atlas nv in october and the tender of shares in february  march  and june to date  we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency  and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  garmin evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
for the large majority of garmin s sales  these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
the company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales 
garmin introduced n maps lifetime in january  which is a single fee program that  subject to the program s terms and conditions  enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd 
the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n maps lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the currently estimated month life of the products 
for multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
in addition to the products listed below  the company has offered certain other products that involve multiple element arrangements that are immaterial 
in  garmin began offering pnds with lifetime map updates lmu bundled in the original purchase price 
similar to n maps lifetime which was introduced in january  this enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd 
the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds including lmu 
the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the lmu 
the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined primarily using vsoe 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the lmu are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated month life of the products 
in addition  garmin offers pnds with premium traffic bundled in the original purchase price in the european market 
the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds including premium traffic 
the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the premium traffic service 
the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using vsoe 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated month life of the products 
in  garmin introduced the n vi  a premium pnd with a built in wireless module that lets customers access garmin s n link service  which provides direct links to certain online information 
the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the n vi the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the n link service 
the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using vsoe 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the n link services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the month life of the service 
garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates  price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases  promotions and other volume based incentives 
the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin s operating results 
these incentives are reviewed periodically and  with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions  are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis 
if market conditions were to decline  garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
garmin records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on garmin s historical experience 
trade accounts receivable we sell our products to retailers  wholesalers  and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition 
we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
typically  our accounts receivable are collected within days and do not bear interest 
we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments 
we determine these allowances by evaluating the aging of our receivables  and reviewing our high risk customers 
past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due 
warranties garmin s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years 
garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventory garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
fair value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
income taxes garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
it is garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
stock based compensation garmin awards stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock units rsus and or performance shares each year as part of garmin s compensation package for employees 
employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock options  sar grants  rsu grants and or performance shares but the granting of options  sars  rsus and or performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting terms and characteristics net sales our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers 
refer to the revenue recognition discussion above 
our sales are largely of a consumer nature  therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results 
we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive  and we typically ship most orders within hours 
net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
typically  sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter  due to increased demand during the spring and summer season  and in the fourth quarter  due to increased demand during the holiday buying season 
our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation  but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 
cost of sales gross profit raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment declined basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines 
in addition  the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix shifted toward products bundled with lifetime maps 
see note for further information 
this was partially offset by a positive refinement in the warranty reserve 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment increased basis points as benefits from raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment declined basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lower margin product groups 
these impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines  most significantly flash memory 
gross margins for the aviation  marine  and outdoor fitness segments are more stable 
our long term gross margin targets are  and  respectively  for these segments 
our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and  where possible  to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components 
we believe that because of our practice of performing the design  manufacture and marketing of our products in house  our sijhih  jhongli  and lin kou manufacturing plants in taiwan  our olathe  kansas  and salem  oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing 
in general  products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products 
our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 
sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit 
in the past  prices of our devices sold into the automotive mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points 
the average selling prices of our aviation  outdoor fitness  and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices 
the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gps enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 
advertising expense our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners 
as revenues grew in  advertising expense also increased 
in  we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of gps technology 
the reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share 
we expect advertising costs to decrease in as revenues decline 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  marketing  and other brand building costs  accounting and legal costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to legal costs  fees associated with the swiss redomestication  and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users 
due to the economic pressure on our consumer oriented business  we decreased selling  general and administrative expenses in as revenues grew in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs  excluding advertising  to be stable or decline slightly in as revenues decline 
research and development the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers  costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development 
approximately of the research and development of our products is performed in north america 
the remainder of our research and development activities is performed primarily by our taiwan engineering group 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gps enabled devices 
we expect our research and development budget in absolute terms to be stable in customers our top ten customers have contributed between and of net sales since we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between and days since we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix  longer payment terms  and macroeconomic conditions 
we expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers 
income taxes we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates 
in particular  the profit entitlement afforded our swiss based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain high technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate 
as a result  our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately during the negative rate was due to the impact of one time items booked in the one time items of million include the release of uncertain tax position reserves from to related to our settlement with the irs in the us  partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the tax year in the us and taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves 
without one time items  we would have reported an effective tax rate of for compared to for this increase resulted from an unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 
we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal  there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
therefore  the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be higher than fiscal the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins  production volume  additional capital investments made during fiscal  and the composition of our earnings

the decrease occurred in automotive mobile and was partially offset by revenue growth in outdoor fitness  marine and aviation 
the outdoor fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 
automotive mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix  but declined from in to in total unit sales decreased to million units in from million units in the declining unit sales volume in was attributable to a decline in automotive mobile units due to increased saturation in the segment and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor fitness  marine and aviation segments 
automotive mobile segment revenue declined in  as the average selling price and volumes declined and  respectively 
outdoor fitness segment revenue increased on the strength of recent product introductions that expand the addressable market and ongoing global penetration 
marine revenues increased due to product introductions  slight industry recovery and market share gains 
aviation revenues increased as the company delivered into additional cockpits and the retrofit business began to recover 
the company anticipates ongoing revenue declines in driven by the automotive mobile segment with partially offsetting growth in the outdoor fitness  aviation and marine segments 
in general  management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 
cost of goods sold weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year cost of goods of revenues cost of goods of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total cost of goods sold decreased in when compared to the year ago period which was generally consistent with the change in revenue 
the absolute dollar decrease occurred in automotive mobile and was partially offset by cost of goods increases in outdoor fitness  marine and aviation 
cost of goods sold in was positively impacted by basis points due to a million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve 
this adjustment impacted all segments with automotive mobile  outdoor fitness and marine having the largest benefits 
cost per unit declined in all segments driving stable to improving margins in outdoor fitness  marine and aviation 
management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be stable in given current component pricing 
gross profit weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year gross profit of revenues gross profit of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total gross profit dollars in decreased while gross profit margin percentage increased basis points compared to gross profit margins were stable to increasing in all segments excluding the automotive mobile segment when compared to the automotive mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decrease of basis points was driven by an decrease in average selling price which was only partially offset by a decline in per unit costs including the warranty benefit 
gross profit dollars of the automotive mobile segment declined to of total gross profit dollars from in gross profit dollars for marine increased compared to due to product mix shifting toward higher margin units 
gross profit dollars for outdoor fitness increased by to million due to strong revenue growth in the segment 
management believes that total company gross margins will be stable in as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles offsetting continued margin pressure in the automotive mobile segment due to price declines 
advertising expenses weeks ended december  weeks ended december  advertising advertising year over year expense of revenues expense of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total advertising expense decreased in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to as a percent of revenues  advertising expenses were in both and the absolute dollar decrease occurred primarily in the automotive mobile segment due to reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners partially offset by mobile handset specific advertising 
further offsetting the decline was increased advertising for outdoor fitness where we continue to invest for growth

expenses of revenues admin 
expenses of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total selling  general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to as a percent of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of revenues in to of revenues in the expense increase was primarily driven by legal costs  fees associated with the swiss redomestication  and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users 
aviation costs declined year over year due to a bad debt accrual driven by cash collection risks associated with several of our customers that did not reoccur in management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decline in absolute dollars but to increase as a percentage of sales in as revenue declines outpace cost reductions 
research and development expense weeks ended december  weeks ended december  research research year over year development of revenues development of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total research and development expense increased due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative which has now been cancelled  and the addition of over new engineering personnel to our staff during the period 
in absolute dollars  research and development costs increased million primarily in the auto mobile segment  when compared with the year ago period and increased basis points as a percent of revenue 
management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation  development  and introduction of new products 
management expects that its research and development expenses will be stable during fiscal on an absolute dollar basis in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies 
operating income weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year operating income of revenues operating income of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total operating income decreased basis points as a percent of revenue and in absolute dollars when compared to the year ago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses 
the automotive mobile operating margin declined from in to in due to a basis point decline in gross margins and selling  general and administrative and research and development expense increases during a period of declining revenues 
the aviation operating margin increased from in to in as gross margins improved basis points other income expense weeks ended weeks ended december  december  interest income interest expense foreign currency exchange gain loss on sale of marketable securities other total other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expense was lower in fiscal relative to fiscal  with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in interest income for fiscal increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year partially offset by decreasing interest rates 
foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound sterling 
due to the relative size of entities using other currencies  movements are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the euro is the functional currency of all subsidiaries excluding those shown below 
as subsidiaries have grown  currency moves generated material gains and losses 
additionally  euro based inter company transactions in garmin ltd 
can also generate currency gains and losses 
the million currency loss in was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling  as well as the weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar 
during  the us dollar strengthened and compared to the euro and the british pound sterling  respectively  resulting in a loss of million 
a loss of million resulted due to the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar 
the movements of the taiwan dollar and euro british pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non functional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue 
the remaining net currency gain of million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 
the million currency loss in was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro  the british pound sterling and the taiwan dollar 
during  the us dollar weakened and compared to the euro and the british pound sterling  respectively  resulting in a gain of million 
a loss of million resulted due to the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar 
the remaining net currency gain of million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 
income tax provision our earnings before taxes fell when compared to and our income tax expense decreased by million  to million  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the significant decline in income tax expense was due to the impact of one time items booked in the one time items of million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from to related to our settlement with the irs in the us  partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the tax year in the us and taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves 
without one time items  we would have reported an effective tax rate of for compared to for the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate as compared to is largely due to an unfavorable mix of income among taxing jurisdictions

the decrease occurred across all segments  except outdoor fitness  with the greatest decreases in the automotive mobile and aviation segments 
automotive mobile revenue was the largest portion of our revenue mix  but declined from in to in total unit sales decreased to million in from million in the lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all segments  excluding outdoor fitness  with the greatest percentage declines occurring in aviation and marine 
the lower volumes were driven primarily by the macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail partners 
automotive mobile segment revenue declined in as the average selling price declined and volumes declined 
average selling price declines continue to be attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotive mobile products compete 
the aviation and marine segments declined and  respectively in  as both industries experienced significant slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic conditions 
outdoor fitness segment revenue increased due to new product introductions  including the dakota series  the forerunner cx  the forerunner xt and edge  and increasing global penetration of the fitness category 
all segments showed improving trends in the second half of as the macroeconomic conditions improved 
cost of goods sold weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year cost of goods of revenues cost of goods of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total cost of goods sold decreased in when compared to due primarily to the decline in revenue 
in addition  cost per unit declined in all segments driving cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue lower due to material cost reductions 
this savings was partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiatives 
gross profit weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year gross profit of revenues gross profit of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the automotive mobile and aviation segments where the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross margins earned 
gross profit margin percentage for the company overall increased basis points as margins expanded in all segments 
the automotive mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of basis points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price declines 
outdoor fitness gross margin increased principally due to a newer suite of higher margin products 
gross profit margin percentage for marine and aviation increased compared to due to increased average selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material cost reductions 
advertising expenses weeks ended december  weeks ended december  advertising advertising year over year expense of revenues expense of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total advertising expense decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to as a percent of sales  advertising expenses declined to in compared to in the decrease was a result of actions taken by the company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising which is tied to net sales levels

expenses of revenues admin 
expenses of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total selling  general and administrative expense decreased in while it increased as a percentage of sales compared to as costs throughout the company were reduced but not as rapidly as the revenue declines 
the decline in costs was primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in as a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support and information technology 
the increased expense for the outdoor fitness segment and the decreased expense for the automotive mobile segment were driven by the allocation of costs based on revenues 
as outdoor fitness revenues have increased as a percentage of revenues  additional selling  general and administrative expenses are shifted to the segment 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to of sales in  as revenues declined 
research and development expense weeks ended december  weeks ended december  research research year over year development of revenues development of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total the increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative  the addition of new engineering personnel to our staff during the period  and an increase in engineering program costs in as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation 
operating income weeks ended december  weeks ended december  year over year operating income of revenues operating income of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total operating income increased basis points as a percent of revenue but decreased in absolute dollars when compared to the year ago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased research and development expenses 
other income expense weeks ended weeks ended december  december  interest income foreign currency exchange gain on sale of marketable securities other total other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expense was lower in fiscal relative to fiscal  with the majority of this difference caused by a large gain on sale of equity securities in interest income for fiscal decreased due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances 
the million currency loss in was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro  the british pound sterling and the taiwan dollar 
during  the us dollar weakened and compared to the euro and the british pound sterling  respectively  resulting in a gain of million 
a loss of million resulted due to the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar 
the relative weakness of the taiwan dollar and euro british pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue 
the remaining net currency gain of million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 
the million currency loss in was related to the strengthening of the us dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our tele atlas nv shares 
during  the taiwan dollar weakened in comparison to the us dollar  resulting in a million gain 
the euro weakened and the british pound sterling weakened relative to the us dollar in which resulted in a million loss 
offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october to the dates of tender in february  march  and june other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of million 
gain on sale of equity of securities of million in was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in tele atlas nv which we acquired in in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares  which was subsequently abandoned 
income tax provision our fiscal earnings before taxes fell when compared to  while our income tax expense decreased 
income taxes fell million  to million  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in tax rate is due to the favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired 
net income as a result of the various factors noted above  net income decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources net cash generated by operations was million   million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
primary drivers of the cash generation in included million of net income with non cash adjustments for depreciation amortization of million  foreign currency unrealized losses of million  stock compensation expense of million  million related to decreased accounts receivable as sales levels have declined and million of sales for which cash was received but revenue was deferred as required by our revenue recognition policies 
this cash generation was partially offset by uses of cash including a million reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities related primarily to the timing of royalty payments and the million reversal of tax reserves associated with both release of uncertain tax position reserves from to related to our settlement with the irs in the us and expiration of statute of limitations  a million reduction in accounts payable primarily in our taiwan manufacturing operations due to timing of payments  and a million increase in inventories following a low inventory level exiting the decline in cash flow from operations over levels was due to reduced net income levels and the effect of the non cash income tax benefit realized from reduced tax reserves 
we expect to generate cash flow from operations in with ongoing net income  as well as working capital gains through reduced accounts receivable and inventory levels as sales decline 
cash flow used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to the net redemption of or investment in fixed income securities  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
capital expenditures in totaled million and related to business operations and maintenance activities 
this has declined significantly from spending levels due to the completion of production and warehouse facility expansions 
we have budgeted approximately million of capital expenditures during fiscal to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities 
in and  net investment in fixed income securities of our on hand cash was million and million  respectively  as we invested excess cash 
in  the net sale of fixed income securities was primarily related to million of cash generated from the tender of our shares of tele atlas nv it is management s goal to invest the on hand cash consistent with garmin s investment policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
the investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital  maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity  and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk 
garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal  and were approximately  and  respectively 
in  cash flow used in investing activities also included the acquisition of metrigear  inc in  cash flow used in investing for acquisitions related to the purchase of european distributors 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million resulting from the use of million for payment of our declared dividend and million for stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan  partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock related to our company stock option plan and stock based compensation tax benefits 
the dividend paid was significantly higher than prior years as the dividend was increased to per share 
stock repurchases are made at the discretion of management under repurchase programs approved by the board of directors as business and market conditions warrant 
in  and  the company repurchased million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively 
we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures  to support our working capital requirements  to pay dividends and to repurchase shares 
we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  working capital  repurchase of shares  payment of dividends declared  and the funding of strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal contractual obligations and commercial commitments future commitments of garmin  as of december   aggregated by type of contractual obligation  are payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us  taiwan  europe  and canada 
we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials 
product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions 
historically  during cyclical industry downturns  we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar 
the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the currencies that create a majority of the company s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar  euro  and british pound sterling 
garmin corporation  headquartered in sijhih  taiwan  uses the local currency as the functional currency 
the company translates all assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year 
in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets  we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 
all european subsidiaries excluding garmin europe ltd  garmin danmark  garmin sweden  garmin polska and garmin norge use the euro as the functional currency 
the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary  garmin europe ltd 
remains the us dollar  and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros  foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows 
in  the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro and relative to the british pound sterling 
these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of million in garmin ltd 
and our european subsidiaries 
a loss of million resulted due to the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar 
the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of million  and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of million at the end of fiscal interest rate risk we have no outstanding long term debt as of december  we  therefore  have no meaningful debt related interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities 
as interest rates change  the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 
a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses 
at december   cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were million
