pac van leases and sells storage and office containers  modular buildings and mobile offices in the united states 
the economic downturn in the united states  particularly in the construction related industries where pac van has currently over of its business and historically has had over  and  until recently  the global economy in general  have had an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
to offset this adverse effect  we undertook cost reduction and other measures  particularly in the us  to reduce our indebtedness and to strive to comply with financial loan covenants 
reference is made to the liquidity and financial condition section for a discussion of the more significant capital transactions we undertook in improving our senior and other debt leverage position  including an initial public offering ipo in australia of a noncontrolling interest in royal wolf 
our long term strategy and business plan is to acquire and operate rental services and specialty finance businesses in north america  europe and the asia pacific area 
our two operating subsidiaries  royal wolf and pac van  lease and sell storage container products  modular buildings and mobile offices through seventeen customer service centers cscs in australia  six cscs in new zealand and twenty six branch locations across eighteen states in the united states 
as of june   we had and employees and  and  lease fleet units in the asia pacific area and united states  respectively 
we do business in two distinct  but related industries  mobile storage and modular space  which we collectively refer to as the portable services industry 
prior to our acquisition of pac van  our revenue mix was approximately sales and leasing 
however  during the year ended june  the mix was sales and leasing 
our products include the following mobile storage storage containers 
storage containers consist of new and used shipping containers that provide a flexible  low cost alternative to warehousing  while offering greater security  convenience and immediate accessibility 
our storage products include general purpose dry storage containers  refrigerated containers and specialty containers in a range of standard and modified sizes  designs and storage capacities 
specialty containers include blast resistant units  hoarding units and hazardous waste units

portable container buildings and office containers are either modified or specifically manufactured containers that provide self contained office space with maximum design flexibility 
office containers in the us are oftentimes referred to as ground level offices glos 
results of operations year ended june  fy compared to year ended june  fy the following compares our fy results of operations with our fy results of operations 
revenues 
revenues increased approximately to million in fy from million in fy this consisted of an increase of million  or  in revenues at royal wolf and a million decrease  or  in revenues at pac van 
the translation effect of the average currency exchange rate  driven by the strengthening in the australian dollar to the us dollar in fy versus fy  caused a portion of the increase in total revenues at royal wolf which otherwise would have shown an increase of 
this increase at royal wolf was reflected in most of the sectors in which we do business in the asia pacific area  but most significantly in the mining sector where revenues increased by approximately million  or  in fy from fy since the second half of our fy  the economic downturn  particularly in the construction related and government sectors  resulted in a significant reduction in our overall business in united states 
in fy  when compared to fy  revenues in these sectors decreased by million and million  respectively 
sales and leasing revenues represented and of total revenues  respectively  in both fy and fy sales during fy amounted to million  compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
this included an increase of million  or  in sales at royal wolf and a million decrease  or  in sales at pac van 
the translation effect of the average currency exchange rate  driven by the strengthening in the australian dollar to the us dollar in fy versus fy  caused a portion of the increase in sales revenues at royal wolf which otherwise would have shown an increase of 
in fy  sales in the asia pacific area increased million in our csc retail operations and million in our national accounts group or non retail operations from fy  primarily because of the enhanced activity in the mining  defense  building and construction sectors 
in the united states  the lower sales revenues in fy from fy were primarily from office containers  modular building and mobile office projects in the commercial  construction and government sectors 
the million revenue increase at royal wolf in the retail operations resulted from a million increase due to higher prices and a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of million  offset somewhat by a million decrease in unit sales 
the higher sales revenues were primarily due to increased demand in our cscs in western australia because of increased activities in the oil and gas exploration and defense sectors in that region  as well as increased business in our cscs  primarily in the queensland and victoria regions 
the million revenue increase at royal wolf in the national accounts group resulted from a million increase due to higher prices and a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of million  offset somewhat by a million decrease in unit sales 
fy revenues included the sales of mining container units versus units in fy for over million to a single customer 
leasing revenues during fy totaled million  as compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
leasing revenues increased at royal wolf by million  or  and increased million  or  at pac van 
the translation effect of the average currency exchange rate  driven by the strengthening in the australian dollar to the us dollar in fy versus fy  caused a portion of the increase in total revenues at royal wolf which otherwise would have shown an increase of 
the favorable foreign exchange rate effect at royal wolf in fy totaled million million and million in our retail business and national accounts group  respectively from fy ii 
table of contents at royal wolf  average utilization in the retail operations was during fy  as compared to during fy  and average utilization in the national accounts group operations was during fy  as compared to during fy overall average utilization at royal wolf was in fy and in fy  and the average monthly lease rate of containers was aus in fy as compared to aus in fy leasing revenues in fy increased in part as a result of demand for storage and accomodation units caused by the queensland  australia flooding and the christchurch  new zealand earthquake 
however  we believe the primary reasons we were able to both increase our overall average utilization and generally maintain our composite monthly lease rate between the periods at royal wolf were because of the improving economy in the asia pacific area and because of our position as the only company with a national footprint in the mobile storage industry in australia and new zealand 
we continually review each local market in which we do business to determine if local factors justify increases or decreases in lease rates and the effect these changes would have on utilization and revenues 
at pac van  average utilization rates were   and and monthly lease rates were   and for storage containers  office containers  mobile offices and modular units  respectively  during fy  as compared to   and and   and for storage containers  office containers  mobile offices and modular units in fy  respectively 
the generally lower monthly lease rates resulted from lower demand and increased competition as a result of the generally stagnant us economy 
the average composite utilization rate in fy was  as compared to in fy the average value of the australian dollar against the us dollar strengthened during fy as compared to fy the average currency exchange rate of one australian dollar during fy was us dollar compared to us dollar during fy this fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase to our total revenues at royal wolf of million in fy when compared to fy cost of sales 
cost of sales which is the cost related to our sales revenues only and exclusive of the line items discussed below increased by million to million during fy from million during fy  but was proportionately more profitable 
our gross profit percentage from sales revenues was in fy versus in fy direct costs of leasing operations and selling and general expenses 
direct costs of leasing operations which excludes depreciation and amortization and selling and general expenses aggregately increased by million million of which was at royal wolf to million during fy from million during fy as a percentage of revenues  these operating expenses were during fy and during fy  primarily due to non recurring expenses incurred in the royal wolf ipo totaling million and the adverse impact of the reduced revenues at pac van in fy from fy despite implementing cost cutting measures in the united states since the second half of the fiscal year ended june  to offset the effects of the economic downturn 
since the second half of fy  we implemented  primarily the united states  cost cutting measures that  among other things  consisted of salaries and related payroll costs as a result of staff reductions and lower bonuses  less discretionary spending and better control of our professional costs 
in general  pac van s operating expenses as a percentage of revenues would be higher than royal wolf s percentage as royal wolf s mix of fy sales to total revenues at is higher than the at pac van and pac van has less density in its retail markets 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of both fy and fy  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million and million  respectively  to goodwill recorded in the pac van acquisition 
reference is made to critical account estimates below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased slightly by million to million in fy from million in fy interest expense 
interest expense of million in fy was million higher than the million in fy this was comprised of an increase of million at royal wolf and million in the united states 
the weighted average interest rate at royal wolf was and in fy and fy  respectively  which does not include the effect of translation  interest rate swap contracts and options caps  amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalty and premium paid on the repayment of the bison capital subordinated notes in connection with the royal wolf ipo 
the weighted average interest rate in the united states was and in fy and fy  respectively  which does not include the effect of the amortization of deferred financing costs 
ii 
table of contents foreign currency exchange 
we had certain us dollar denominated debt at royal wolf  including intercompany borrowings  which were remeasured at each financial reporting date with the impact of the remeasurement being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from such remeasurement due to changes in the australian exchange rate to the us dollar had a significant impact in our reported results of operations  as well as any realized gains and losses from payments on such us dollar denominated debt and intercompany borrowings 
as noted above  the average value of the us dollar against the australian dollar weakened during fy as compared to fy and from june  to june  the currency exchange rate of one australian dollar at june  was us dollar compared to us dollar at june  the repayment of the us dollar denominated debt  including intercompany borrowings  at royal wolf in conjunction with the royal wolf ipo was the primary reason we recognized a net realized foreign exchange gain of million in fy also in fy  net unrealized losses on foreign exchange and forward currency exchange contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
in fy  net unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains totaled million and million  respectively  and net unrealized gains on forward currency exchange contracts totaled million 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in fy  as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of in fy  despite the fact that in both fiscal years there was a pretax loss 
the primary reason for a tax provision in fy versus a benefit was the royal wolf ipo  which triggered us federal and state income taxes as a result of changing the tax status of royal wolf from an over subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity which effectively considered royal wolf a domestic subsidiary that was included in our consolidated income tax returns to a majority owned foreign corporation which effectively excludes it from our consolidated income tax returns 
among other things  this change required us to increase  for tax purposes  the cost basis of royal wolf s inventory to fair value  which resulted in a taxable gain of approximately million 
in addition  in both fy and fy  the effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility for us federal income tax purposes of the goodwill impairment charge and a portion of the depreciation and amortization on the fixed and intangible assets recorded in the pac van acquisition  offset somewhat by the favorable income tax impact of the amortization of goodwill acquired in acquisitions made in the asia pacific area  which until the royal wolf ipo was deductible for us income tax reporting purposes 
we also file tax returns in multiple us states  which would generally increase our effective tax rate 
reference is made to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding income taxes 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest  which until the royal wolf ipo at may  represented bison capital s interest in royal wolf  was a charge of million in fy  as compared to million in fy  primarily reflecting the enhanced redemption value of the bison capital put option to the final accretion value of million 
reference is made to the liquidity and financial condition section and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the bison capital put option 
effective june   noncontrolling interest represents the pro rata share in the royal wolf results of operations of the shareholders of the rwh capital stock  other than us 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million fy  as compared to a net loss of million in fy  primarily as a result of non recurring expenses incurred in the royal wolf ipo totaling million  the accretion of the bison capital put option  higher interest expense and income tax provision in fy from fy  offset somewhat by the increased profitability in the asia pacific area 
measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap earnings before interest  income taxes  impairment  depreciation and amortization and other non operating costs and income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with us gaap 
these measures are not measurements of our financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  income from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ii 
table of contents adjusted ebitda is a non us gaap measure 
we calculate adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations 
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider each to be appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
we present adjusted ebitda because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  many of which present ebitda and a form of our adjusted ebitda when reporting their results 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
the following table shows our adjusted ebitda and the reconciliation from net income loss in thousands year ended june  net loss add provision benefit for income taxes foreign currency exchange gain and other interest expense interest income depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill share based compensation expense shares of rwh capital stock issued at ipo to royal wolf board of directors and executive management provision for shares of rwh capital stock to be purchased and awarded to royal wolf senior management team loyalty  past performance and successful ipo bonus to royal wolf executive and senior management team adjusted ebitda our business is capital intensive  so from an operating level we focus primarily on ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
these measures provide us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and fleet growth objectives 
in managing our business  we regularly compare our adjusted ebitda margins on a monthly basis 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch or csc  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis  when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability and adjusted ebitda margins 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
liquidity and financial condition each of our two operating units  royal wolf and pac van  fund their operations substantially through secured bank credit facilities that require compliance with various covenants 
these covenants require them to  among other things  maintain certain levels of interest coverage  ebitda as defined  utilization rate and overall leverage 
in addition  we have a subordinated notes payable by gfn to laminar direct capital  llc laminar 
we also have a million credit facility with union bank at gfn under which no borrowings were outstanding as of june  the economic downturn in the united states  particularly in the construction related industries where pac van has currently over of its business and historically has had over  and  until recently  the global economy in general  had an adverse impact on our operating results 
to offset this adverse effect  we undertook cost reduction and other measures  particularly in the us  to reduce our indebtedness and to strive to comply with financial loan covenants 
in addition  we undertook various capital events  the most significant of which are as follows on june   we completed a rights offering for the issuance and sale of units at each with each unit consisting of one share of gfn common stock and a three year warrant to purchase additional shares of gfn common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we utilized  of the approximately  net proceeds from the rights offering in the refinancing at pac van in fy see below 
ii 
table of contents prior to july   pac van had a senior credit facility  as amended  with a syndicate of four financial institutions led by bank of america  na boa  as administrative and collateral agent  and a  senior subordinated secured note payable to spv capital funding  llc spv 
on july   we entered into several agreements relating to a a new  senior secured revolving credit facility at pac van with a syndicate led by pnc bank  national association pnc and including wells fargo bank  national association and union bank the pnc credit facility  and b a new  senior subordinated note issued by gfn to laminar the laminar note 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility and proceeds from both the issuance of the laminar note and our rights offering see above were used to prepay in full all borrowings under the boa credit facility and the  senior subordinated secured note payable to spv 
the pnc credit facility matures on january  and the laminar note matures on july  on may   we completed an ipo in australia of a noncontrolling interest in rwh 
a total of  shares of capital stock were issued to the australian market at aus per share  resulting in gross proceeds of  aus 
an additional total of  shares  value were issued to the non employee members of the rwh board of directors  the rwh chief executive officer and the rwh chief financial officer 
previously  gfn us owned the only capital stock outstanding of rwh 
in conjunction with the ipo  rwh undertook a share split which resulted in gfn us receiving  shares of the new capital stock 
we used the proceeds of the rwh ipo to  among other things  pay offering costs of  aus  pay down borrowings at each of the senior credit facilities  as well as fully repay the subordinated notes held by bison capital 
simultaneously  we also satisfied the bison capital put option to acquire the of gfn us previously owned by bison capital 
we now own of gfn us and still own a majority of royal wolf 
royal wolf has an approximately  aus  senior credit facility with australia and new zealand banking group limited anz  which matures on june  the anz credit facility 
the anz credit facility was substantially amended in connection with the royal wolf ipo and is comprised of three sub facilities  a  aus  working capital sub facility  primarily for receivable financing  a  aus  revolving sub facility  primarily for lease fleet purchases  and a  acquisition sub facility 
reference is made to notes   and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the royal wolf ipo  rights offering  senior and other debt and other obligations  such as the bison capital put option 
as of june   our required principal and other obligations payments for the year ending june  and the subsequent three fiscal years are as follows in thousands year ending june  anz credit facility a pnc credit facility b laminar note c other a reflects primarily the working capital sub facilities as due within the next twelve months 
these should continually roll over and would be fully repaid at the maturity of the anz credit facility in june b scheduled to mature in january c scheduled to mature in july we have significantly improved our financial position  particularly in the asia pacific area  and we intend in the foreseeable future to utilize our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity in that region to expand our sale inventory and lease fleet by making both capital expenditures and acquisitions to meet the increasing business demands 
in the us  where the markets in which we do business in remain stagnant  we will continue to monitor the senior and other debt leverage at pac van 
however  we do intend on prudently expanding our storage and office container lease fleet at pac van and would also look at accretive acquisition opportunities 
we currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock and do not intend on doing so in the foreseeable future 
cash flow for fy compared to fy our leasing business is capital intensive  and we acquire leasing assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
these leasing assets have long useful lives and require relatively minimal maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our branch and csc locations and to add to the breadth of our product mix 
our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our reported earnings  which would include  even in profitable periods  the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
ii 
table of contents as we discussed above  our principal source of capital for operations consists of funds available from the senior secured credit facility with anz and the pnc credit facility 
we also finance a smaller portion of capital requirements through finance leases and lease purchase contracts  have a million line of credit with union bank and have an outstanding subordinated note with laminar 
supplemental information pertaining to our combined sources and uses of cash is presented in the table below in thousands year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used by used in financing activities operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million during fy  an increase of million from the million provided during fy this was primarily because deferred taxes were million greater in fy than fy  as the net loss was approximately million for both years 
historically  cash flow provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  operating cash flows benefited by non cash add backs totaling million for unrealized losses from foreign exchange and forward exchange contracts in fy versus non cash reductions of million for unrealized gains in fy these items were substantially offset by cash flow of million used in the management of operating assets and liabilities in fy  primarily as a result of increased fleet investments in the asia pacific area  as compared to cash flow of million provided in fy in both fy and fy  operating cash flow was enhanced by non cash adjustments of depreciation and amortization on fixed and intangible assets of million and million  respectively  and  in addition  during both years  operating cash flows were reduced by gains on the sales of lease fleet totaling million in fy and million in fy investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million during fy  as compared to million provided during fy during fy  purchases of property  plant and equipment  or rolling stock  were approximately million in fy and million in fy  and net capital expenditures of lease fleet purchases  net of proceeds from sales of lease fleet were million in fy and million in fy we increased our investing in the lease fleet in the asia pacific area during fy to meet the demands of the additional business from its improving economy 
however  we continued to scrutinize capital expenditures in the united states and anticipate our near term investing activities domestically to be primarily focused on acquiring containers 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion and  other than a preferred supply agreement which requires us to purchase yearly up to  containers  if offered to us see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have no significant long term contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we may be required to purchase at a certain price or a minimum amount of goods or services 
in fy  we acquired through pac van  in two separate transactions  the business of advanced mobile storage for a total of million in cash 
we made no acquisitions in fy financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fy  as compared to million used during fy in fy  we completed an ipo in australia of a noncontrolling interest in royal wolf for net proceeds of million and  in fy  we completed a rights offering that resulted in net proceeds of million 
over million of the net proceeds from the royal wolf ipo in fy was used to reduce outstanding borrowings and to satisfy the bison put option see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of the net proceeds from the rights offering completed in fy was used in the pac van refinancing during the first quarter of fy all told  in fy  we repaid a net million on senior and other debt borrowings  including the full repayment of the subordinated notes due bison capital see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  satisfied the bison capital put option for million and incurred deferred financing costs of million during the refinancing at pac van and the substantial amendment of the anz credit facility 
in fy  we reduced our outstanding borrowings by million 
since the second half of our fiscal year ended june   reducing the overall senior and other debt leverage  particularly in the united states  has been a principal objective 
ii 
table of contents asset management receivables and inventories including foreign translation effect were million and million at june  and million and million at june   respectively 
inventory levels have increased at june  from june   due primarily to the improving economy in the asia pacific area  but effective asset management remains a significant focus  as we strive to continue to apply appropriate credit and collection controls and reduce inventory levels to maintain and enhance cash flow and profitability 
at june   days sales outstanding dso in trade receivables were days and days for royal wolf and pac van  as compared to days and days at june   respectively 
the net book value of our total lease fleet increased including foreign translation effect from million at june  to million at june  at june   we had  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states in our lease fleet  as compared  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states at june  at those dates   units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states and  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states were on lease  respectively 
in the united states  the lease fleet was comprised of  storage containers   office containers   mobile offices and modular units at june   and  storage containers   office containers   mobile offices and modular units at june  at those dates  in the united states  units on lease were comprised of  storage containers  office containers   mobile offices and modular units  and  storage containers  office containers   mobile offices and modular units  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
seasonality although demand from certain customer segments can be seasonal  our operations as a whole are not seasonal to any significant extent 
we experience a reduction in sales volumes at royal wolf during australia s summer holiday break from mid december to the end of january  followed by february being a short working day month 
however  this reduction in sales typically is counterbalanced by the increased lease revenues derived from the removals or moving and storage industry  which experiences its seasonal peak of personnel relocations during this same summer holiday break 
demand from some of pac van s customers can be seasonal  such as in the construction industry  which tends to increase leasing activity in the first and fourth quarters  while customers in the retail industry tend to lease more units in the second quarter 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
however  during periods of rising prices and  in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
ii 
table of contents we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
accordingly  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
on a recurring basis  we evaluate a variety of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers  days outstanding trends  a review of historical collection results and a review of specific past due receivables 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net income 
to date  uncollectible accounts have been within the range of our expectations 
we lease and sell storage  building and office containers  modular buildings and mobile offices to our customers 
leases to customers generally qualify as operating leases unless there is a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a fleet of storage  building and office containers  mobile offices  modular buildings and steps that we lease to customers under operating lease agreements with varying terms 
the lease fleet or lease or rental equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life years  after the date the units are put in service  and are depreciated down to their estimated residual values up to of cost 
in our opinion  estimated residual values are at or below net realizable values 
we periodically review these depreciation policies in light of various factors  including the practices of the larger competitors in the industry  and our own historical experience 
for the issuances of stock options  we follow the fair value provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
fasb asc topic requires recognition of employee share based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of the purchase option is the black scholes pricing model 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  market prices and volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
in particular  prior to july   we used volatility rates based upon a sample of comparable companies our industry and we now use a volatility rate based on the performance of our common stock  which yields a higher rate 
in addition we use a risk free interest rate  which is the rate on us treasury instruments  for a security with a maturity that approximates the estimated remaining expected term of the stock option 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
fasb asc topic prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we operate two reportable and operating segments pac van and royal wolf 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these two reporting units 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at june using the two step process required under fasb asc topic the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we would also consider performing impairment tests during an interim reporting period in which significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that a permanent impairment may have occurred 
some factors we consider important which could trigger such an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant changes during the period in our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
at june  and  we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined on a weighted average range of multiples to adjusted ebitda 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit was based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach was dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures and discount rates 
each approach was given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the net assets of any reporting unit would have exceeded its fair value  a step two impairment test would have been performed 
in a step two test  we would be required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
generally  this would involve allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the respective assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in separate and individual business combination and the fair value was the price paid to acquire it with the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities being the implied fair value of goodwill 
it was determined that the fair value of the royal wolf reporting unit exceeded the carrying values of the net assets at june  and however  the fair value of the pac van reporting unit was less than the carrying values the net assets at june  and  therefore  we performed a step two impairment test for pac van 
in the step two test for pac van  the implied value of its goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of  and  at june  and  respectively 
the company had not recorded an impairment charge to goodwill prior to june  ii 
table of contents intangible assets include those with indefinite trademark and trade name  and finite primarily customer base and lists  non compete agreements and deferred financing costs useful lives 
customer base and lists and non compete agreements are amortized on the straight line basis over the expected period of benefit which range from one to ten years 
costs to obtaining long term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the straight line method 
amortizing the deferred financing costs using the straight line method does not produce significantly different results than that of the effective interest method 
we review intangibles those assets resulting from acquisitions at least annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
at june  and  we  pursuant to an evaluation that determined that the respective fair values were less than the carrying values  recognized impairment charges of  and  respectively  to the trade name and  at june    to the customer base acquired in the pac van acquisition 
these impairment charges were recorded as a part of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance would be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we would increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance would be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges and other market driven rates or prices 
exposure to interest rates and currency risks arises in the normal course of our business and we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe we have no material market risks to our operations  financial position or liquidity as a result of derivative activities  including forward exchange contracts
